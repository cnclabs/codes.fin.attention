in connection with the termination and sale lease back of these eight communities  the company will recognize a loss of approximately million  which will be recorded as lease expense due to residual value guarantees 
of the million of lease expense  the company recorded million during the quarter ended december   and anticipates that it will complete the sale lease back transactions and record the balance of approximately million of additional lease expense during the first and second quarters of see business synthetic lease communities and sale lease back transactions 
lease classification as of december   the company operates many of its senior living communities under long term leases

goodwill goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited  generally years 
the company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by determining whether the amortization of the balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation

the assessment of the recoverability will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
the company has million of unamortized goodwill as of december   which will be subject to the transition provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company will evaluate the existence of impairment under sfas no 
by the end of the second fiscal quarter of inherent in the policies regarding goodwill are the significant management judgments regarding the ongoing cash flow potential of the acquired communities which generated the goodwill

as a result of these current maturities  the company had a net working capital deficit of million as of december  in order to satisfy or extend these obligations and to address its net working capital deficit  the company has developed the refinancing plan in consultation with its investment banking advisor and its legal counsel and through discussions with its lenders

in addition to these recently completed transactions  the company has either executed definitive  binding agreements or is in advanced discussions with several different parties relating to the refinancing or sale lease back of up to additional communities 
if completed on the terms being considered  these proposed transactions would generate gross proceeds to the company of approximately million prior to payment of related debt and transaction costs of approximately million 
furthermore  the company is in advanced discussions with certain of its existing lenders concerning the amendment or removal of the company s financial covenants following consummation of the refinancing plan 
these transactions and discussions are in various stages and in certain instances are non binding 
all of these transactions will be subject to conditions and approvals that must be satisfied 
some of these transactions may be dilutive to current equity holders 
if the foregoing transactions are consummated as currently contemplated  the debentures will be the company s primary remaining outstanding debt obligation maturing in in order to address the maturity of the debentures by or before october  the company has entered into a non binding letter of intent with a third party that will provide the company with approximately million of term mezzanine financing involving certain of its retirement centers 
the company intends to use the net proceeds from this transaction  together with the net proceeds generated by the transactions described above  to address final resolution of the outstanding debentures and to satisfy its working capital requirements 
the letter of intent regarding this transaction is preliminary and non binding  and is subject to conditions that must be satisfied prior to closing including certain approvals and consents 
if the company is able to reach a definitive agreement with respect to this proposed mezzanine financing  the transaction is expected to close during the second or third quarter of the company currently anticipates completing the balance of its refinancing plan prior to october of nevertheless  the refinancing plan and its various remaining components are subject to a number of contingencies  uncertainties and conditions that are outside of the company s control  and are dependent upon the receipt of required approvals and consents 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate its refinancing plan 
the failure to consummate the refinancing plan  or another plan to extend  refinance or repay the company s debts  will have a material adverse effect upon the company  will result in the company having insufficient capital to satisfy its maturing obligations and could make it necessary for the company to seek protection from its creditors 
in the event that the company successfully consummates its refinancing plan  it will remain highly leveraged with a substantial amount of debt and lease obligations  and will have increased interest and lease expenses 
the company is also likely to incur certain costs  including significant non cash charges in connection with the consummation of the refinancing plan

the company s variable rate indebtedness carried a weighted average rate of as of december  at december   the company s scheduled debt maturities during the twelve months ended december  totaled million  including million of mortgage debt and million of debentures 
in addition  the company has minimum rental obligations of million under long term operating leases due in as of december   the company had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and had negative working capital of million  related mainly to the debt maturing in the company expects that its current cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  and the proceeds from certain recently completed financings will be sufficient to fund its operating requirements  its capital expenditure requirements and its periodic debt service requirements during however  the company s internally generated cash will not be sufficient to satisfy its scheduled debt maturities in accordingly  the company s ability to satisfy its maturing obligations will depend primarily upon its ability to execute and implement its refinancing plan 
the terms of the transactions and agreements comprising the refinancing plan will likely impose significant burdens on the company and may be dilutive to the company s existing shareholders 
see refinancing plan 
many of the company s credit and other agreements contain restrictive covenants that include  among other things  the maintenance of minimum tangible net worth  prescribed debt service coverage  liquidity  capital expenditure reserves and occupancy levels 
in addition  certain of these agreements require that the company raise a prescribed amount of capital and provide evidence of sufficient capacity to pay off its debentures by july  effective as of december   the company and certain of its lenders and lessors agreed to amendments or waivers relating to many of these financial covenants and agreements in order to allow the company to remain in compliance 
the company is unlikely to be able to comply with many of its financial covenants in the future absent further concessions or waivers from certain of its creditors 
there can be no assurances that the company s creditors will grant further amendments or waivers in the event of such non compliance 
failure to remain in compliance with its financial covenants would have a material adverse impact on the company  and would result in a default under a substantial majority of the company s indebtedness and other obligations  and could result in an acceleration of the maturity of those obligations 
a significant amount of the company s indebtedness and lease agreements is cross defaulted 
any non payment or other default with respect to such obligations including non compliance with a financial covenant could cause lenders to declare defaults  accelerate payment obligations or foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or exercise their remedies with respect to such communities 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its debt instruments or lease agreements is likely to result in a default or acceleration of substantially all of the company s other obligations  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has engaged in  and anticipates continuing  discussions with its existing lenders and other lenders  lessors and third parties in order to implement the refinancing plan 
while the company anticipates completing the refinancing plan prior to october  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to do so or that the company will be able to satisfy its maturing obligations 
in addition  the terms of the transactions comprising the refinancing plan may not be as expected 
the company s ability to consummate the refinancing plan depends upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include the satisfaction of conditions relating to various components of the refinancing plan  the company s financial condition and operating performance  the financial strength of the assets to be sold or leveraged  the requirement for regulatory approvals  as well as certain approvals and consents  general economic conditions  general conditions in the credit markets  the condition of the senior living industry  mortgage interest rates  the company s equity in any particular community and other factors 
the company s efforts will be adversely affected by the condition of the assisted living market in general  the insolvency or weakened financial conditions of many assisted living competitors  a reduced number of lenders willing to finance assisted living or retirement companies  the substantial fill up costs associated with the company s free standing als and the fact that the company is highly leveraged 
the company s financial condition  resulting in the going concern opinion in its consolidated financial statements  could adversely effect the company s ability to retain existing residents  attract prospective residents  maintain customary terms of payment from its vendors  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and liquidity 
the company believes that  if consummated as currently planned  the refinancing plan will satisfy the scheduled debt maturities during  as well as the company s negative working capital 
in the event that the company successfully consummates its refinancing plan  it will continue to be highly leveraged  and will have substantial debt and lease obligations  and will have increased interest and lease expenses 
the company is also likely to incur certain costs  including significant non cash charges in connection with the consummation of the refinancing plan

the company views these transactions as long term financings 
as such  the company has recorded debt of million and million related to broadway plaza at pecan park and the homewood residence at boca raton 
as such  the company believes that while losses are recorded based on sales price  this is not indicative of the ultimate value of the leaseholds 
additional value may be created through the earn out provisions of the agreements  as well as the company continuing to benefit from any improvement in operating results as the communities increase occupancy and performance

recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the company is required to adopt sfas no later than the year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending march  management does not expect the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from fasb statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
the provisions of the sfas for assets held for sale or other disposals generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas will have on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
the company is required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
the company has yet to determine the impact  if any  from the adoption of sfas in july  the fasb issued statement  business combinations sfas  and statement  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria for intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas is effective january  and will require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and that reviews for impairment be conducted in accordance with sfas  and subsequently after its adoption 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company is required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  the company will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of opreation 
the company has million of unamortized goodwill as of january   which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million for both years ended december  and because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
related party transactions the company places an emphasis on identifying material transactions with parties known to be related to ensure that terms of any transactions are such that clearly independent third parties would be able to negotiate similar transactions

the company s current financial condition may have a detrimental effect on the company s ability to retain existing residents  attract prospective residents  and attract and retain key employees 
in addition  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s payment terms from its vendors  negotiations with its various lenders and insurance carriers  ability to obtain necessary permits and licenses  or have other negative impact on its business operations 
substantial debt and operating lease payment obligations at december   the company had long term debt  including current portion  of million and was obligated to pay minimum rental obligations in of approximately million under long term operating leases 
the company has developed its refinancing plan in order to satisfy or extend its scheduled debt maturities during if the company is able to consummate the refinancing plan  a substantial portion of the company s scheduled debt maturities will be extended to maturities after january the company will incur certain costs  including significant non cash losses as a result of certain refinancing plan transactions  which will reduce shareholders equity 
as a result  even if the company consummates the refinancing plan  it will have significant debt and operating lease obligations in future periods  and a substantial portion of the company s cash flow will be devoted to debt service and lease payments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate the refinancing plan or  if the refinancing plan is consummated  that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet required interest  principal  and lease payments in future periods 
in addition  the company s interest and lease payments will increase significantly if the refinancing plan is consummated 
many of the company s current debt agreements and leases contain various financial and other restrictive covenants  which may restrict the company s flexibility in operating its business 
the company is negotiating with its existing lenders to remove these restrictive covenants or to amend these covenants to levels that the company believes it can satisfy for the foreseeable future  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to remove or amend these covenants 
any payment or other default with respect to such obligations could cause lenders to cease funding and accelerate payment obligations or to foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate the lease  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its payment obligations is likely to result in default or acceleration of a majority of the company s other obligations 
consequently  such a default would adversely affect a significant number of the company s other properties and  in turn  the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
fill up of free standing als over the past several years  the company has experienced significant losses associated with the fill up of a large number of free standing als  most of which began operations during and in addition  the free standing al segment of the senior living industry is experiencing significant competition  overcapacity and price competition 
the company acquired leasehold interests in managed spe communities during  ten of which were acquired on december   and acquired leasehold interests in managed spe communities during there can be no assurance that these free standing als will increase occupancy percentages or increase operating margins in future periods  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
highly competitive industry the senior living and health care services industry is highly competitive  and the company expects that all providers within the industry will continue to be competitive in the future 
the company competes with other companies providing independent living  assisted living  skilled nursing  and other similar service and care alternatives 
although the company believes there is a need for senior living communities in the markets where the company is operating and developing communities  the company expects that competition will continue from existing competitors and new market entrants  some of whom may have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors operate on a not for profit basis or as charitable organizations and have the ability to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or through the receipt of charitable contributions  neither of which are readily available to the company 
the company also competes with many assisted living companies that are currently insolvent or that could become insolvent in the future 
these competitors may gain a competitive advantage over the company as a result of the effect of bankruptcy reorganization or other insolvency proceedings 
furthermore  the development of new free standing al communities has exceeded the demand for such communities in certain of the markets in which the company has free standing al communities 
an oversupply of such communities in certain of the company s markets has caused the company to experience slower fill up than projected  competitive pricing pressures and price discounting 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to encounter these conditions or that competitive conditions will not adversely affect its financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
liability insurance and risks of liability claims the provision of personal and health care services entails an inherent risk of liability 
in recent years  participants in the senior living and health care services industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence or related legal theories  many of which involve large claims and result in the incurrence of significant defense costs and significant exposure 
the company currently maintains property  liability  and professional medical malpractice insurance policies for the company s owned and certain of its managed communities under a master insurance program 
the number of insurance companies willing to provide general liability and professional malpractice liability insurance for the nursing and assisted living industry has declined dramatically and the premiums and deductibles associated with such insurance has risen substantially in recent years 
the company s liability insurance policies since july  have contained significantly higher deductibles than in prior periods 
deductibles now range from  to  depending on the type of claim 
as a result of these increased deductibles  the company is incurring significantly higher insurance accruals for potential liability claims  as well as increased premiums 
furthermore  as part of the renewal of the company s insurance policies in july  four incidents were excluded from policy coverage 
to date  the company believes one of these incidents may result in liability and has accrued for the estimated costs of the claim 
there can be no assurance that a claim in excess of the company s insurance will not arise 
a claim against the company not covered by  or in excess of  the company s insurance including any related judgments  settlements or costs could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future or that  if such insurance is available  it will be available on acceptable terms 
community management  staffing  and labor costs the company competes with other providers of senior living and health care services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of the company s communities and skilled technical personnel responsible for providing resident care 
in certain markets  a shortage of nurses or trained personnel has required the company to enhance its wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of such personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
the company will also be heavily dependent on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which it operates 
the company has experienced a competitive labor market  periodic shortages of qualified workers in certain markets  and increasing wage rates for many of these employees during the past year 
the company cannot be sure its labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents 
if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified management and staff personnel  control its labor costs  or pass on increased labor costs to residents through rate increases  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
exposure to rising interest rates future indebtedness  from commercial banks or otherwise  and lease obligations  including those related to reit facilities  are expected to be based on interest rates prevailing at the time such debt and lease arrangements are obtained 
as of december   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
increases in prevailing interest rates would increase the company s interest or lease payment obligations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks associated with lifecare benefits six of the communities operated by the company are lifecare ccrcs that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these communities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community 
this limited lifecare benefit  is typically a a certain number of free days in the community s health center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined from actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for the communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of the communities would be adversely affected 
residents of the company s lifecare ccrcs are guaranteed an independent living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives  the community must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although the company screens potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to the communities during their lifetime  there can be no assurance that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
if insufficient  the company has rights of set off against the refundable portions of the residents deposits  and would also seek available reimbursement under medicaid or other available programs 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that the communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of the communities  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
risks of operations in concentrated geographic areas part of the company s business strategy is to own  lease or manage senior living communities in concentrated geographic service areas 
the company has a large concentration of communities in florida  texas  and colorado  among other areas 
accordingly  the company s occupancy rates and operating results in certain of its communities may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including regional and local economic conditions  competitive conditions  applicable local laws and regulations  and general real estate market conditions  including the supply and proximity of other senior living communities 
dependence on attracting residents with sufficient resources to pay approximately of the company s total revenues for were attributable to private pay sources 
the company expects to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for the company s services from their own or familial financial resources 
inflation  a change in general economic conditions or other circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors to pay for the company s services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
government regulation and the burdens of compliance federal and state governments regulate various aspects of the company s business 
the development and operation of health care facilities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal  state  and local licensure  certification  and inspection laws that regulate  among other matters  the number of licensed beds  the provision of services  staffing levels  professional licensing  the distribution of pharmaceuticals  billing practices and policies  equipment  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention measures  environmental matters  and compliance with building and safety codes 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement  the imposition of fines  temporary suspension of admission of new patients  suspension or decertification from medicare  medicaid  or other state or federal reimbursement programs  restrictions on the company s ability to acquire new communities or expand existing communities  and  in extreme cases  the revocation of a community s license or closure of a community 
while the company endeavors to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to penalties in the future  or that federal  state  or local governments will not impose restrictions on the company s activities that could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing  and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to manage its exposure 
the swap involves the receipt of a fixed interest rate payment in exchange for the payment of a variable rate interest payment without exchanging the notional principal amount 
receipts on the agreement are recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
at december   the company s outstanding principal under its existing swap agreement was million maturing july  under the agreement the company receives fixed rate of and pays floating rates based upon libor and a foreign currency index with a maximum rate through july  of 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  since of the company s debt has fixed rates 
there can be no assurances  however  that interest rates will not significantly change and materially affect the company 
additionally  the company anticipates refinancing and or renegotiating certain debt in  which  if consummated  would result in higher interest rates in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to refinance and or renegotiate any of its indebtedness
