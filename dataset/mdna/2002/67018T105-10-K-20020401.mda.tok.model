revenue recognition policies were explained above 
the company operates in countries and generates the majority of its revenue and income in foreign currencies in international markets

in addition  the company pays income taxes in many foreign jurisdictions based on the profits realized in such jurisdictions  which can be significantly impacted by terms of intercompany transactions between the company and its foreign affiliates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are created in this process and the company records such tax obligations in accordance with appropriate accounting standards as explained in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements

in local currency  revenue in japan increased in over the company s nine year history in japan  the economy of japan has been stagnant 
while such economic times may benefit recruitment of new distributors  more severe economic challenges can negatively impact overall revenue 
in  the strength of key nu skin and pharmanex products launched as well as the successful promotion of the automatic repurchasing programs and the initiation of personalized web sites for distributors drove growth in japan 
the decline in revenue in japan in us dollar terms was partially offset by an increase in revenue in south korea of to million in from million in in local currency  revenue in south korea was higher in compared to the prior year 
the continued revenue growth in south korea in us dollars and local currency is attributed primarily to an improving economy as well as a rebound in the direct selling industry as a whole in south korea

revenue in the united states in includes an additional million of revenue generated from the peo over the prior year 
the company has incubated the peo service with a view of possibly launching the service through its distributor networks at some point in the future

in addition  the international convention held in the united states in february generated approximately million in revenue from sales to international distributors attending the convention 
more than offsetting this additional revenue in the united states  revenue from the company s core business in the united states was negatively impacted by distributor uncertainty relating to the company s divisional strategies and the decreased focus on unprofitable products such as the free iphone promotion and certain ilink telecommunications products 
in addition  the changes made by the company to address these concerns were announced in early september of  just prior to the tragic events of september   which delayed the impact of the announced changes 
revenue in the company s other markets  which include its european and latin american operations  increased to million in from million in this increase in revenue is due to a increase in revenue in europe in us dollars compared to the prior year 
in local currency  revenue in europe increased approximately during compared to the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from the weakening of the japanese yen and other currencies relative to the us dollar  which negatively impacted margins by  and the increased revenue relating to the peo  which carries significantly lower gross margins than the company s other products and negatively impacted margins by 
these factors were partially offset by gross margin improvement in core nu skin and pharmanex products

distributor incentives as a percentage of revenue remained constant at in and distributor incentives increased to million in from million in as a result of the slight revenue increase in prior to  the company restructured a portion of its compensation plan for distributors  adding short term incentives designed to attract new distributor leaders

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decreases resulted primarily from a weaker japanese yen in as well as the company s cost saving initiatives including reductions in headcount and occupancy costs

the international convention is held every months and accordingly  year results did not include convention expenses 
other income expense  net increased million in compared to the prior year 
this increase related primarily to a million gain from the sale of an interest in the company s malaysian subsidiary 
provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in this decrease was largely due to a decrease in operating income as compared to the prior year  offset by an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in net income decreased to million in from million in net income decreased primarily because of the factors noted above in gross profit and distributor incentives and was somewhat offset by the factors noted in revenue  selling  general and administrative  other income expense  net and provision for income taxes above

revenue in north asia decreased to million compared to million in this decrease in revenue was due to revenue in japan decreasing to million in from million in in local currency terms  revenue in japan was lower in versus the prior year 
the decrease in revenue in japan was largely due to challenges with distributor productivity and competition faced by the company in and early in the year in addition  economic uncertainty in japan negatively impacted revenue 
in  the company undertook several initiatives to help stabilize revenue in japan  including the launch of the pharmanex business opportunity for distributors early in the year  increased focus on its automatic delivery program and the launch of the pharmanex web site product epharmanex late in the year and other initiatives 
the overall decline in revenue in japan in was somewhat offset by an increase in revenue in south korea of to million in from million in the revenue increase in south korea was primarily due to significant new product launches in including pharmanex s weight management products and nu skin  as well as an overall increase in the number of executive level distributors 
revenue in southeast asia totaled million in  down from revenue of million in  a decrease of million or 
this decline in revenue was primarily a result of revenue in taiwan decreasing to million in from million in the company s operations in taiwan were adversely affected by increased competition and an overall decline in sales in the direct selling industry in taiwan  which management believes is largely due to economic concerns throughout southeast asia 
in addition  direct selling as a distribution channel has significantly penetrated the taiwanese market 
the revenue decline in southeast asia was partially offset by the opening of the market in singapore which generated million in revenue in one month of operation in in addition  the revenue from the company s retail operations opened in china in was million 
other markets in the region such as hong kong  thailand  the philippines  australia and new zealand were slightly down in versus due largely to economic uncertainty in the region as well as negative foreign currency impact for the year 
revenue in north america  consisting of the united states and canada  increased to million in  from million in this increase in revenue is due to the inclusion of a full year of operations of big planet following its acquisition in july as well as a full year of operations of the company s north america sales operations following the termination of the license agreements in march revenue in the big planet division increased million due to the timing of the acquisition as well as growth within big planet in the year in addition  revenue in north america  exclusive of big planet  increased by million due to a full year of revenue from sales to distributors in north america during  following the early acquisitions 
revenue in the united states decreased sequentially during the last two quarters of the year primarily as a result of the termination of big planet s iphone giveaway and weaker than anticipated sales during the fourth quarter holiday season 
the company made the strategic decision to terminate the iphone giveaway in order to improve operating profits 
revenue in the company s other markets  which include its european  latin american and brazilian operations  increased to million in this increase was largely due to a increase in local currency revenue in europe  more than making up for the negative currency impact experienced in europe in from gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained constant at in and the company s gross margin in was positively impacted by the strengthening of the japanese yen and other asian currencies relative to the us dollar  higher margin sales to distributors in the united states following the termination of the company s license agreement with nu skin usa  increased local manufacturing efforts and reduced duty rates 
the company purchases a significant majority of goods in us dollars and recognizes revenue in local currencies 
consequently  the company is subject to exchange rate risks in its gross margins 
this positive impact was offset by the overall growth in revenue from big planet in  which includes revenue from lower margin technology products and services 
distributor incentives as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in the primary reason for the increase in was the termination of the company s license agreement with nu skin usa  which resulted in the company beginning to sell products directly to distributors in the united states and paying the requisite commissions related to those sales 
in addition  the company has enhanced its compensation plan for distributors  adding short term incentives for emerging distributor leaders 
this resulted in a slight increase in distributor incentives 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in in us dollar terms  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase of million was due primarily to an additional million of selling  general and administrative expenses related to the assumed operations of big planet for a full year in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses from big planet following its acquisition in mid in addition  the company incurred an incremental million of overhead expenses during compared to for operations in north america following the acquisition of certain assets from nu skin usa in march and the north american affiliates in may selling  general and administrative expenses also increased due to a stronger japanese yen in on a local currency basis  selling  general and administrative expenses in foreign markets declined slightly in from  but due to a stronger japanese yen  the us dollar amount of such expenses increased by million 
other income expense  net increased million in compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the foreign currency gains resulting from favorable exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen within the company s currency hedging program 
in addition  the company s interest expense decreased by approximately million relating to the company s pay down of its long term debt 
provision for income taxes decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily related to lower income earned in versus  which was somewhat offset by the lower effective tax rate of in versus in the lower effective tax rate in was due to the improved ability to utilize foreign tax credits as a result of the company s global tax restructuring plans in that period 
net income decreased to million in from million in net income decreased primarily because of the factors noted above in revenue  distributor incentives and selling  general and administrative and was somewhat offset by the factors noted in other income expense  net and provision for income taxes above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s principal needs for funds have been for operating expenses including distributor incentives  working capital principally inventory purchases  capital expenditures and the development of operations in new markets 
the company has generally relied on cash flow from operations to meet its cash needs and business objectives without incurring long term debt to fund operating activities 
the company typically generates positive cash flow from operations due to favorable gross margins  the variable nature of distributor incentives which comprise a significant percentage of operating expenses and minimal capital requirements 
the company generated million in cash from operations in compared to million in this increase in cash generated from operations in compared to the prior year period is primarily related to reduced taxes paid in versus  in part  due to the utilization of foreign tax credits  somewhat offset by lower net income in as of december   working capital was million compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 
in addition to factors such as capital expenditures  dividends and stock repurchases  the company s us dollar reported cash position was negatively impacted during by the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies  particularly the japanese yen 
in  cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a net debt payment of million 
the subsequent refinancing in of the company s existing credit facility  as described below  positively impacted the company s working capital in and capital expenditures  primarily for equipment  computer systems and software  office furniture and leasehold improvements  were million for the year ended december  in addition  the company anticipates capital expenditures in of approximately million to further enhance its infrastructure  including enhancements to computer systems and internet related software in order to expand the company s internet capabilities  as well as further expansion of the company s retail stores and related infrastructure in china 
on october   the company refinanced the million balance of its existing credit facility with the proceeds of a private placement of billion japanese yen of ten year senior notes the notes to the prudential insurance company of america 
the notes bear interest at an effective rate of per annum and are due october  with annual principal payments beginning october as of december   the outstanding balance on the notes was billion japanese yen  or million 
on may   the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and bank one  na for which bank of america  na acted as agent 
the proceeds may be used for working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes including repurchases of the company s outstanding shares of class a common stock 
there were no outstanding balances relating to the revolving credit facility as of december  the revolving credit facility is reduced to million on may   and is further reduced to million on may  the revolving credit facility is set to expire on may  since august  the board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding shares of class a common stock 
the repurchases are used primarily to fund the company s equity incentive plans 
during the years ended december  and  the company repurchased approximately million and million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   the company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate price of approximately million 
during each quarter of  the board of directors declared cash dividends of per share for all classes of common stock 
these quarterly cash dividends totaled approximately million and were paid during to stockholders of record in in addition  the company anticipates that the board of directors will continue to declare quarterly cash dividends in on february   the board of directors increased the dividend to be paid during the first quarter of to per share for all classes of common stock 
management believes that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund continued dividend payments 
the company had related party payables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the company had related party receivables of million and million  respectively  at those dates 
these balances are largely related to the big planet acquisition and the nu skin usa transactions completed during as well as a million loan to a significant stockholder  partly collateralized by company stock 
for a further discussion of related party transactions see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management considers the company to be sufficiently liquid to be able to meet its obligations on both a short and long term basis 
management currently believes existing cash balances together with future cash flows from operations will be adequate to fund cash needs relating to the implementation of the company s strategic plans 
the majority of the company s expenses are variable in nature and as such  a potential reduction in the level of revenue would reduce the company s cash flow needs 
however  in the event that the company s current cash balances  future cash flow from operations and current lines of credit are not sufficient to meet its obligations or strategic needs  the company would consider raising additional funds in the capital or equity markets or to restructure its current debt obligations 
additionally  the company would consider realigning its strategic plans including a reduction in capital spending and a reduction in the level of stock repurchases or dividend payments 
the sec has encouraged all public companies to aggregate all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect financial condition and liquidity as of december  to respond to this  the company has included the following table 
payments due by period for contractual obligations are as follows us dollars in thousands after total years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations nil nil nil nil operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations n a n a n a n a other long term obligations n a n a n a n a total contractual cash obligations  operating leases includes corporate office and warehouse space with two related party entities which totaled million for the year ended december  and is million of the total operating lease commitment 
the company enters into ordinary purchase  supply and consulting or other contracts as part of its ongoing operations 
as of december   there were no material unconditional purchase obligations or other long term obligations 
seasonality in addition to general economic factors  the direct selling industry is impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns 
for example  most asian markets celebrate their respective local new year in the first quarter  which generally has a negative impact on such quarter 
management believes that direct selling in japan  the united states and europe is also generally negatively impacted during the month of august  which is in the company s third quarter  when many individuals  including the company s distributors  traditionally take vacations 
distributor information the following table provides information concerning the number of active and executive distributors as of the dates indicated 
active distributors are those distributors who were resident in the countries in which the company operated and purchased products during the three months ended as of the date indicated 
an executive distributor is an active distributor who has achieved required monthly personal and group sales volumes 
as of december  as of december  as of december  active executive active executive active executive north asia      north america       southeast asia      other markets  total       quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the periods shown 
st nd rd th st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter us dollars in millions  except per share amounts revenue gross profit operating income net income net income per share basic diluted currency risk and exchange rate information a majority of the company s revenue and many of the company s expenses are recognized primarily outside of the united states except for inventory purchases which are primarily transacted in us dollars from vendors in the united states 
each subsidiary s local currency is considered the functional currency 
all revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  the company s reported revenue and earnings will be positively impacted by a weakening of the us dollar and will be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the us dollar 
in early  the yen depreciated in value relative to the us dollar 
if such relative values of the yen continue throughout  the company s reported revenue and earnings will be negatively impacted 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  the company cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on the company s future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
however  because a majority of the company s revenue is realized in local currencies and the majority of the company s cost of sales is denominated in us dollars  the company s gross profits will be positively affected by a weakening in the us dollar and will be negatively affected by strengthening in the us dollar 
the company seeks to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  through intercompany loans of foreign currency and through its japanese yen denominated debt 
the company does not use such derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company regularly monitors its foreign currency risks and periodically takes measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the company s operating results 
as of january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
the company s foreign currency derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts with major international financial institutions 
as of december   the company had million of such contracts with expiration dates from january to september all such contracts were denominated in japanese yen 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million of gains in operating income  and million in other comprehensive income related to its forward contracts 
based on the company s foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the japanese yen would not represent a material potential loss in fair value  earnings or cash flows against such contracts 
this potential loss does not consider the underlying foreign currency transaction or translation exposures of the company
