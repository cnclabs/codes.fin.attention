the unsecured credit facilities include a million day revolving credit agreement and a million five year  nonamortizing  revolving credit agreement 
a total of million was drawn under the new credit facilities  of which million prepaid the debt outstanding under the facilities and million was used to terminate the company s synthetic lease and purchase its mahwah  new jersey  manufacturing and distribution facility

at december   there were million in additional purchase liabilities remaining to be paid out 
certain obligations  such as those related to lease commitments for facility closures  will result in payments extending to the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines 
when the us dollar weakens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities principally ranging from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally us dollars and euros with maturities ranging from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points 
a hypothetical change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million and would have changed the fair value by approximately million 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
the company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements  which have fixed the base rate on a million notional amount of the million of variable rate borrowings outstanding at december  if market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged more than they did in  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps  would have increased  and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by million 
by comparison  if market interest rates had averaged less than they did during  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps  would have decreased  and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by million 
if market in terest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged more than they did in  the company s discount expense would have increased  and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by million 
by comparison  if market interest rates had averaged less than they did in  the company s discount expense would have decreased  and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments  but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements no 
and no 
the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the company s interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis through  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense 
approximately of the company s outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges 
upon adoption of the statements on january   the company recognized a gain from the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss related to the interest rate swap agreements 
a loss of million attributable to a decrease in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective  or were terminated before the contractual termination dates  or if it be came probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized gains losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss 
interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings 
based on the maturities of the company s interest rate swap agreements  interest expense for the year ending december  is expected to increase by million through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at december  the company uses yen denominated floating rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in japan 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the consolidated statements of earnings  but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in stockholders equity 
net gains losses of million  million and million attributable to the yen denominated floating rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in  and  respectively

per diluted share 
in the first quarter of  the company will perform the initial impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  the company will test for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
any impairment charge resulting from these initial impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the company has not yet determined what effect the tests will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company will perform a subsequent impairment test in the fourth quarter of and then at least annually thereafter 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  the company established  million in unsecured credit facilities in december these facilities replaced the  million secured senior credit facilities that were established in in conjunction with the acquisition of howmedica 
interest expense for is expected to be reduced by approximately million as a result of the refinancing 
as a result of changed conditions in the insurance industry  including less favorable experience factors within the orthopaedic industry  the company s cost for insurance coverage will increase substantially in the increase in insurance premiums will offset the million in interest expense savings from the december debt refinancing
