introduction the pantry  inc is the leading convenience store retailer in the southeast and is the second largest independently operated chain in the united states 
as of september   we operated  retail outlets located in ten southeastern states 
our operating strategy is to provide value to our customers by maintaining high store standards and offering a wide selection of quality products at competitive prices 
we sell general merchandise  petroleum products and other products and services targeted to appeal to consumers desire for convenience 
our fiscal operating performance was impacted by lower gasoline margins per gallon and softness in the economy and in travel and tourism 
we believe we gained market share despite these factors by enhancing our merchandise and gasoline offerings coupled with targeted promotional activities 
fiscal results also reflect higher expenses associated with increased insurance costs  closed store charges and consulting fees associated with our gasoline branding and sourcing project 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by comparable store volume gains  the savings associated with our fiscal restructuring plan and ongoing cost saving initiatives 
our management team is focused on the following initiatives enhancing our merchandise and gasoline offerings  improving our competitive position in key product categories including petroleum products  remodeling and upgrading our existing retail network and strengthening our financial position by improving overhead productivity and reducing long term debt 
the fundamental strength of our business model is our ability to assemble the optimal mix of product offerings for our customers and ongoing focus on execution 

table of contents enhancing our merchandise offering 
throughout fiscal  we continued to enhance our merchandise offering in order to provide customers with an even broader selection of competitively priced products 
in addition to offering a wide selection of brand name  high demand goods and impulse items  which include snack foods  candy  soft drinks  beer and cigarettes  we also continued to expand our fresh food offering and additional convenience items 
these included our offering of in store freshly brewed coffees  our line of private label bottled water  numerous branded quick service restaurants as well as the continued introduction of pre paid cellular and phone cards throughout our locations 
our merchandising strategy and our initiatives in this segment are aimed at ensuring that our stores are fully stocked with the products  brands and services our customers are looking for and will return to our locations to purchase 
enhancing our gasoline offering 
our efforts during fiscal were also focused on enhancing our gasoline offering 
given that gasoline sales remain the single greatest driver of traffic to our stores  our ongoing ability to offer the right selection of branded and unbranded products throughout the markets we serve remains significant 
during the year  we worked together with outside consultants to fully review the logistics of our gasoline operations and our branding strategies in key markets 
our aim was to better rationalize our offering according to consumer preferences in various markets  consolidate the brands we offer  expand our proprietary kangaroo brand where appropriate and renegotiate our agreements and partnerships with suppliers in line with the realities of current market conditions 
improving our competitive position 
given the highly competitive nature of the convenience store industry  we remained focused throughout the year on further strengthening our competitive position 
in stores  our efforts were grounded in a comprehensive repositioning program  which we began in fiscal and completed in more than of our stores by year end 
this process allowed us to thoroughly evaluate the performance of each of our stores and make necessary adjustments to better meet the demands of our customers and drive in store traffic 
our efforts included the repositioning of our merchandise offering through price adjustments  a planned increase in promotional activities  changes to in store placement and assortment and enhanced advertising of key destination categories 
similarly  in our gasoline operations  we continued our commitment to remaining intelligently competitive 
we continuously monitored and adjusted our pricing throughout the markets we serve to reflect changes in market conditions and ensure that we maintained an appropriate balance between gasoline volume and gross profit 
remodeling and upgrading our retail facilities 
see store development and acquisition activity below 
strengthening our financial position 
given economic and industry dynamics  we maintained a disciplined approach to discretionary spending in fiscal and  despite relatively weak gasoline margins  we were able to reduce long term debt by million and end fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents 
in fiscal  we anticipate reducing long term debt by approximately million 
during fiscal  we made significant progress in our drive to reduce operating costs and expense 
these savings were partially offset by increases in insurance expenses  consulting and professional fees and charges related to our program to close under performing locations 
strengthening our financial position enhances our financial flexibility and  ultimately  supports our goal to communicate value to our customers at quality  convenient retail locations 
collectively  our constant drive for operational excellence and a disciplined store development and acquisition program bolster these initiatives 
store development and acquisition activity given general economic and industry specific market conditions  in early fiscal  we adopted a fiscally conservative approach to store development and acquisition activity 
though we believe a conservative store development program continues to be fiscally prudent  this does not represent a change in our long term strategic direction and when conditions improve we plan to accelerate our store development and acquisition programs 

table of contents store development 
our fiscal store development plan and resources were directed toward improving the productivity of our retail network and reimaging and upgrading our growth oriented locations 
in fiscal  we remodeled approximately locations and upgraded approximately other locations 
in fiscal  we opened stores located in high growth areas 
starting in fiscal  we anticipate modest increases in our new store activity 
acquisition strategy 
our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring attractive convenience stores in terms of location  historical operating performance and future prospects for revenue growth and profitability 
we seek to improve the productivity and profitability of acquired stores by implementing our merchandise and gasoline programs  eliminating duplicative costs  reducing overhead and centralizing functions such as purchasing and information technology 
we believe acquiring locations with demonstrated operating results involves lower risk and is generally an economically attractive alternative to traditional site development 
we also believe a disciplined acquisition program can be constantly tailored to optimally balance our long term growth objectives with current market conditions and acquisition prices 
results of operations we use the concept of adjusted earnings  adjusted net income and adjusted income from operations in our discussions of financial results in an effort to enhance the comparability of our results for all fiscal periods presented 
generally  items adjusted from reported results are i non recurring items or amounts relating to the adoption of new accounting standards  ii amounts material enough to impact the comparability of our financial results from period to period and iii items and amounts management believes should be excluded from results of operations to provide interested parties with results reported on a like basis 
for our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september   adjusted earnings exclude i changes in the fair market value of interest rate derivatives  ii restructuring charges and iii goodwill amortization 
these adjustments are highlighted in the tables preceding our discussion of results of operations for each comparative period

we can incur debt under the senior subordinated notes if the ratio of our pro forma ebitda to fixed charges  after giving effect to such incurrence  is at least to even if we do not meet this ratio we can incur i bank credit facility acquisition debt of up to million and other debt in an amount equal to the greater of million or times our annualized revenues  ii capital leases or acquisition debt in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate of our tangible assets at time of incurrence  iii intercompany debt  iv pre existing debt  v up to million in any type of debt or vi debt for refinancing of the above described debt 
the senior subordinated notes also place conditions on the terms of asset sales or transfers and require us either to reinvest the proceeds of an asset sale or transfer  or  if we do not reinvest those proceeds  to pay down our senior credit facility or other senior debt or to offer to redeem our senior subordinated notes with any asset sale proceeds not so used 
all of the senior subordinated notes may be redeemed after october  at a redemption price that begins at and decreases to after october shareholders equity 
as of september   our shareholders equity totaled million 
the increase of million in shareholders equity is primarily attributable to fiscal net income of million and a decrease of million in accumulated other comprehensive deficit related to the fair value changes in our qualifying derivative financial instruments 
additional paid in capital is impacted by the accounting treatment applied to a leveraged buyout of the outstanding common stock of our predecessor which resulted in a debit to equity of million 
this debit had the effect  among others  of offsetting million of equity capital invested in us by our shareholders

environmental reserves of million as of september  represent estimates for future expenditures for remediation  tank removal and litigation associated with known contaminated sites as a result of releases and are based on current regulations  historical results and certain other factors 
we estimate that approximately million of our environmental obligation will be funded by state trust funds and third party insurance 
florida environmental regulations require all single walled underground storage tanks to be upgraded replaced with secondary containment by december  in order to comply with these florida regulations  we will be required to upgrade or replace underground storage tanks at approximately locations 
we anticipate that these capital expenditures will be approximately million and will begin during our fiscal the ultimate costs incurred will depend on several factors including future store closures  changes in the number of locations upgraded or replaced and changes in the costs to upgrade or replace the underground storage tanks 
other commitments 
we make various other commitments and become subject to various other contractual obligations which we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business 
management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
inflation during fiscal  wholesale gasoline fuel prices remained volatile  hitting a high of approximately per barrel in september and a low of approximately per barrel in november generally  we pass along wholesale gasoline cost changes to our customers through retail price changes 
gasoline price volatility has had an impact on total revenue  gross profit dollars and gross profit percentage 
general cpi  excluding energy  increased during fiscal and food at home  which is most indicative of our merchandise inventory  increased similarly 
while we have generally been able to pass along these price increases to our customers  we can make no assurances that continued inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross profit dollars 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for all business 
table of contents combinations initiated after june  and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting and requires all acquisitions consummated subsequent to june  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful life and instead requires an impairment only approach 
as permitted  we early adopted sfas no 
effective september   which has resulted in the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
we determined that we operate in one reporting unit based on the current reporting structure and have thus assigned goodwill at the enterprise level 
we have completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test by comparing the enterprise fair value to its carrying value and have determined that no impairment exists at the effective date of the implementation of the new standard 
fair value was measured using a valuation by an independent third party as of september  which was based on market multiples  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow methodologies 
this valuation indicated an aggregate fair value in excess of our market capitalization as of september  we believe the market capitalization is not representative of the fair value of the company because our common stock is not actively traded 
on an ongoing basis  we will perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
at least quarterly  we will evaluate to determine if an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its carrying amount and if necessary we will perform a goodwill impairment test between the annual dates 
impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  will be recognized as operating expenses 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize an estimated liability associated with the removal of our underground storage tanks 
adoption of sfas no 
is required for fiscal years beginning after june   which would be our fiscal we anticipate the adoption of sfas no 
will result in a one time cumulative effect charge of approximately million to million 
we also anticipate recording a discounted liability of million to million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

this statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those polices may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
environmental liabilities and related receivables 
we account for the cost incurred to comply with federal and state environmental regulations as follows environmental reserves reflected in the financial statements are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate sites relating to the operation of underground storage tanks 
factors considered in the estimates of the reserve are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site 
deductibles and remediation costs not covered by state trust fund programs and third party insurance arrangements  and for which the timing of payments can be reasonably estimated  are discounted using a ten percent discount rate 
reimbursement under state trust fund programs or third party insurers are recognized as receivables and a provision for uncollectible reimbursements is recorded based on historical and expected collection rates 
our historical collection experience exceeds 
all recorded reimbursements are expected to be collected within a period of twelve to eighteen months after submission of the reimbursement claim 
the adequacy of the liability and uncollectible receivable reserve is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing sites  newly identified sites and changes in governmental policy 
changes in laws and government regulation  the financial condition of the state trust funds and third party insurers and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our statement of operations and financial position 
vendor allowances and rebates 
we receive payments for vendor allowances  volume rebates and other supply arrangements in connection with various programs 
payments are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales or expenses to which the particular payment relates 
unearned payments are deferred and amortized as earned over the term of the respective agreement 
long lived assets and closed stores 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  the projected future undiscounted cash flows due to each store are compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets of that store to determine if a write down to fair value is required 
property and equipment of stores we are closing are written down to their estimated net realizable value at the time we commit to a plan to close such stores 
if applicable  we provide for future estimated rent and other exit costs associated with the store closure  net of sublease income  using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining rent payments on closed stores 
we estimate the net realizable value based on our experience in utilizing or disposing of similar assets and on estimates provided by our own and third party real estate experts 
changes in real estate markets could significantly impact the net realizable value from the sale of assets and rental or sublease income 

table of contents insurance liabilities 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation and employee medical programs 
accrued liabilities have been recorded based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred and incurred but not reported claims 
our accounting policies regarding self insurance programs include judgments and actuarial assumptions regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims  claim development patterns and claim management and settlement practices 
significant changes in actual expenditures compared to historical experience rates as a result of increased medical costs or incidence rates could significantly impact our statement of operations and financial position 
goodwill impairment 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires allocating goodwill to each reporting unit and testing for impairment using a two step approach 
based on our current reporting structure  we have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and therefore have assigned goodwill at the enterprise level 
fair value is measured using a valuation based on market multiples  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow methodologies 
the valuation required at adoption of sfas no 
indicated an aggregate fair value in excess of our carrying or book value as of september  and  therefore  we have determined that no impairment existed as of september  the goodwill impairment test is performed annually or whenever an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for future valuation  should the enterprise carrying value exceed the estimated fair market value we would have to perform additional valuations to determine if any goodwill impairment exists 
any impairment recognized will be recorded as a component of operating expenses 
changes in the long term economics of the gasoline and convenience store markets  fluctuations in capital markets and competition could impact our fair value measurements which could significantly impact our statement of operations and financial position 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock  our senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility 
any of these risk factors  or others not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition in the future 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock  our senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our operating results and financial condition are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors 
our annual and quarterly results of operations are affected by a number of factors which can adversely effect our revenue  profitability or cash flow  including without limitation competitive pressures from convenience store operators  gasoline stations and other non traditional operators located in our markets  changes in economic conditions generally and in the markets we serve  unfavorable weather conditions  political conditions in crude oil producing regions  including south america and the middle east  volatility in crude oil and wholesale petroleum costs  wholesale cost increases of tobacco products  consumer behavior  travel and tourism trends  changes in state and federal environmental and other regulations  financial leverage and debt covenants  changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities  credit facilities and trade credit  
table of contents the interests of our controlling stockholder  acts of war and terrorism and other unforeseen factors 
the convenience store industry is highly competitive and impacted by new entrants 
the industry and geographic areas in which we operate are highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in terms of the number and type of retailers offering the products and services found in our stores 
we compete with other convenience store chains  gasoline stations  supermarkets  drugstores  discount stores  club stores and mass merchants 
in recent years  several non traditional retail segments entering the gasoline retail business including supermarkets  club stores and mass merchants have impacted the convenience store industry 
these non traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the motor fuels market and their market share is expected to grow 
in some of our markets  our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry 
to remain competitive  we must constantly analyze consumer preferences  competitive offerings and competitive prices to ensure we offer a selection of products and services consumers demand at competitive prices 
we must also maintain and upgrade our customer service levels  facilities and locations to remain competitive and drive customer traffic to our stores 
major competitive factors include  among others  location  ease of access  gasoline brands  pricing  product and service selections  customer service  store appearance  cleanliness and safety 
changes in economic conditions may influence consumer preferences and spending patterns 
changes in economic conditions generally or in the southeast could adversely impact consumer spending patterns and travel and tourism in our market areas 
approximately of our stores are located in coastal  resort or tourist destinations 
historically  travel and consumer behavior in such markets is more severely impacted by weak economic conditions 
unfavorable weather conditions could adversely affect our business 
substantially all of our stores are located in the southeast region of the united states 
though the southeast is generally known for its mild weather  the region is susceptible to severe storms including hurricanes  thunderstorms  extended periods of rain  ice storms and heavy snow 
approximately of our stores are located in coastal areas and florida 
inclement weather conditions as well as severe storms in the southeast could damage our facilities or could have a significant impact on consumer behavior  travel and convenience store traffic patterns as well as our ability to operate our locations 
in addition  we typically generate higher revenues and gross margins during warmer weather months in the southeast  which fall within our third and fourth quarters 
if weather conditions are not favorable during these periods  our operating results and cash flow from operations could be adversely affected 
political conditions in oil producing regions could impact the price of wholesale petroleum costs and our operating results 
general political conditions and instability in oil producing regions particularly in the middle east and venezuela could significantly impact crude oil supplies and wholesale petroleum costs 
in addition  the supply of gasoline for our unbranded locations and our wholesale purchase costs could be adversely impacted in the event of a shortage as our gasoline contracts do not guarantee an uninterrupted  unlimited supply of gasoline 
significant increases and volatility in wholesale petroleum costs could result in significant increases in the retail price of petroleum products and in lower gasoline gross margin per gallon 
increases in the retail price of petroleum products could impact consumer demand for gasoline 
these factors could materially impact our gasoline gallon volume  gasoline gross profit and overall customer traffic 
volatility in crude oil and wholesale petroleum costs could impact our operating results 
in the past three fiscal years  our gasoline revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues and our gasoline gross profit accounted for approximately of total gross profit 
crude oil and domestic wholesale petroleum markets are marked by significant volatility 
this volatility makes it is extremely difficult to predict the impact future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition 
these factors could materially impact our gasoline gallon volume  gasoline gross profit and overall customer traffic 

table of contents wholesale cost increases of tobacco products could impact our merchandise gross profit 
sales of tobacco products have averaged approximately of our total revenue over the past three fiscal years 
significant increases in wholesale cigarettes costs and tax increase on tobacco products  as well as national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the united states  may have an adverse effect on unit demand for cigarettes domestically 
in general  we attempt to pass price increases on to our customers  however due to competitive pressures in our markets  we may not be able to do so 
these factors could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes  cigarette unit volume and revenues  merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic 
changes in consumer behavior  travel and tourism could impact our business 
in the convenience store industry  customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends  growth rates for automobile and truck traffic and trends in travel  tourism and weather 
to meet consumer demands and remain competitive  we must stock our locations with the right mix of products consumers prefer and constantly compare our assortment of products to market research data 
if we are unable to obtain and offer an appropriate mix of products  our operating results may be impacted and we may lose customers to other convenience store chains or other channels 
we are subject to state and federal environmental and other regulations 
our business is subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations including  but not limited to  environmental regulations  employment laws and regulations  regulations governing the sale of alcohol and tobacco  minimum wage requirements and other laws and regulations 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  we may  as the owner or operator of our locations  be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at these or our former locations  whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such contamination 
the failure to properly remediate such contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral 
additionally  persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at sites where they are located  whether or not such site is owned or operated by such person 
although we do not typically arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances  we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as other related costs  including governmental fines  and injuries to persons  property and natural resources 
compliance with existing and future environmental laws regulating underground storage tanks may require significant capital expenditures and the remediation costs and other costs required to clean up or treat contaminated sites could be substantial 
we pay tank fees and other taxes to state trust funds in support of future remediation obligations 
these state trust funds or other responsible third parties including insurers are expected to pay or reimburse us for remediation expenses less a deductible 
to the extent third parties do not pay for remediation as we anticipate  we will be obligated to make these payments  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
reimbursements from state trust funds will be dependent on the continued viability of these funds 
in the future  we may incur substantial expenditures for remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at existing locations or locations  which we may acquire 
we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at all of our current and former locations  that material environmental conditions not known to us do not exist  that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liability on us  or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our locations 
in addition  failure to comply with any environmental regulations or an increase in regulations could affect operating results and financial condition 
state laws regulate the sale of alcohol and tobacco products 
a violation or change of these laws could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations because state and local regulatory agencies have the power to approve  revoke  suspend or deny applications for  and renewals of  permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies 

table of contents any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage rate would result in an increase in our labor costs and such cost increase  or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  regulations are proposed which  if adopted  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on one principal supplier for the majority of our merchandise 
we purchase over of our general merchandise  including most tobacco products and grocery items  from a single wholesale grocer  mclane company  inc we have a contract with mclane until  but we may not be able to renew the contract upon expiration 
a change of suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  cost of goods  financial condition and results of operations 
our financial leverage and debt covenants impact our fiscal and financial flexibility 
we are highly leveraged  which means that the amount of our outstanding debt is large compared to the net book value of our assets  and we have substantial repayment obligations under our outstanding debt 
we will have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service  rather than for our operations or to implement our growth strategy 
as of september   we had consolidated debt including capital lease obligations of approximately million and shareholders equity of approximately million 
as of september   our availability under our senior credit facility for borrowing or issuing additional letters of credit was approximately million 
we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates because the debt under our senior credit facility is at a variable interest rate and although in the past we have on occasion entered into certain hedging instruments in an effort to manage our interest rate risk  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so  on favorable terms or at all  in the future 
our senior credit facility contains numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities such as acquiring or disposing of assets  engaging in mergers or reorganizations  making investments or capital expenditures and paying dividends 
these covenants require that we meet interest coverage  net worth and leverage tests 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility permit us and our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt  subject to limitations 
any breach of these covenants could cause a default under our debt obligations and result in our debt becoming immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the twelve month period ending september   we failed to satisfy two financial covenants required by our senior credit facility 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received a waiver from our senior credit group and executed an amendment to the senior credit facility that included  among other things  a modification to financial covenants and certain increases in the floating interest rate 
our ability to respond to changing business conditions and to secure additional financing may be restricted by these covenants  which may become more restrictive in the future 
we also may be prevented from engaging in transactions  including acquisitions that may be important to our long term growth strategy 
changes in our credit ratings or trade credit terms could adversely impact our financial condition and operating flexibility 
if the company s credit ratings are downgraded  our financial flexibility  borrowing costs  product supply costs and ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms may be affected 
furthermore  we rely on credit terms provided by our major suppliers including our major wholesaler  gasoline suppliers and other suppliers 
material changes in these credit terms could impact our operating results and financial condition 
the interests of the pantry s controlling stockholder may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders 
as a result of its stock ownership and board representation  freeman spogli is in a position to affect our corporate actions such as mergers or takeover attempts in a manner that could conflict with 
table of contents the interests of our other stockholders 
as of december   freeman spogli owned  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
freeman spogli s beneficial ownership of the pantry  including shares underlying warrants  at december  was approximately 
in addition  four of the nine members of our board of directors are representatives of freeman spogli 
because we depend on our senior management s experience and knowledge of our industry  we would be adversely affected if senior management left the pantry 
we are dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  peter j 
sodini 
mr 
sodini s employment contract terminates in september if  for any reason  our senior executives do not continue to be active in management  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior personnel as needed in the future 
in addition  we do not maintain key personnel life insurance on our senior executives and other key employees 
future sales of additional shares into the market may depress the market price of the common stock 
if our existing stockholders sell shares of common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  or if the market perceives such sales could occur  the market price of our common stock could decline 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions 
as of september   there are  shares of our common stock outstanding 
of these shares   shares are freely tradable 
 shares are held by affiliate investment funds of freeman spogli 
pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended  affiliates of the pantry can resell up to of the aggregate outstanding common stock during any three month period 
in addition  freeman spogli has registration rights allowing them to require us to register the resale of their shares 
if freeman spogli exercises its registration rights and sell shares of common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
our charter includes provisions which may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation gives our board of directors the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock  without obtaining shareholder approval 
the existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the pantry by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
furthermore  this preferred stock could be issued with other rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock  and  therefore  issuance of the preferred stock could have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue any shares of our preferred stock 
other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or hinder a change in management even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these governance provisions could affect the market price of our common stock 
we may  in the future  adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an unsolicited takeover  even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated stockholders 
these measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
acts of war and terrorism could impact our business 
acts of war and terrorism could impact general economic conditions and the supply and price of crude oil 
in addition  these events may cause damage to our retail facilities and disrupt the supply of the products and services we off in our locations 
the factors could impact our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
any of the above factors may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results  historical results or recent trends in operating results and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and  in some cases  relate to our acquisitions of related businesses 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long term debt and any future financing requirements 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on our senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility 
in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into interest rate swap arrangements  in which we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
at september   the interest rate on of our debt was fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap arrangements compared to at september  the following table presents the notional principal amount  weighted average pay rate  weighted average receive rate and weighted average years to maturity on our interest rate swap contracts interest rate swap contracts dollars in thousands september  september  notional principal amount weighted average pay rate weighted average receive rate weighted average years to maturity we have also entered into an interest rate collar arrangement covering a notional amount of million 
the interest rate collar agreement expires in february  and has a cap rate of and a floor rate of 
as of september   the fair value of our swap and collar agreements represented a liability of million 
qualitative disclosures our primary exposure relates to interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  our ability to refinance our senior subordinated notes at maturity at market rates  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  management continues to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
