item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview august technology serves microelectronics device manufacturing industries with tools that enable manufacturers to bring new products to market faster and with less cost 
as a worldwide leader in the research  design  development  manufacture  marketing  sales  distribution and service of automated micro defect inspection and metrology systems  we make it possible for microelectronic device manufacturers to more effectively meet the needs of the high technology communication  transportation  entertainment  productivity and security markets 
the flexibility of our tools has allowed us to successfully serve the semiconductor manufacturing market while concurrently providing effective solutions for high growth markets such as data storage  micro displays  optoelectronics  photonics and mems 
microelectronic devices processed through our systems can be found in consumer products such as personal computers and computer peripherals  cell phones  personal digital assistants pdas  set top boxes  electronic games  security systems  automobiles and throughout the communications infrastructure in electrical  optical and wireless networks 
we were subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in demand for our products during  and due to the cyclical nature of the microelectronic device manufacturing markets we serve 
these cycles were generally driven by changes in technology  economic conditions affecting demand for these devices and capacity requirements 
these factors and the overall downturn in the global economy caused changes in the timing of both orders and sales 
future quarterly and annual results will continue to be impacted by these cycles  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the pricing of our products and the timing and level of our research and development expenditures 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the sale of systems  spare parts and services 
system sales established products 
we require customers  excluding our distributors  that have new inspection applications to complete pre shipment authorization testing of purchased systems at our facility prior to shipment 
during this testing  the customer verifies that the system meets their specifications and authorizes shipment 
when the customer has already accepted a previous system  with the same specifications  for the same application  we do not require pre shipment authorization testing 
sales of established products are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
under this method  the total value is allocated first to undelivered elements  such as installation  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to system revenue 
system revenue is recognized once the product has shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we do not deem installation to be essential to the functionality of our systems as it does not involve altering the system s features or capabilities or the building of complex interfaces 
we have had no systems returned after shipment 
system sales new products 
revenues related to sales of systems that have not been demonstrated to meet customer specifications prior to shipment are recognized once title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  installation has occurred and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
spare parts revenue 
spare parts revenue is recognized when the parts have been shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
service revenue 
service revenues are recognized after the services are performed and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
service revenues were insignificant during the years ended december   and valuation of accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 
for the three years ended december   we have had accounts receivable write offs totaling  changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
valuation of inventory 
we review obsolescence to determine that inventory items deemed obsolete are appropriately reserved 
in making the determination  we consider future sales of related products and quantity of inventory at the balance sheet date assessed against each part s past usage rates and future expected usage rates 
for the three years ended december   we have written off inventory totaling  we have an allowance for obsolete inventory of  at december  this allowance represents our estimate of obsolete inventory as of december  changes in factors such as technology  customer demand  competitor product introductions and other matters could affect the level of inventory obsolescence in the future 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and with the cautionary statements section included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table presents the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses non recurring expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net other expense income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease in net revenues was the result of fewer shipments of our nsx systems due to a worldwide decline in capital spending by both semiconductor and microelectronic device manufacturers throughout this decline was the result of a significant slowdown in demand for the devices these manufacturers produce  which resulted in manufacturers having increased inventory  overcapacity and  consequently  lower capital spending 
net revenues derived from the sale of nsx systems represented and of net revenues in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the decrease in the number of systems shipped  which resulted in lower manufacturing utilization and increased labor and overhead costs per system sold 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increased expense dollars were due to salaries and benefits related to sales  customer service and administrative employees hired during the second half of and costs associated with opening our direct sales and service office in taiwan in these increases were partially offset by lower discretionary and compensation expenses during the second half of as a result of cost cutting initiatives that were implemented in response to the decrease in orders and shipments during this period 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increase was due to salaries and benefits related to additional engineers hired during to advance the development of our new di and yieldpilot systems  partially offset by a decrease in hiring and compensation related expenses during the second half of as a result of cost cutting initiatives that were implemented during this period 
non recurring expenses 
non recurring expenses in of  include  of employee severance costs related to reductions in work force implemented in the second and fourth quarters in response to the decrease in orders and shipments during this period  and  of expenses related to the termination of our distributor agreement in taiwan  as a result of our decision to sell direct to customers in taiwan 
non recurring expense in consists entirely of the write off of certain internal business automation software as a result of our decision to discontinue the implementation of this software 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income increased  to million in from million in the increase is due to interest income earned from investing the proceeds received from our initial public offering the ipo in june for all of  partially offset by lower overall investment balances in  due to the use of cash to fund operations and lower rates of return earned on investment balances 
income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes in was  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision for income taxes of  or an effective tax rate of  in the high effective income tax rate in  compared to the federal statutory rate of plus state and local taxes  was primarily due to the impact of federal and state general business and extraterritorial income credits and tax exempt interest income that will not be utilized until future years due to our net loss 
the low effective income tax rate in was primarily due to federal and state general business credits 
based on an assessment of our taxable earnings history and prospective future taxable income  we have determined it to be more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset will be realized in future periods 
we may be required to provide a valuation allowance for this asset in the future if we do not generate sufficient taxable income as planned 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in net revenues was due primarily to the continued growth in sales of nsx systems  which increased over the increase in sales of the nsx systems was driven by the need for semiconductor and microelectronic device manufacturers to increase yields and capacity due to strong demand for their products 
net revenues derived from sales of nsx systems represented and of net revenues in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the growth in sales of nsx systems  which have a higher gross margin than our other products  and a stronger mix of higher margin system sales within the nsx series 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increased expense dollars was primarily due to the hiring and recruiting of additional sales  field service and administrative employees to support our domestic and international growth  higher international travel costs resulting from our growth in asia and europe and increased occupancy costs related to a new facility 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increase resulted from the hiring and recruiting of additional engineers  the use of outside services and the development of product prototypes as we continued to advance new product initiatives 
non recurring expense 
non recurring expense in consists of the write off of business automation software as a result of our decision to discontinue the implementation of this software 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income in was million  compared to net interest expense of  in the net interest income in was the result of interest earned from investing the net proceeds received from our ipo in june income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was  or an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax benefit of  or an effective tax rate of  in the low effective income tax rate in  compared to the federal statutory rate of plus state and local taxes  was primarily due to the claiming of federal and state general business credits 
the low effective income tax rate in was due to a valuation allowance being recorded against a portion of our operating loss during liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  as compared to million at december  during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from increased inventories  prepaid and other current assets and decreased accounts payable  partially offset by decreased accounts receivable and an increase in customer deposits 
net cash used in investing activities was  due to purchases of held to maturity securities of million and million of additions to property and equipment and other assets  partially offset by million of proceeds from the redemption of securities held to maturity 
net cash provided by financing activities was  from the proceeds of issuances of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from increased accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid and other current assets  partially offset by increased accounts payable  accrued compensation  other accrued liabilities and accrued income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  due to purchases of held to maturity securities of million and million of additions to property and equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from the maturities of securities held to maturity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  including million of net proceeds received from the sale of  shares of common stock in the ipo  partially offset by the re payment of million of debt 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from increased accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by increased accounts payable and accrued compensation 
net cash used in investing activities was  for additions to property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily from net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock to outside investors and from million of short term borrowings 
at december  our principle sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and investments and million of available credit facilities 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business  and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and microelectronic industries 
we have no outstanding debt at december  our future commitments are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
although liquidity requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with existing cash and investment balances and our line of credit will be adequate to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next months 
impact of accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  will therefore cease upon adoption of the statement  which for us will be in january we do not expect that sfas no 
and sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however  this statement retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  this statement retains the requirement of apb no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for us in january we do not expect that sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statements certain statements contained in this form k and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
as such  they are considered forward looking statements which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events 
such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  may  could  possible  plan  project  should  will  forecast and similar words or expressions 
our forward looking statements generally relate to our growth strategies  financial results  product development and sales efforts 
one must carefully consider forward looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties  known and unknown  and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions  including  among others  those discussed below 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  but investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us on this subject in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  especially on forms k  q and k if any  in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results 
we note these factors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
as such  investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks  uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 
global economic and political environments are important to economic conditions  and long term continued risk or concerns could affect our business 
future political or related events similar or comparable to those in such as the september  terrorist attacks  or significant or long term reactions thereto  may significantly affect the willingness or ability of our customers to visit our facilities or trade shows  review our systems capabilities and or purchase or take delivery of our products  as well as our abilities to visit our customers  to perform applications studies for our customers  to sell and deliver solutions  and to service those solutions 
any decline in willingness or ability of our customers to travel and visit our facilities  or our ability to travel and visit our customers  could be a material adverse effect on our business and the financial condition and results of operations 
the microelectronic industries that we serve are highly cyclical  and are currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn 
our primary markets are the semiconductor equipment industry and the emerging microelectronics equipment industries including optoelectronics  photonics  mems or other micro machines  micro lcds  printheads  data storage  disk drives and other similar devices 
our business depends heavily upon capital expenditures by manufacturers in these industries 
the semiconductor and microelectronic industries are highly cyclical  with periods of capacity shortage and periods of excess capacity  this is historically due to sudden changes in demand for semiconductor and microelectronic devices 
in periods of excess capacity  there are often drastic changes in the timing and quantity of capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology or capacity needs by our customers  including sharp cuts in purchases of capital equipment by customers  including our products 
the timing  length and volatility of these periods are difficult to predict  resulting in pressure on our revenues  gross margin and net income 
in addition to affecting our customers  downturns also challenge our suppliers  vendors  other partners  as well as our management  sales  engineering  manufacturing  customer service and other employees who are vital to our success 
the semiconductor equipment industry as well as many of the microelectronic industries are currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn 
many industry sources have indicated that the current semiconductor industry downturn may be the steepest decline in history 
our management cannot predict when a recovery will begin or how robust it will be 
there are similarly no accurate or reliable market predictions from industry sources predicting the timing  length and strength of a recovery 
in the past  during semiconductor and microelectronic downturns  customers typically reduce or delay purchases  and or delay delivery or cancel orders 
as a result  it is imperative that we maintain an organization able to quickly and effectively align with market conditions including bringing our costs structures in line with current industry and overall market conditions 
at the same time  it is imperative that we continue to serve our existing customers  provide new and improved solutions for new and existing customers  operate effectively with our suppliers  and motivate and retain key employees 
if we are  for any reason  unable to achieve any one or more of the above objectives in an efficient  effective and timely manner  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  any delays or reductions in future purchases of capital equipment or delays or cancellations of current orders by semiconductor and microelectronic device manufacturers  for any reason  may have a material adverse effect on our business and the financial condition and results of operations 
our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for semiconductor and microelectronic test and inspection equipment and the market acceptance of our products 
we primarily target our products to address the needs of semiconductor and microelectronic manufacturers for micro defect inspection 
if for any reason the market for semiconductor and microelectronic test and inspection equipment fails to grow as we expect  we may be unable to sustain our growth 
in addition  our growth depends upon the adoption of our products by semiconductor and microelectronic manufacturers 
if  for any reason  these manufacturers do not find our products to be appropriate for their use  our future growth will be adversely affected 
our sales and operating results can fluctuate significantly from period to period which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could adversely affect sales or operating results or lead to significant variability in our operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our revenue in any particular quarter has historically come from the sale of a relatively small number of systems  the loss of any sale could have a significant negative impact 
a variety of factors could cause this variability  including the following order cancellations or delays in orders by customers  the high selling prices of our nsx series and di series  which typically result in a long sales cycle  decreases in capital spending by our customers  particularly in light of current conditions in the semiconductor and microelectronic industries  new product introductions by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  component shortages resulting in manufacturing delays  and delays in the development  introduction and manufacture of our products 
we cannot predict the impact of these and other factors on our revenues and operating results in any future period 
results of operations in any period  therefore  should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
because of this difficulty in predicting future performance  our operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
one product line accounts for a significant portion of our sales  consequently  continued market acceptance of this product line is critical to our success 
approximately of our net revenues came from the sales of our nsx series 
with the introduction of our new di series in  we expect the di line to grow as a percentage of our sales  however  we still expect that the nsx series will continue to account for at least a majority of our net revenues for the next twelve months 
continued market acceptance of this product line is critical to our success 
any decline in demand for or failure to achieve continued market acceptance of this product line or any new version of this product line  would harm our business 
the market acceptance of our new di series is critical to our growth 
semiconductor and microelectronic equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes and as a result we recently introduced the new di series 
our di series advances our product offerings into the competitive d market using our proprietary  recently introduced rapid confocal sensor technology 
if our customers do not accept and integrate our di series systems into their operations  our revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to develop and introduce successful new products and technologies in a timely manner  our business will be harmed 
the semiconductor and microelectronic capital equipment manufacturing business is a highly competitive business  and the semiconductor and microelectronic equipment and processes provided are subject to rapid technological changes 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing product line to meet customer needs and to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
we cannot assure you that our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products such as the nsx series  or our new product development efforts such as our di series incorporating our rapid confocal sensor technology  and mm advances  will be successful or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological change 
if we are unsuccessful  our expenses  revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
we continue to make and or review significant investments in research  development  and engineering in new technology and or businesses with new or complementary products  services and or technologies  and we are aware of the numerous risks associated therewith  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from day to day operational matters  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  failure to commercialize the new technology or business  and worse than expected performance of the new technology or business 
if we are unsuccessful  our revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain the necessary resources to invest in our future 
although the semiconductor and microelectronic industries are currently in a severe and prolonged downturn  we intend to prepare for the next up turn in these industries by continuing to invest in certain areas of our business 
these investments may result in the need to spend significant amounts of cash to fund increases in research  development and engineering expenses  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  such as strategic alliances or other special marketing opportunities  acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  or the development of new products  and or respond to unanticipated developments  increasing customer demands or competitive pressures 
if our cash  together with cash available under our credit facility  is insufficient to meet these cash requirements  we will need to seek alternative sources of financing to carry out our growth and operating strategies 
we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive 
if alternative sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable  we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans to the extent of available funding 
our market is highly competitive and we may lose business to larger and better financed competitors 
the semiconductor defect inspection equipment industry is highly competitive in all areas of the world 
many other domestic and foreign companies participate in the same market as our nsx and di series systems  and the industry is intensely competitive 
our current primary competitors in the market for semiconductor micro defect inspection equipment are semiconductor technologies instruments  inc  robotic vision systems  inc  toray industries  inc  and electroglas  inc 
in addition  companies such as kla tencor corporation and applied materials  inc  that are currently providing automated inspection products for the wafer manufacturing and processing market  may enter our market 
most of these competitors  as well as other potential competitors  have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer support capabilities than we have 
unless we are able to invest significant financial resources in developing products and enhancing customer support worldwide  and are able to gain customer acceptance of our products  we may not be able to compete effectively 
as we continue to diversify into the evolving and emerging microelectronic technologies and devices including optoelectronics  photonics  mems or other micro machines  flat panel display  printheads  data storage  disk drives and other similar devices  further competitors may enter our markets  or we may enter the markets of other companies 
our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical  manufacturing  managerial  financial and marketing personnel 
the labor market in which we operate is highly competitive and as a result  we may not be able to retain and recruit key personnel 
our failure to hire  retain  or adequately train key personnel could have a negative impact on our performance 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and our products under development 
to protect these rights  we have obtained two domestic patents and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate 
as of december   we also have a variety of pending patent applications in the united states and internationally 
the process of seeking intellectual property protection can be time consuming and expensive 
we cannot ensure that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications  our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us  foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights  or others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our technology 
if we do not successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees  consultants  key customers and vendors to protect our intellectual property 
other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us  and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these people 
third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation costs  licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may be unknowingly infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we do infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to those intellectual property rights or to alter our products so that they no longer infringe 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
we are responsible for any patent litigation costs 
if we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property  whether ours or that of another company  we may have to participate in legal proceedings 
these types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us  even if we eventually prevail 
if we do not prevail  we might be forced to pay significant damages  obtain licenses  modify our products or processes  stop making products or stop using processes 
our dependence on a few significant customers exposes us to operating risks 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in in  we had two customers each account for more than ten percent of our business  with one accounting for almost eighteen percent 
our customers are able to cancel orders  prior to shipment  with few or no penalties 
if a significant customer reduces orders for any reason  our revenues  operating results  and financial condition will be negatively affected 
in addition  our ability to increase our sales will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers for whom there is intense competition 
our dependence on subcontractors and sole or limited source suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis and could result in disruption of our operations 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products  and we depend on single or limited source suppliers for some of our components 
our reliance on subcontractors gives us little control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks such as inadequate capacity  late delivery  substandard quality and high costs 
if a supplier were to become unable to provide parts in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply  or manufacture the components internally 
depending on the part  the process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers generally takes between and days 
we have no written supply agreements with any of our single or limited source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders 
if we were unable to obtain these components in a timely fashion  we may not be able to meet demands for future shipments 
we believe that we would be able to find alternative solutions if supplies were unavailable from any of our sole source suppliers  including the supplier of our image processing component 
this may take time and the disruption would adversely affect our results of operations 
our dependence upon international customers and suppliers may reduce our revenues or impede our ability to supply products 
international sales have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in recent years  and we expect that the percentage of sales from international customers will continue to increase 
sales outside of north america accounted for of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in  and of our net revenues in in addition  we rely on non us suppliers for several components of the systems we sell 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and the ability to manufacture our products are subject to the risks associated with international commerce 
international sales and our relationships with suppliers may be hurt by many factors  including changes in law or policy resulting in burdensome government controls  tariffs  restrictions  embargoes or export license requirements  political or economic instability in our target international markets  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations  less favorable foreign intellectual property laws making it harder to protect our technology from appropriation by competitors  and difficulties in collecting our accounts receivable because of the geographic distance and different legal rules 
if our international sales or relationships with international suppliers are adversely affected by any of these factors  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
our operational results could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations and other global business risks 
our foreign sales are made in us dollars 
a strengthening in the dollar relative to the currencies of those countries where we do business would increase the prices of our products as stated in those currencies and hurt our sales in those countries 
if we lower our prices to reflect a change in exchange rates  our profitability in those markets will decrease 
in the past  there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the dollar and the currencies in the countries where we do business 
we have not historically tried to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do so successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we are also subject to risks associated with shipping products outside of the us including shipping delays  varying business conditions  differing business cultures  cultural diversities  and export laws  among other risks 
failure to increase our sales in asia will negatively impact our financial performance 
asia is an important region for the markets we serve 
we expect our dependence upon the asian market to increase 
in recent years  asia has experienced serious economic problems including currency devaluations  debt defaults  lack of liquidity and recessions 
our revenues depend upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  many of who have operations and customers in asia 
serious economic problems in asia would likely result in a significant decrease in the sale of equipment to the semiconductor industry 
if we are unable to increase our sales in asia  our future financial condition  revenues and operating results will be negatively affected 
in addition  we opened an office in taiwan in where we will directly sell and service our systems using our own employees 
we believe the semiconductor industry in taiwan and surrounding countries have significant sales potential thus justifying our decision  however should our predictions be incorrect  our future financial condition  revenues and operating results will be negatively affected 
although we believe that the opening of the office will provide us with more control over our affairs and a direct sales and service force dedicated to our products  the opening of the office required a lease of a facility  the hiring of employees  the formation of a limited liability entity and opening of a taiwan branch and other actions all of which may increase our exposure 
we will rely upon distributors for a significant portion of our future sales  and a disruption in our relationships with these distributors could have a negative impact on our international sales 
a substantial portion of our sales have been made through independent distributors 
we expect that sales through independent distributors will represent a material portion of our sales for the next several years 
in particular  almost all of our sales in asia  japan  and europe were made through independent distributors 
in  sales to our exclusive distributor in asia excluding japan and taiwan  since the opening of our direct sales and service office in accounted for of our net revenues  sales to our exclusive distributor in japan accounted for of our net revenues and sales to our distributors in europe accounted for of our net revenues 
the activities of these distributors are not within our control 
although we believe that we maintain good relations with our independent distributors  the relationships may nevertheless deteriorate in the future 
a reduction in the sales or service efforts or financial viability of any of our independent distributors  or a termination of our relationships with them  could harm our sales  our financial results and our ability to support our customers 
any acquisitions we may make could disrupt and harm our business 
as of the date of this filing on form k  we do not have any specific plans or agreements to make any specific material acquisitions  we plan to pursue acquisitions of related businesses 
our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business  diversion of our management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
if we are successful in pursuing acquisitions  we may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our shareholders 
if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete 
the process of reviewing and acquiring related businesses involve numerous risks  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
should we successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if a semiconductor or microelectronic manufacturer is loyal to another semiconductor or microelectronic equipment supplier  we may be unable to sell our products to that potential customer  and our sales and market share could suffer as a result 
we believe that once a semiconductor or microelectronic device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production line application  the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment  for the life of the application 
once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line  a semiconductor device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment 
accordingly  unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems  it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application
