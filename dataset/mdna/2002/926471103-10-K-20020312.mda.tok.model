overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and marketing of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections 
since our inception on may  as a wholly owned subsidiary of sepracor inc  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to establishing our business and conducting research and development activities related to our proprietary product candidates  including anidulafungin and dalbavancin  as well as collaborative product candidates 
since  we have been operating as an independent company and on august   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an initial public offering and on september   the underwriters exercised an over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
we received total net proceeds from the initial public offering and the over allotment of approximately million 
since we began our operations in may  we have not generated any revenues from product sales 
our lead product candidate  anidulafungin  is in phase iii clinical trials and our second product candidate  dalbavancin  is in phase ii clinical trials 
we also have several lead compounds in preclinical studies and in june  pharmacia corporation started clinical development of one of the compounds in our oxazolidinone program for which we have received a milestone payment 
our revenues in the near term are expected to consist primarily of collaborative research payments  license fees and milestone payments to be received from our collaborators 
certain of these payments are dependent on achievement of certain milestones 
if our development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products  we will generate revenues from sales of our products and from receipt of royalties on sales of licensed products 
our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in licensing existing product candidates  research and development of new product candidates and in connection with our collaboration agreements  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect licensing costs to increase as certain milestones are achieved and our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
we also expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel and continue to expand our research and development operations 
in addition  we expect to incur sales and marketing expenses in the future when we establish our sales and marketing organization 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses  which may increase  for the foreseeable future  including at least through december we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible

as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we also have federal research credit carryforwards of million 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change in ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception through  we funded our operations principally with the proceeds of million from a series of six preferred stock offerings over the period through in addition  on august   we sold million shares of our common stock at per share in an initial public offering 
on september   the underwriters executed an overallotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
we received total net proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering and the overallotment after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses 
the net proceeds have been invested in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  all of our preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock 
as of december   we have also received million in payments for collaborative research  contract services and milestone payments  as well as license fees from our collaborative partners  including sepracor 
of these payments  million constitutes deferred revenue as of december  in addition we have a million term loan agreement with a commercial bank 
this loan bears interest at a rate of prime plus and is payable in equal quarterly installments of  with the balance due on december  the net proceeds of this loan were used to repay sepracor for leasehold improvements to our facilities and for general corporate purposes

in october  the loan agreement was amended to include a four year equipment note for million that we are able to draw down on through june  for specified purposes 
the loan bears interest at the prime rate unless we exercise an option to have the interest on all or any portion of the principal amount based on the libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the interest on the loan is payable in quarterly installments commencing on march  the principal of the note is payable in equal installments beginning on march  with the final payment due on december  as of december   there was an outstanding note balance of million

we expect to have negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development and general and administrative expenses  including expenses related to additions to personnel and production and commercialization efforts 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing markets for our products  payments received or made under collaborative agreements  continued research and development of our product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new products or compounds  the status of competitive products and the availability of other financing 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt repayments and capital equipment requirements for approximately two years 
except for the term loan and equipment loan  we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot guarantee that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates or lead compounds that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize 
any future funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues as they are earned 
revenue from license fees and contract services are recognized over the initial license or contract service term as the related work is performed  which generally is on a straight line basis 
nonrefundable milestone payments received are recognized when they are earned as specified in the related collaboration agreements 
collaborative research and development payments are recognized as the related work is performed 
valuation allowance we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting and standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment upon initial adoption of the statement and on an annual basis going forward 
the amortization of goodwill will cease upon adoption of sfas the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  versicor is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year we believe that the adoption of these standards will have no impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
and apb  however  this statement retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as our term loan and equipment loan with a commercial bank 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
however  due to the conservative and short term nature of these investments  such exposure is limited 
borrowings under our term loan and equipment loan are also exposed to interest rate risk as they are subject to interest rates based on the bank s base rate or libor 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate marketable securities average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the short term maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our debt obligations approximates the principal amounts due based on the interest rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the years presented
