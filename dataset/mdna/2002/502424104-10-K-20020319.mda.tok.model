following the acquisition we changed emergent government services group s name to l communications analytics 
excludes additional purchase price  not to exceed million  which is contingent upon the financial performance of sy for the year ended december  and the years ending december  and on january   we agreed to acquire aircraft integration systems ais  a division of raytheon company  for billion in cash 
the acquisition was completed on march   and was financed using cash on hand  borrowings under our senior credit facilities and a million senior subordinated bridge loan 
we expect to offer and sell approximately billion of debt and equity securities during the first half of  depending on capital market conditions  and use the proceeds from those offerings to repay the million senior subordinated bridge loan and the borrowings made under the senior credit facilities 
on january   we agreed to acquire the detection systems business of perkinelmer for million in cash 
the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions  including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
we expect to complete this acquisition during the second quarter of additionally  we purchased other businesses during  and  which individually and in the aggregate were not material to our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the year acquired 
all of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase business combinations and are included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective effective dates 
on may   we sold a interest in aviation communications and surveillance systems llc acss which comprises our tcas business to thales avionics  a wholly owned subsidiary of thales formerly thomson csf  for million of cash 
we continue to consolidate the financial statements of acss 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and joint venture transactions  but we have not entered into any other agreements with respect to any material transactions at this time 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to contract estimates of sales and estimated costs to complete contracts in process  estimates of market values for inventories reported at lower of cost or market  estimates of pension and postretirement benefit obligations  recoverability of recorded amounts of fixed assets and goodwill  income taxes  including the valuations of deferred tax assets  litigation and environmental obligations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition on contracts and contract estimates 
the substantial majority of our direct and indirect sales to the us government and certain of our sales to foreign governments and commercial customers are made pursuant to written contractual arrangements or contracts to design  develop  manufacture and or modify complex products  and to the specifications of the buyers customers or to provide services related to the performance of such contracts 
these contracts are within the scope of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  and sales and profits on them are recognized using percentage of completion methods of accounting 
sales and profits on fixed price production contracts whose units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their selling prices the units of delivery method 
sales and profits on other fixed price contracts are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract the cost to cost method 
sales and fees on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured 
under the percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance which can exceed one year 
the impact of revisions in profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident 
the revisions in contract estimates  if significant  can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows  as well as our valuations of contracts in process 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires estimates of the contract value or total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s scope of work and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  including million for net operating loss carryforwards and million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods 
deferred taxes are determined separately for each of our tax paying entities in each tax jurisdiction 
future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law 
based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income  we believe that we will realize our recorded deferred tax assets 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
such changes  if significant  could have a material impact in our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations for the periods presented are impacted significantly by our acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisitions 
the tables below provide our selected income statement data for the years ended december   and segment operating data year ended december  in millions sales secure communication systems  specialized products   total    operating income secure communication systems specialized products operating income depreciation and amortization expenses included in operating income secure communication systems specialized products total ebitda secure communication systems specialized products total sales are after intersegment eliminations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
ebitda is defined as operating income plus depreciation expense and amortization expense excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs 
ebitda is not a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
ebitda is presented as additional information because we believe it to be a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements 
ebitda as we defined it may differ from similarly named measures used by other entities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales increased million to  million in compared with sales grew million in the secure communication systems segment and million in the specialized products segment 
operating income increased million to million in compared with operating income as a percentage of sales operating margin remained unchanged at 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million to million in  reflecting increased goodwill amortization associated with our acquisitions and additional depreciation related to our capital expenditures and acquired businesses 
our ebitda for increased million to million 
ebitda as a percentage of sales ebitda margin was in compared with in basic earnings per share eps grew to in and diluted eps grew to in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased in  primarily because of the sale of our common stock in april  and the dilutive effect of our convertible notes we sold in the fourth quarter of see liquidity and capital resources section below 
sales within our secure communication systems segment increased million or to  million in compared with operating income increased million to million in operating margin improved to from 
the increase in sales was principally attributed to the coleman research  mpri and eer acquired businesses and internal growth in our secure secure data links  secure telephone equipment  airport security systems  prime wave fixed wireless access products and training  teaching and logistic services 
the increase in operating margin was principally attributable to benefits from increased volumes  cost reductions and improved operating efficiencies on sales of secure telephone equipment and airport security systems 
additionally  the operating margins for our training and simulation businesses continued to improve because of reductions in overhead costs  as well as other contract costs related to favorable performance on the avcatt contract  arising from engineering design changes  material sourcing changes and unit price reductions on several parts in the contract bill of materials that occurred during these operating margin improvements were substantially offset by negative margins and increased expenditures associated with our prime wave business 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin improved to from in sales within our specialized products segment increased million or to  million in compared with operating income decreased million in to million 
operating margin decreased to from 
the increase in sales was principally attributable to internal growth in aviation products  microwave components and acoustic undersea warfare products and to the kdi acquired business 
these increases in sales were partially offset by decreases in sales of telemetry and space products  naval power equipment and displays 
we expect sales of our telemetry and space products for to remain essentially unchanged as compared to  due to continued softness in the space and broadband commercial communications market 
the decline in operating margin was principally attributable to increased costs related to unfavorable performance on certain contracts and lower production and shipment levels for naval power equipment and lower operating margins on telemetry and space products arising from reduced sales volumes 
we had higher operating margins on aviation products and microwave components related to increased sales volumes 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin decreased to from in interest expense decreased million to million in because of lower interest rates  changes in the components and levels of our debt  and savings of million from the interest rate swap agreements we entered into in july and november the interest rate swap agreements exchange the fixed interest rate of on our million senior subordinated notes due and the fixed interest rate of on our million senior subordinated notes due to variable interest rates determined using the six month libor rate see liquidity and capital resources section below

our ebitda for increased million to million 
ebitda margin increased to in from in eps grew to in and diluted eps grew to in basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased in  and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased in  primarily because of common stock issued for exercises of employee stock options 
sales within our secure communication systems segment increased million to million in compared with operating income increased million to million in operating margin improved to from 
we attribute the increase in sales principally to the acquisitions of link training and simulation and mpri and increased sales of secure telephone equipment  wideband secure data link programs  communication software support services and airport security systems 
the increase in operating margin was principally attributable to improved margins on military communication systems and high data rate communication systems 
these margin improvements arose from cost reductions and improved operating efficiencies 
additionally  during a larger percentage of our sales were generated from fixed price contracts which generally have higher margins than sales generated from cost reimbursable contracts 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin improved to from in sales within our specialized products segment increased million to  million in compared with operating income increased million to million in operating margin improved to from 
we attribute this increase in sales principally to the acquisitions of tcas and space and navigation systems and volume increases on acoustic undersea warfare products  aviation recorders  and display products 
these increases in sales were partially offset by decreased shipments of naval power equipment in compared with principally due to the slippage of certain sales into which were previously anticipated to occur in sales of our telemetry products were essentially unchanged in compared with due to continued softness in the space and broadband commercial communications markets 
we attribute our increase in operating margin principally to improved margins on avionics and ocean products 
these margin improvements arose from sales volume increases  cost reductions and the higher margins from the tcas business 
lower margins on our naval power equipment due to less shipments and on our telemetry products and microwave components due to changes in product sales mix partially offset these operating margin improvements 
ebitda increased million to million in and ebitda margin improved to from in interest expense increased million to million in principally because of the higher average outstanding debt during interest and other income decreased million to million 
interest and other income for includes a net pre tax gain of million per diluted share  consisting of an after tax gain of million from the sale of our interests in certain businesses and an after tax charge of million on the write down in the carrying value of certain investments and intangible assets 
excluding the net gain  diluted eps was  an increase of in compared with the income tax provision for is based on an effective income tax rate for of which declined slightly from the effective tax rate of for liquidity and capital resources balance sheet during  contracts in process increased million to million at december  the increase included million related to acquired businesses and million principally from o increases of million in unbilled contract receivables principally arising from an increase in programs in production phases  during which unbilled costs and profits generally exceed progress payments and advances received from the customers until contract shipments are completed  o increases of million in inventories  including inventories of our prime wave business  naval power equipment products and on certain other programs and products  and o decreases of million in billed receivables due to improved collections on certain programs  partially offset by increases at our prime wave business 
included in contracts in process at december   are billed receivables of million and inventories of million related to our prime wave business 
at december   we had million of billed receivables and million of inventories related to our prime wave business 
the increases in property  plant and equipment  intangibles  and accrued employment costs during were principally related to acquired businesses 
the decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were principally related to the timing of payments to vendors partially offset by balances of acquired businesses 
the increase in other current liabilities is primarily attributable to balances of acquired businesses and an accrual of million related to the remaining outstanding common stock of spar at december   that we acquired and paid for in january  and was partially offset by a decline in estimated contract costs in excess of billings to complete contracts in process 
the decrease in other liabilities is in part related to the issuance of common stock in april to satisfy our million obligation for the additional purchase price for the ilex acquisition completed in the decrease is also related to a reclassification of the current portion of estimated costs in excess of billings to complete contracts in process to other current liabilities 
the decrease in accrued interest was due to the effect of lower interest rates  as well as interest savings of million from the interest rate swap agreements we entered into in july and november  partially offset by an increase in accrued interest due to higher outstanding debt balances at december   attributable to our sale of the codes in the fourth quarter of the quarterly cash interest payments on our senior subordinated notes and convertible notes in were million in the first quarter and third quarter  million in the second quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
our cash interest payments may be adjusted in future years due to the interest rate swap agreements we entered into on our million senior subordinated notes due and our million senior subordinated notes due and changes in the amount of our outstanding debt 
statement of cash flows the table below provides our cash flow statement data for the years presented 
year ended december  in millions net cash from operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash from financing activities operating activities during  we generated million of cash from our operating activities  an increase of million from the million generated during earnings adjusted for non cash items and deferred income taxes increased million to million in from million in during  our working capital and operating assets and liabilities increased million compared with an increase of million in in  we used cash for increases in inventories  receivables and negative operating margins related to our prime wave business and naval power equipment products  as well as for incurred contract costs in excess of billings for the continued effort on the avcatt contract 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a settlement of certain items related to a services agreement and lower income tax payments related to an increase in tax deductions for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting amounts for inventoried costs  income recognition on contracts in process  and long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles 
we expect the amount of our deferred income tax provision for  excluding any additional income tax benefits arising from the acquisition of ais  to be consistent with that for during  we generated million of cash from our operating activities  an increase of million from the million generated during earnings adjusted for non cash items and deferred taxes increased million to million in from million in during  our working capital and operating assets and liabilities increased million compared with an increase of million in our cash flows from operating activities during include uses of cash relating to performance on certain contracts in process including the avcatt contract that were assumed in the tdts acquisition for which the estimated costs exceed the estimated billings to complete these contracts 
investing activities in  we invested million to acquire businesses  compared with million in and million in we make capital expenditures for the improvement of manufacturing facilities and equipment 
we expect that our capital expenditures for the year ending december  will be between million and million  including aircraft integration systems  compared with million for the year ended december  the anticipated increase is principally due to capital expenditures for our acquired businesses 
dispositions of property  plant and equipment for includes net proceeds of million related to a facility located in hauppauge  ny which we sold and leased back in december on may   we sold a interest in acss to thales avionics for million in cash 
in  we sold our interests in two businesses for net cash proceeds of million  which are included in other investing activities 
on january   we agreed to acquire ais for billion in cash plus acquisition costs 
the acquisition was completed on march  the acquisition was financed using cash on hand  borrowings under our senior credit facilities and a million senior subordinated bridge loan 
we expect to offer and sell approximately billion of debt and equity securities during the first half of  depending on capital market conditions  and use the proceeds from those offerings to repay the million senior subordinated bridge loan and the borrowings made under the senior credit facilities 
financing activities debt 
in may  we restructured our senior credit facilities 
at december   the senior credit facilities were comprised of a million five year revolving credit facility maturing on may  and a million day revolving facility maturing on may  under which at the maturity date we may  at our request and subject to approval of the lenders  extend the maturity date  in whole or in part  for an additional day period  or at our election  convert the outstanding principal amount thereunder into a term loan which would be repayable in a single payment two years from the conversion date 
additionally  the senior credit facilities provided us the ability to increase  on an uncommitted basis  the amount of either the five year revolving credit facility or the day revolving credit facility up to an additional million in the aggregate 
at december   available borrowings under our senior credit facilities were million  after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities at december  on february   the lenders approved a million increase in the amount of our senior credit facilities 
the five year revolving credit facility increased by million to million 
the day revolving credit facility increased by million to million 
additionally  the maturity date of the million day revolving credit facility was extended to february  on march   we borrowed million under a senior subordinated bridge loan facility bridge loan facility to finance a portion of the purchase price of ais and related expenses as discussed above 
the bridge loan facility is subordinated in right of payment to all of l communications existing and future senior debt and ranks pari passu with our other senior subordinated indebtedness and related guarantees discussed below 
borrowings under the bridge loan facility bear interest through march   at our option  at either the one month or three month libor rate plus a spread equal to basis points 
the bridge loan facility matures on may   but if the loans under the facility are not repaid by march   each lender s loan will be automatically converted into an exchange note with terms substantially similar to those of our other senior subordinated indebtedness discussed below  and will bear interest at a fixed rate equal to the yield to maturity on our highest yielding existing subordinated indebtedness at the time of exchange plus basis points 
subject to the exceptions set forth in the bridge loan facility  we are required to prepay the bridge loan facility with the net cash proceeds from o any debt offerings by l holdings or its subsidiaries  including l communications  o issuance of any equity interests in l holdings or l communications  o incurrence of any other indebtedness of l holdings or any of its subsidiaries  including l communications other than under the senior credit facilities and certain permitted indebtedness  and o any sale of assets or stock of any subsidiaries of l communications 
in the fourth quarter of  l holdings sold million of senior subordinated convertible contingent debt securities due codes 
the net proceeds from this offering amounted to approximately million after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
interest is payable semi annually on march and september of each year commencing march  the codes are convertible into l holdings common stock at a conversion price of per share  shares under any of the following circumstances during any conversion period defined below if the closing sales price of the common stock of l holdings is more than of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the first day of the respective conversion period  during the five business day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading prices for the codes was less than of the conversion value  if the credit ratings assigned to the codes by either moody s or standard poor s are below certain specified ratings  if they have been called for redemption by us  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions 
a conversion period is the period from and including the thirtieth trading day in a fiscal quarter to  but not including  the thirtieth trading day of the immediately following fiscal quarter 
there are four conversion periods in each fiscal year 
additionally  holders of the codes have a right to receive contingent interest payments  not to exceed a per annum rate of of the outstanding principal amount of the codes  which will be paid on the codes during any six month period following a six month period in which the average trading price of the codes is above of the principal amount of the codes 
the contingent interest payment provision as well as the ability of the holders of the codes to exercise the conversion features as a result of changes in the credit ratings assigned to the codes have been accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in the fourth quarter of  l holdings sold million of convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes 
the net proceeds from this offering amounted to million after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses  and were used to repay revolver borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
the convertible notes may be converted at any time into l holdings common stock at a conversion price of per share  shares 
in april  may and december  l communications sold million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  and million of senior subordinated notes due collectively  the senior subordinated notes  whose aggregate net proceeds amounted to million after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in november  we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our million of senior subordinated notes due these swap agreements exchange our fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate on the entire principal amount 
under these swap agreements  we will pay or receive the difference between the fixed interest rate of on the senior subordinated notes and a variable interest rate  set in arrears  determined two business days prior to the interest payment date of the related senior subordinated notes equal to the six month libor rate plus an average of basis points 
in july  we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our million of senior subordinated notes due these swap agreements exchange our fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate on the entire principal amount 
under these swap agreements  we will pay or receive the difference between the fixed interest rate of on the senior subordinated notes and a variable interest rate  set in arrears  determined two business days prior to the interest payment date of the related senior subordinated notes equal to the six month libor rate plus an average of basis points 
the difference to be paid or received on these swap agreements is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 
the senior credit facilities  bridge loan facility  senior subordinated notes  convertible notes and codes agreements contain financial covenants and other restrictive covenants which remain in effect so long as we owe any amount or any commitment to lend exists thereunder 
as of december   we were in compliance with those covenants at all times 
the borrowings under the senior credit facilities are guaranteed by l holdings and by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of l communications on a senior basis 
the payments of principal and premium  if any  and interest on the senior subordinated notes and bridge loan facility are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by all of l communications restricted subsidiaries other than its foreign subsidiaries 
the guarantees of the senior subordinated notes and bridge loan facility are junior to the guarantees of the senior credit facilities and rank pari passu with each other and the guarantees of the convertible notes and the codes 
the convertible notes and codes are unconditionally guaranteed  on an unsecured senior subordinated basis  jointly and severally  by l communications and substantially all of its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
these guarantees rank junior to the guarantees of the senior credit facilities and rank pari passu with each other and the guarantees of the senior subordinated notes and bridge loan facility

on may   we sold million shares of l holdings common stock in a public offering for per share 
in addition  as part of the transaction  other selling stockholders including affiliates of lehman brothers inc sold million secondary shares 
upon closing  we received net proceeds of million  which we used to repay borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities  pay for the kdi and eer acquisitions and to increase cash and cash equivalents 
on february   we sold million shares of l holdings common stock in a public offering for per share which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  as part of the same transaction  million shares of l holdings common stock were sold by lehman brothers capital partners iii  lp and its affiliates the lehman partnership and lockheed martin in a secondary public offering 
in october  lockheed martin sold its remaining l holdings common stock 
in december  the lehman partnership distributed approximately million shares of its shares of common stock of l holdings to its partners 
on december   the lehman partnership owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of l holdings 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that our cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the senior credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  commitments  research and development expenditures  contingent purchase prices  program and other discretionary investments  and interest payments for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels  or that currently anticipated improvements will be achieved 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt  we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
our ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness  to make necessary capital expenditures and to make discretionary investments 
derivative financial instruments included in our derivative financial instruments are interest rate swap agreements  caps  floors  foreign currency forward contracts and the embedded derivatives related to the issuance of our codes 
all of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
embedded derivatives 
the contingent interest payment and contingent conversion features of the codes are embedded derivatives which were bifurcated from the codes  and a portion of the net proceeds received from the codes equal to their aggregate fair value of million  which was ascribed to the embedded derivatives as required by sfas no 
the subsequent changes in the fair values of the embedded derivatives are recorded in the statement of operations 
their fair values at december  were million 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates include borrowings under the senior credit facilities and our purchased interest rate cap contracts  written interest rate floor contracts and interest rate swap agreements  all of which are denominated in us dollars 
the interest rates on the senior subordinated notes  convertible notes and codes are fixed rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates 
to mitigate risks associated with changing interest rates on borrowings under the senior credit facilities that bear interest at variable rates we entered into interest rate cap and floor contracts 
the interest rate cap contract provides protection against increases in interest rates on borrowings to the extent o those borrowings are less than or equal to the notional amount of the cap contract  and o the interest rate paid on the borrowings rises above the sum of the cap reference rate plus our applicable borrowing spread 
however  the written interest rate floor limits our ability to enjoy decreases in interest rates on our borrowings to the extent o those borrowings are less than or equal to the notional amount of the floor contract  and o the interest rate paid on those borrowings falls below the sum of the floor reference rate plus our applicable borrowing spread 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements on million of our senior subordinated notes to convert their fixed interest rates to variable rates and to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment 
these swap agreements are described above 
for every basis point that the six month libor interest rate is greater than  we will incur an additional  of interest expense above the fixed interest rate on million of senior subordinated notes calculated on a per annum basis until maturity 
for every basis point that the six month libor interest rate is greater than  we will incur an additional  of interest expense above the fixed interest rate on million of senior subordinated notes calculated on a per annum basis until maturity 
conversely  for every basis point that the six month libor interest rate is less than  we will recognize  of interest income on million of senior subordinated notes calculated on a per annum basis until maturity 
for every basis point that the six month libor interest rate is less than  we will recognize  of interest income on million of senior subordinated notes calculated on a per annum basis until maturity

we attempt to manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into interest rate agreements only with major financial institutions that are expected to perform fully under the terms of such agreements 
cash payments between us and the counterparties are made at the end of each quarter on the caps and floors and on the interest payment dates of the senior subordinated notes on the interest rate swap agreements 
such payments are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
additional data on our debt obligations  our applicable borrowing spreads included in the interest rates we pay on borrowings under the senior credit facilities and interest rate agreements are provided in notes and to our consolidated financial statements

we conduct some of our operations outside the us in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  some of our us operations have contracts with foreign customers denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the risk associated with certain of these contracts denominated in foreign currency we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and the fair value of these contracts was million 
we account for these contracts as cash flow hedges

our investments in common equities are subject to equity price risk 
the fair values of the company s investments are based on quoted market prices  as available  and on historical cost for investments which it is not practicable to estimate fair value 
both the carrying values and estimated fair values of such instruments amounted to million at the end of backlog and orders we define funded backlog as the value of contract awards received from the us government  which the us government has appropriated funds  plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the us government which have yet to be recognized as sales 
our funded backlog as of december  was  million and as of december  was  million 
we expect to record as sales approximately of our december  funded backlog during however  there can be no assurance that our funded backlog will become sales in any particular period  if at all 
our funded orders were  million for   million for and  million for our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contract awards including those pertaining to multi year  cost plus reimbursable contracts  which are generally funded on an annual basis 
funded backlog also excludes the sales value of unexercised contract options that may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the sales value of purchase orders that may be issued under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements 
research and development company sponsored research and development costs including bid and proposal costs were million for  million for and million for customer funded research and development costs were million for  million for and million for contingencies we are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the us government and to a lesser degree  under foreign government contracts  some of which are funded by the us government 
all such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements  and  periodically  agencies of the us government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements 
under government procurement regulations  an indictment by a federal grand jury could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts 
a conviction could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term 
additionally  in the event that us government expenditures for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide are reduced  and not offset by greater commercial sales or other new programs or products  or acquisitions  there may be a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us 
we continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws 
while it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws  based upon available internal and external assessments  with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware  we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries  if any  there are no environmental loss contingencies that  individually or in the aggregate  would be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
also  we have been periodically subject to litigation  claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business 
we accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
with respect to those investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments of which we are aware  we are of the opinion that the probability is remote that  after taking into account certain provisions that have been made with respect to these matters  the ultimate resolution of any such investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recently issued and proposed accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
sfas no 
revises the standards for accounting for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and indefinite lived identifiable intangible assets shall no longer be amortized  but be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that the amortization period of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives be no longer limited to forty years 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective beginning january   with full implementation of the impairment measurement provisions completed by december  under sfas no 
 we will not amortize goodwill  but will be required to amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives 
our goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  was million 
based on a preliminary internal assessment  we do not believe that the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulting from the adoption of the transitional impairment provisions of sfas no 
will be material 
in august of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement does not apply to obligations that arise solely from a plan to dispose of a long lived asset 
sfas no 
requires that estimated asset retirement costs be measured at their fair values and recognized as assets and depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
similarly  liabilities for the present value of asset retirement obligations are to be recognized and accreted as interest expense each year to their estimated future value until the asset is retired 
these provisions will be applied to existing asset retirement obligations as of the adoption date as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal years beginning january  sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in october of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb no 
 for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
expands the scope of accounting for disposals to include all components of an entity  including reportable segments and operating segments  reporting units  subsidiaries and certain asset groups 
it requires the gain or loss on disposal to be measured as the difference between the fair value less the costs to sell and the carrying value of the component  and such gain or loss cannot include the estimated future operating losses of the component  which were included in the gain or loss determination under apb no 
sfas no 
also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal years beginning january   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
inflation the effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant 
although a majority of our sales are made under long term contracts  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods 
in addition  some contracts provide for price adjustments through escalation clauses 
forward looking statements certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations  cash flows  financial position  economic performance  and financial condition  including in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  including projections of orders  sales  operating margins  earnings  cash flow  research and development costs  working capital  capital expenditures and other projections  they are subject to several risks and uncertainties  and therefore  we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved 
such statements will also be influenced by factors such as o our dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry including changing priorities or reductions in the us government defense budget  o our reliance on contracts with a limited number of agencies of  or contractors to  the us government and the possibility of termination of government contracts by unilateral government action or for failure to perform  o our ability to obtain future government contracts on a timely basis  o the availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our products and services  o our significant amount of debt and the restrictions contained in our debt agreements  o collective bargaining agreements and labor disputes  o economic conditions  competitive environment  international business and political conditions  timing of international awards and contracts  o our extensive use of fixed price contracts as compared to cost reimbursable contracts  o our ability to identify future acquisition candidates or to integrate acquired operations  o the rapid change of technology and high level of competition in the communication equipment industry  o our introduction of new products into commercial markets or our investments in commercial products or companies  o pension  environmental or legal matters or proceedings and various other market  competition and industry factors  many of which are beyond our control  and o the fair values of the assets including goodwill and other intangibles of our businesses which can be impaired or reduced by the other factors discussed above 
readers of this document are cautioned that our forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results or developments may differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
as for the forward looking statements that relate to future financial results and other projections  actual results will be different due to the inherent uncertainties of estimates  forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than projected
