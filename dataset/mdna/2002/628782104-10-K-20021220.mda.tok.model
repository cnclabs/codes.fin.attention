foreign currency foreign subsidiaries account for approximately of net revenues  of assets and of total liabilities as of september  in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries are translated from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses  which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within the statement of operations 
if the company disposes of subsidiaries  then any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recorded into the statement of operations 
if the company determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within the statement of operations 
based on an assessment of the factors discussed above  the company considers the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of its foreign subsidiaries

during the fiscal years of and  translation gains losses of  and  respectively  were included under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
had the company determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these gains losses would have increased reduced net income for each of the periods presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the euro and the united kingdom pound sterling 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if a change in the functional currency of a foreign subsidiary has occurred at any point in time  then the company would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in the statement of operations
