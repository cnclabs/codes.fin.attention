management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based on mapinfo s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management evaluates these estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
mapinfo bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time 
the basis for carrying values of assets and liabilities are determined from these estimates when they are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of mapinfo s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  an additional allowance may be recognized 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  and sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
in general  revenue related to postcontract customer support pcs is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from customer training  support and other services is recognized upon completion of the service performed 
mapinfo writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over three to seven years 
the company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment would be based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
the company will test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and goodwill will be written down if it is determined that the asset has been impaired 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mapinfo holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus 
the company records an investment impairment charge when an investment has experienced a decline in value that the company believes is not temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
this may require an impairment charge in the future 
the company has established a valuation allowance to reserve a portion of the net deferred tax assets representing foreign tax credit carryforwards 
there is no valuation allowance recorded against the company s remaining net deferred tax assets as the company believes it is more likely than not that all remaining future tax benefits will be realized against future taxable income 
however  the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income are reduced

outlook issues and risks in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following issues and risks  among others  should be considered in evaluating mapinfo s outlook and future 
effect of reduced demand and uncertainties in the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing consolidation of industry participants 
as a result  the company s operating results could become increasingly dependent on a smaller number of telecommunication customers 
also  recent declines in capital spending by telecommunications companies may result in a lengthening of customers decision cycles and a reduction in orders 
revenues from telecommunication customers accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal a significant reduction in orders from the telecommunication industry could have a material adverse effect on mapinfo s operating results and financial condition 
effects of economic slowdown 
the stock market decline and broad economic slowdown has affected the demand for software products and related services  lengthened sales cycles and caused decreased technology spending for many of the company s customers and potential customers 
these events adversely impacted the company s revenues in and in  particularly in the united states  and could have a material effect on the company in the future  including without limitation  on the company s future revenues and earnings 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risks associated with cost reduction measures 
during the fiscal year  the company restructured its operations  including decreasing headcount by approximately ninety employees 
the restructuring could have an adverse impact on the company s business  including its ability to attract and retain customers or employees  and the timing of release of new products and services 
the company cannot provide any assurance that restructuring will achieve the desired financial benefits  nor can the company provide any assurance that the reduction in headcount will not have an adverse impact on its business or future operating results 
risks associated with the reorganization of sales  marketing and engineering activities 
during the fiscal year  the company reorganized its sales  marketing  and certain engineering functions into business units and reorganized its remaining engineering activities for the purpose of increased operational efficiency 
such reorganization and restructuring could have an adverse impact on the company s business and its ability to retain its employees 
the company cannot provide any assurance that reorganizing will achieve the desired financial benefits  nor can the company provide any assurance that the changes will not have an adverse impact on its business or future operating results 
new products and technological change 
the mapping software and information business is characterized by extremely rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions 
these conditions require continuous expenditures on product research and development to enhance existing products and to create new products 
the company believes that the timely development of new products and continuing enhancements to existing products is essential to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace 
during recent years  the company introduced a number of new products  including mapinfo routing j server  mapinfo miaware  mapinfo professional for microsoft sql server and mapinfo discovery 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon customer and market acceptance of these new products and initiatives 
any failure to achieve acceptance of these and other new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products or successfully manage transitions from one product release to the next 
competition 
the company encounters significant competition in the market for business mapping systems worldwide 
some of the company s competition may have significant name recognition  as well as substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and production facilities than the company 
increased competition may lead to pricing pressures that could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
prices of software in europe and asia are generally higher than in the americas to cover localization costs and higher costs of distribution 
such price uplifts could erode in the future 
reliance on third parties 
the company relies in part on resellers and independent developers for the development of specialized data products that use mapinfo software 
failure by such resellers or independent developers to continue to develop such data products  or changes in the contractual arrangements with such resellers or independent developers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risks associated with international operations 
revenues outside the americas represented approximately of total company revenues in fiscal the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including the difficulties in building and managing international operations  reliance on financial commitments from certain international distributors  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into foreign languages  fluctuations in import export duties and quotas  and regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
the company s operating results are also affected by exchange rates 
approximately of the company s revenues were denominated in foreign currencies in changes in international business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
prices 
future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease from previous levels depending upon market or competitive pressures or distribution channel factors 
any decrease could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
intellectual property rights 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret protections  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products  reverse engineer or obtain and use information the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the company s shrink wrap licenses  under which the company licenses its products  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
also  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
any misappropriation of the company s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products 
any such assertion could require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues varies with the mix of technology development and licensing fees  product revenues  services revenues and services utilization rates  as well as with the distribution channel mix 
changes in the revenue mix  as well as the distribution model  may affect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the future 
risks associated with distribution channels 
the company primarily markets and distributes its products in north america  europe and australia through the company s telesales  outside sales force and through third party resellers 
in the rest of the asia pacific region  the company s products are marketed and distributed through exclusive and non exclusive distribution relationships 
while the company has contractual agreements with such resellers and distributors  resellers and distributors are not employees of the company and mapinfo  accordingly  cannot control their continued performance 
there can be no assurance  that the company will be able to retain its current resellers and distributors  that the resellers and distributors will perform to the company s expectations  or that the company will be able to expand its distribution channels by entering into arrangements with new resellers and distributors in the company s current markets or in new markets 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending upon factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and new versions of existing products  the ability to reduce expenses or increase revenues at a level sufficient to offset increases in expenses  the level of technology spending  and the activities of competitors 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  minor variations in the timing of orders and shipments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
the company operates with little or no backlog and has no long term contracts  and substantially all of its product revenues in each quarter result from software and data licenses issued in that quarter 
accordingly  the company s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and income for any period is necessarily limited 
also  the company could experience reduced re venues from telecommunications and internet companies as a result of decreased spending in those industries 
potential volatility of stock price 
there has been  and will likely continue to be  significant volatility in the market price of securities of technology companies  including the company 
factors such as announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  litigation involving the company  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or other software companies financial results  shortfalls in the company s actual financial results compared to results previously forecasted by stock market analysts  the company s stock repurchase program  and general conditions in the software industry and conditions in the financial markets could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
such a decline could adversely impact the ability of the company to attract and retain employees  acquire other companies or businesses and raise capital 
risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
the company has made a number of acquisitions and investments and will continue to review future acquisition opportunities 
no assurances can be given that acquisition candidates will continue to be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things  possible dilution to existing shareholders  difficulties and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions and the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies  the difficulty of operating new businesses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company 
in the event that the operations of an acquired business do not meet expectations  the company may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business 
t here can be no assurance that any acquisition will be successfully integrated into the company s operations 
risks associated with expansion of facilities 
the company completed  in october  the construction of a  square foot facility in troy  new york and has an option to purchase an adjacent  square foot facility  which is currently leased 
the  square foot facility principally houses the company s us based research and development organization 
the  square foot facility was occupied in october and houses the company s corporate offices and the us sales  marketing and administrative organizations 
approximately of the newly constructed office space is vacant and the company is seeking to sublease this vacant space 
the company does not intend to exercise its option to purchase the  square foot facility and is examining its options concerning the consolidation of office space in troy  new york 
there can be no assurance the company will grow at a rate sufficient to fully utilize the troy office space in the near term or will be able to sublease excess office space 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued reliance on attracting and retaining key employees 
the company s continued success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  sales and marketing  executive  and other personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
loss of key personnel or changes in management could have an adverse impact on the company 
risks associated with new accounting pronouncements 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  below 
there can be no assurance that the company s financial results will not be adversely affected by these or other new accounting pronouncements or by the impairment of goodwill 
risks associated with litigation 
see item iii of this annual report on form k 
there can be no assurance the company will not be adversely affected by this proceeding or other proceedings to which the company might be a party in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
the company exports products to diverse geographic locations 
most of the company s international revenues through subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies
