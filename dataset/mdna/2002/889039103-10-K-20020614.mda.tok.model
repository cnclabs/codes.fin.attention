item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s environmental and bodily injury matters 
safety matters the company is also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act osha and similar state statutes 
the company has an extensive health and safety program and employs a staff of safety inspectors whose primary functions are to develop company policies that meet or exceed the safety standards set by osha  train production supervisors and make periodic inspections of safety procedures to insure compliance with company policies on safety and industrial hygiene 
all shipyard employees are required to attend regularly scheduled safety training meetings 
backlog at march  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of million and million at april  and april   respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s three navy phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are awarded 
investments and acquisitions the company has from time to time pursued opportunities to diversify its business  in areas such as metal fabrication  marine transportation  other marine industries and businesses unrelated to the shipyard 
the company continues to evaluate suitable investment opportunities  which it believes will appropriately utilize the company s resources 
during fiscal year the company did not make any direct investments in other businesses  either related or unrelated to ship repair and overhaul activities 
item properties during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year  the puget sound region experienced the effects of a moderate earthquake 
the company sustained damage to its physical plant that required certain emergency repairs to be made in fiscal year all remaining earthquake repairs  of a non emergency nature were made during fiscal year these repairs  which totaled approximately million more than established reserves are included in the company s results from operations 
the company intends to pursue recoveries of its incurred earthquake related costs under its insurance coverage 
the company is required to maintain navy certification on its drydocks and cranes in order to qualify its facilities to bid on and perform work under certain navy and united states coast guard coast guard contracts 
damage caused by the earthquake in fiscal year resulted in the navy temporarily suspending its certifications of the company s three drydocks 
after completing certain repairs  the company s certification on drydock yfd was reinstated prior to the end of fiscal year the company s certification on the emerald sea drydock was reinstated during the first quarter of fiscal year and drydock yfd was reinstated during the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  damage caused by the earthquake resulted in the company making certain repairs to various cranes 
repairs to all cranes that are critical to shipyard operations were made prior to the end of fiscal year and the company obtained re certification on those cranes 
the design capacities of the company s three drydocks  all of which are located at the shipyard  are as follows year type max 
design date of lease name built owned leased capacity in tons expiration emerald sea steel  yfd steel  yfd wood  in fiscal year  the company extended the leases with the navy on both of its leased drydocks for a period of five years 
under terms of the expiring leases  the company was required to make annual lease payments  as well as perform a minimum amount of annual maintenance on each dock 
the new lease terms on drydock yfd contain a nominal annual lease payment and an increase in the minimum amount of annual maintenance that the company must perform 
the new lease also includes minimum levels of maintenance that the company must perform during the life of the lease 
the new lease terms on drydock yfd call for a continuation of both an annual lease payment and a certain minimum amount of annual maintenance to be performed by the company 
the company has included the nominal annual lease payment and the average annual maintenance cost that must be performed over the life of the lease on drydock yfd  as well as the annual lease payments that must be made on drydock yfd in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item the company s current navy drydock certifications are less than the drydock s maximum design capacity  however they are sufficient to allow the company to perform work on all non nuclear navy vessels homeported in puget sound  as well as all coast guard and washington state ferry vessels 
the company believes that its owned and leased properties at the shipyard are in reasonable operating condition given their age and usage  although  from time to time  the company has been required to incur substantial expenditures to ensure the continuing serviceability of its owned and leased machinery and equipment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company determined that such serviceability repairs would be required on the emerald sea to maintain navy certification on a long term basis 
these repairs began during the first quarter of fiscal year and continued throughout the fiscal year and are included in the company s results of operations 
during fiscal year  the company evaluated several alternative repair scenarios and management s plans for future operations and developed a comprehensive  multi year refurbishment plan that will allow the company to maintain certification into the future 
this multi year plan includes scheduled refurbishment periods so that repairs do not interfere with on going shipyard operations 
the company will continue to assess this refurbishment plan as it progresses and make appropriate changes as needed to support shipyard operations 
item legal proceedings the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these laws 
such laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for acts of the company  which are or were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the company faces potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company is identified as a prp by the environmental protection agency epa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund in connection with matters pending at three superfund sites 
additionally  the company has been named as a prp in three superfund cases and has received information requests in two superfund cases where the company has asserted that its liability was discharged when it emerged from bankruptcy in generally these environmental claims relate to sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
at march   the company maintained aggregate reserves of million for pending claims and assessments relating to environmental matters  including million associated with the harbor island superfund site the harbor island site and a reserve of million for asbestos related claims 
funding for costs and payments of claims represented by such reserves is expected to be provided to a significant extent by receivables due from insurance companies under policies and insurance in place agreements described below 
at march   such receivables aggregated million 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below and to the discussion under the heading environmental matters and contingencies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item below 
harbor island site the company and several other parties have been named as prps by the epa pursuant to cercla in connection with the documented release or threatened release of hazardous substances  pollutants and contaminants at the harbor island superfund site  the harbor island site 
harbor island site insurance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of all of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount exceeding the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the second payment was made in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable in accordance with its environmental accounting policies at the time it entered into this agreement 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
harbor island site history to date  the epa has separated the harbor island site into three operable units that affect the company the soil and groundwater unit the soil unit  the shipyard sediments operable unit the ssou and the sediments operable unit the sou 
the company  along with a number of other harbor island prps  received a special notice letter from the epa on may  pursuant to section e of cercla 
the company entered into a consent decree for the soil unit in september under which the company has agreed to remediate the designated contamination on its property 
removal of floating petroleum product from the water table began in october and is anticipated to continue through fiscal year the company and the epa are currently negotiating the extent and methodology of the soil remediation 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa issued its record of decision rod for the ssou 
the rod identifies four alternative solutions for the ssou remediation and identifies the epa s selected remedy 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa expanded the boundaries of the ssou issuing their phase b data report and resulting explanation of significant differences outlining the changes to the rod 
the company evaluated what it believed was the financial impact of the epa s actions and increased its reserves to million for the remedial effort 
this reserve increase resulted in a million charge against fiscal year earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent for the development of the remedial design for the ssou 
management anticipates that during fiscal year agreement will be reached with the epa on a remedial design that identifies the scope of remediation and the method of sediment disposal 
pursuant to the current schedule  remediation of the ssou is expected to begin in the third quarter of fiscal current environmental regulations limit the period of time during the year that dredging may occur 
given these limits  dredging in the ssou will require several years to complete 
the ultimate cost of the ssou clean up will remain uncertain until agreement has been reached with the epa during fiscal year during january  the company was notified by the epa that testing would be required in the west waterway of the duwamish river outside the borders of the ssou as part of the sou 
during may  the company entered into an administrative order on consent to perform certain limited testing as part of the sou investigation 
after an evaluation of the results  the epa issued a draft no action rod on the sou for public comment which if issued in final form would end the investigation of the sou  requiring no remedial action 
the public comment period closed during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the epa has not yet announced the results 
during the company s fiscal year  several species of salmon in washington state were designated under the endangered species act 
the potential impact the designation could have on the remedial efforts on the harbor island superfund site is unknown at this time  although any related costs within aggregate policy limits will be covered by insurance purchased in january as of march   the company believes that aggregate policy limits are currently adequate to cover this potential impact 
asbestos related claims and insurance the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
at march   the company had approximately cases involving approximately plaintiffs pending against it and other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers and equipment manufacturers  involving injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and developed  analyzing them in two different categories based on severity of illness 
based on current fact patterns  certain diseases including mesothelioma  lung cancer and fully developed asbestosis are categorized by the company as malignant claims 
all others of a less medically serious nature are categorized as non malignant 
the company is currently defending approximately malignant claims and approximately non malignant claims 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s which resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgement of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as the years remaining calculation set forth below indicates  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at april   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
the increased declination of estimated coverage experienced from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to increased settlement activity on malignant cases including six cases that had been in inventory dating back as far as the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s share of responsibility will increase for any subsequent claims and legal expense previously covered by these insurance agreements 
in addition to providing coverage for assessments or settlements of claims  the agreements also provide for costs of defending and processing such claims 
the following chart indicates numbers of claims filed and resolved in the past three fiscal years  including the number of claims yet to be resolved at the end of each fiscal year 
resolution includes settlements  adjudications and dismissals 
the claims are further categorized as either malignant or non malignant 
bodily injury claims non malignant malignant total outstanding  march  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  april  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  april  claims filed claims resolved outstanding  march  due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the costs of resolving the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against it or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity

item selected consolidated financial data in thousands of dollars  except per share data the following table summarizes certain selected consolidated financial data of the company  which should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company included in item march  april  april  march  march  revenue      income from operations      net income      net income per share of common stock basic eps diluted eps financial position working capital      fixed assets      total assets      stockholders equity      as discussed in greater detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share through its tender offer dutch auction that was completed as of july  the company s working capital  total assets  and stockholders equity declined approximately million as a result of the share repurchases and related transactions 
the company s revenues were impacted favorably by an agreement reached with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs 
under terms of the agreement  the company was able to invoice and record revenue of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the agreement also allows the company to recognize an additional million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  the company received a favorable arbitration award on the margarita ii  a floating electrical power plant that was completed in fiscal year the award allowed the company to recognize million of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  the company recorded a net insurance settlement of million  which was partially offset by a million environmental and other reserve charge  resulting in an increase to income from operations of million 
total assets for fiscal years through have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation change in insurance receivables 
during fiscal year  the company recorded an additional million operating charge for environmental and other reserves 
this charge was partially offset by a million insurance settlement the company reached with one of its insurance carriers 
the company s revenues included million arising from an increase in the contract price relating to the construction of three jumbo mark ii ferries  and an additional million in revenue associated with tasks completed under the original contract that it had not been able to recognize previously 
in fiscal and earlier years  the company had recognized significant losses in connection with the contract involving the jumbo mark ii ferries 
during fiscal year  the company reached agreement with an insurance company regarding that carrier s obligations for property damage occurring in previous fiscal years 
this settlement contributed million to operating income 
this settlement was offset partially by an additional million operating charge to environmental and other reserves 
during fiscal year  the company received a federal income tax refund of million  which contributed a similar amount to net income 
in addition  the company realized a million gain on the sale of its broadcasting stations  operated by elettra broadcasting  inc item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations the notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction herewith 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may impact results for future periods are discussed below under the captions overview profitability  and environmental matters 
readers should also consider the statements and factors discussed under the caption operations overview in item and the discussion of environmental matters and related bodily injury claims set forth in item of the this annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission for the fiscal year ended march   together with the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year then ended 
overview during fiscal year  the company recorded revenue of million  which represents an increase of million  or approximately  over fiscal year reported revenue of million 
this revenue increase is primarily attributable to an increase in commercial and government repair and overhaul activities of million  offset by a decrease in new construction revenue of million 
increases in repair and overhaul activities are primarily due to the scheduling by ship owners of commercial and government overhaul activities 
decreases in new construction revenue are caused by the absence of new construction activities being performed by the company in fiscal year and reflect the company s decision to focus on repair and overhaul opportunities 
fiscal year revenue benefited from the impact of two significant events 
first  the company reached an agreement with the us navy in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to share in certain environmental insurance costs 
under terms of the agreement  the company was able to invoice and record revenue of million in fiscal year this amount was reduced to million in fiscal year second  the company received a favorable arbitration award on the margarita ii  a new construction project that was completed in fiscal year the award allowed the company to recognize million of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year repair and overhaul activities represented approximately and of fiscal year and fiscal year revenues  respectively 
the high concentration of repair and overhaul activities during the past two fiscal years reflects the company s business strategy of emphasizing repair and overhaul activities  while discontinuing the pursuit of new construction opportunities 
this strategy has been a central component of the company s business plan since the completion of the margarita ii in fiscal year during fiscal year the company recorded operating income of million on revenue of million  or approximately of revenue 
this represents a decrease in operating income of million  or approximately from fiscal year operating income reported of million 
operating income for fiscal year was impacted favorably by the agreement reached with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs  as well as the arbitration award on the margarita ii 
in addition to the favorable impact of these two items  the company recorded a net insurance settlement of million  which was partially offset by a million environmental and other reserve charge  resulting in a net increase to operating income of million for the fiscal year 
the company also recognized a net gain of million from the sale of available for sale securities  and million in non operating investment income during fiscal year these amounts in addition to the operating income reported  resulted in fiscal year income before income tax expense of million 
auxiliary oiler explosive aoe contract during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded a six year  sole source cost type contract for phased maintenance repairs to four department of navy aoe class supply ships 
this contract represents the fourth consecutive  multi year contract that the company has been awarded by the navy on the aoe class vessels 
the notional value of this new contract is expected to be approximately million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract is being performed primarily in the company s seattle shipyard 
combatant maintenance team cmt contract during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded  by the department of the navy on a sole source basis  a five year  cost type contract for the repair and maintenance of six surface combatant class vessels frigates and destroyers stationed in the puget sound area 
although the navy has not released a notional value of the maintenance work  the company believes that the value may be approximately million to million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract is being performed primarily in the company s seattle shipyard 
planned incremental availability pia during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the department of the navy awarded the company a five year cost type contract for phased maintenance on three cvn class aircraft carriers 
the notional value for this five year contract is approximately million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract is currently being performed at the puget sound naval shipyard  located in bremerton  washington 
preservation contract the mv yakima during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded a million overhaul contract to renovate the washington state ferry  mv yakima 
work on this project commenced during the third quarter of fiscal year and called for the replacement or renovation of the majority of the vessel s interior structures  including the replacement of steel plating  passenger area furniture  galley  fixtures  windows  and the removal of hazardous materials 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company successfully completed and delivered the vessel to the washington state ferry system ahead of the contractually scheduled delivery date 
the company earned financial incentives for the early delivery of the vessel and these incentives were recognized in fiscal year contract revenue 
power barge contract the margarita ii in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company commenced work on a floating electrical power plant  the margarita ii 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the margarita ii was delivered to its owner 
to maintain production schedule deadlines and perform customer directed change orders the company experienced significant contract cost growth in both labor hours and material 
however  at the time of vessel delivery  an agreement had not reached between the company and the owner regarding the potential increase in the contract price to compensate for all of these changes 
in accordance with the terms of the contract  the company and the vessel owner agreed to settle the remaining change orders through a formal arbitration process 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company was awarded approximately million  as well as interest and certain agreed expenses from the arbitration board 
the company recognized the award in fiscal year critical accounting policies the company s established accounting policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this form k entitled principal accounting policies 
as part of its reporting responsibilities  management continually evaluates and reviews the adequacy of its accounting policies and methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies are applied in a consistent manner that provides the user of the company s financial statements with a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how these judgments and estimates can impact the company s financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that management believes may contain difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the company s results of operation 
the company has identified its most critical accounting policies which relate to revenue recognition and environmental remediation  bodily injury  other reserves  and insurance receivable 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  contract costs  and profit on the percentage of completion method based upon direct labor hours incurred 
using the percentage of completion method requires the company to make certain estimates of the total cost to complete a project  estimates of project schedule and completion dates  estimates of the percentage of which the project is complete  estimates of annual overhead rates and estimates of amounts of any probable unapproved claims and or change orders 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated by experienced project office and accounting personnel assigned to manage these activities  and senior management also reviews them on a periodic basis 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  any changes from prior estimates are generally reflected in revenue in the current period 
the company has considerable experience in managing multiple projects simultaneously and in preparing accurate cost estimates  schedules and project completion dates 
however  many factors  including but not limited to weather  fluctuations in material prices  labor shortages  and timely availability of materials can affect the accuracy of these estimates and may impact our future revenues either favorably or unfavorably 
us government procurement standards are followed relative to assessing the allowability as well as the allocability of costs charged to government contracts 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are closely scrutinized for compliance with underlying regulatory standards by todd pacific shipyards personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
environmental remediation  bodily injury  other reserves and insurance receivable the company faces potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of civil actions alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at former company facilities that are now closed 
at march   the company maintained aggregate reserves of million for pending claims and assessments relating to these environmental matters  including million associated with the company s seattle shipyard site and million for asbestos or bodily injury related claims 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage on the costs to remediate these environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury claims 
at march   the company had recorded an insurance receivable of million relating to these environmental and bodily injury matters  including million associated with the company s seattle shipyard site and million for bodily injury related claims 
the company reviews these matters on a continual basis and revises its estimates of known liabilities and insurance recoveries when appropriate 
the company follows guidance provided in statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities for recording its environmental liabilities and recoveries 
the company accounts for bodily injury liabilities in accordance with financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating environmental remediation liabilities requires judgments and assessments based upon independent professional knowledge  the experience of company management and our legal counsel 
environmental liabilities are based on judgments that include calculating the cost of alternative remediation methods and disposal sites  changes in the boundaries of the remediation sites  and the impact of regulatory changes 
bodily injury liabilities are based on judgments that include the number of outstanding claims  the expected most likely outcome of any claim litigation and anticipated settlement amounts for open claims based on historical experience 
the company does not accrue liabilities for unknown bodily injury claims that may be asserted in the future due to uncertainties of the number of cases that may be filed and the extent of alleged damages 
the development of liability estimates that support both environmental remediation and bodily injury reserves involve complex matters that include the development of estimates and the use of judgments 
the actual outcome of these matters may differ from company estimates 
to the extent not covered by insurance  increases to environmental remediation and bodily injury liabilities would unfavorably impact future earnings 
the company s insurance recoveries for environmental remediation and bodily injury claims are estimated independently from the associated liabilities and are based on insurance coverages or contractual agreements negotiated with its former insurance companies 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit rating of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both insurance companies will be able to satisfy their respective obligations under the policy or agreement 
however  if this assumption is incorrect and either of these companies is unable to meet its future financial commitments  the company s financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
business volume and backlog at march  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of million and million at april  and april   respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s three navy phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are awarded 
profitability the company s future profitability depends largely on the ability of the shipyard to maintain an adequate volume of ship repair  overhaul and conversion business to augment its longer term contracts 
the variables affecting the company s business volume include public support provided to competing northwest shipyards  excess west coast and industry wide shipyard capacity  foreign competition  governmental legislation and regulatory issues  activity levels of the us navy  competitors pricing behavior  and company labor efficiencies and work practices 
other factors that can contribute to future profitability include the amounts of annual expenditures needed to ensure continuing seviceability of the company s owned and leased machinery and equipment 
the company continues to respond aggressively to the increasingly competitive shipbuilding and repair industry 
in addition to management s focus on the profitability of existing shipyard operations through reduced operating costs  improved production efficiencies and the pursuit of business volume  management continues to evaluate options for deployment of assets with a view to improving the company s return on investment 
year to year comparisons compared with net income for fiscal year decreased by million from fiscal year levels 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the following four significant events 
in fiscal year  the company reached a settlement with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs  which resulted in the company recognizing million in revenue 
the amount the company was able to recognize in fiscal year under terms of this agreement decreased to million 
in fiscal year  the company received an arbitration award on the margarita ii  which contributed approximately million in revenue  interest income and reimbursed expenses 
in fiscal year  the company recognized million in federal income tax expense while in fiscal year it recorded a federal income tax benefit of million resulting from the elimination of its deferred tax asset valuation reserve 
this change resulted in a million increase in federal income tax expense in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the company s pension income decreased million when compared to fiscal year see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details 
net income for fiscal year was also influenced as a result of the following components revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represents an increase of million  or approximately over fiscal year revenue 
all revenue recorded by the company in fiscal year was attributable to repair and overhaul activities compared to million in repair and overhaul revenue recorded in fiscal year this increase in repair and overhaul activities of million was offset by a decrease in new construction revenue in fiscal year of million 
increases in repair and overhaul activities are primarily due to the scheduling by ship owners of commercial and government overhaul activities 
new construction revenue recorded in fiscal year was attributable to the margarita ii arbitration settlement 
the absence of new construction revenue in fiscal year is due to the company s primary business strategy of focusing on repair  maintenance and conversion activities 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or approximately from fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to the million in revenue the company recognized on the agreement with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs and the million recognized on the margarita ii arbitration award in fiscal year costs associated with these revenues were either incurred in prior years or are not categorized as cost of revenues  which effectively lowered the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year if these amounts were excluded from revenue the resulting cost of revenues as a percentage of revised revenue would have been in fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead administrative and manufacturing overhead increased million  or approximately from fiscal year this increase was attributable to increased production volumes during the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  administrative and manufacturing overhead was approximately of revenue in fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal year  but would have been if revenues were adjusted to exclude the favorable impacts to revenue that occurred that year 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year  the company estimated that the expected remediation costs associated with the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site increased by approximately million 
this increase in environmental reserves was offset by a similar increase in the company s insurance receivable 
the recognition of these increases did not impact the company s financial results or stockholders equity 
also  in fiscal year  the company received reimbursement from a certain harbor island potentially responsible party for certain past environmental costs incurred by the company 
this reimbursement in the amount of million is reflected in other insurance settlements in the financial results reported at march  during fiscal year  the company provided million in additional environmental and other reserves 
the reserve increase was fully offset by a net insurance settlement of million realized by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year decreased by million when compared to fiscal year this decrease reflects the reduction in available funds for investment purposes as a result of the company s repurchase of million shares in july through its dutch auction tender offer 
the share repurchase decreased available funds for investment purposes by approximately million 
gain on sale of available for sale securities gain on sale of available for sale securities increased million when compared to fiscal year this increase reflects favorable market conditions associated with certain securities which were sold by the company 
income taxes in fiscal year  the company recognized federal income tax expense of million

environmental matters and other contingencies the company has provided total aggregate reserves of million as of march  for the forgoing contingent environmental and bodily injury liabilities 
due to the complexities and extensive history of the company s environmental and bodily injury matters  the amounts and timing of future expenditures is uncertain 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these environmental and bodily injury matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the company has various insurance policies and agreements that provide coverage on the costs to remediate environmental sites and for the defense and settlement of bodily injury cases 
these policies and agreements are primarily with two insurance companies 
based upon the current credit rating of both of these companies  the company anticipates that both parties will be able to perform under their respective policy or agreement 
as of march   the company has recorded an insurance receivable of million to reflect the contractual arrangements with several insurance companies to share costs for certain environmental and other matters 
the company continues to negotiate with its insurance carriers and certain prior landowners and operators for past and future remediation costs 
in addition  the company believes that the government may be obligated to contribute a share of clean up costs for certain sites and any such recoveries may be subrogated  in whole or in part  in favor of the company s insurers 
the company has not recorded any receivables for any amounts that may be recoverable from such negotiations or other claims 
ongoing operations recurring costs associated with the company s environmental compliance program are not material and are expensed as incurred

the company has also been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances at company facilities 
information with respect to these contingencies and claims is provided in item in this report 
the company s policy is to accrue costs for environmental matters in the accounting period in which the responsibility is established and the cost is estimable 
the company s estimates of its liabilities for environmental matters are based on evaluations of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the results of negotiations with regulatory authorities 
the company does not discount these liabilities 
in fiscal year  the company directly spent million for environmental site remediation 
all of these costs are reimbursable to the company through its insurance coverages 
an additional million in environmental site remediation was spent by third party vendors under the direction of the company s management 
these costs were paid directly to the third party vendors under the company s insurance policies 
most of these expenditures were related to the harbor island site 
in fiscal year and  the company spent approximately million and million on environmental site remediation  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million and million were reimbursable to the company under the company s insurance policies 
in addition to environmental site remediation costs  the company spent million for bodily injury cases after reimbursement under the company s insurance policies in fiscal year in fiscal year and  the company spent million and million  respectively for bodily injury cases after reimbursement under the company s insurance policies 
actual costs to address the harbor island site and other environmental sites and matters will depend upon numerous factors  including the number of parties found liable at each environmental site  the method of remediation  outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcome of litigation  technological developments and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
in fiscal  the company evaluated the financial impact of epa actions changing the epa s selected remedy relating to dredging affecting the shipyard sediments operable unit at the harbor island site and increased its reserves through a charge to fiscal year earnings in the amount of million 
the company anticipates that estimates of the cost of remediation will remain significantly uncertain until agreement on the selected remedy is reached 
such agreement is currently anticipated to occur in fiscal remediation costs at the harbor island site may also be impacted by recent designation of several species of salmon under the endangered species act 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount exceeding the company s current booked reserves of million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the second payment was made in the first quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable in accordance with its environmental accounting policies at the time it entered into this agreement 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
at march   the company had approximately cases involving approximately plaintiffs pending against it and other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers and equipment manufacturers  involving injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company assesses claims as they are filed and developed  analyzing them in two different categories based on severity of illness 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
the company s policy is to record accruals for bodily injury liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated based on the known facts 
accordingly  potential expenses for claims that may be filed in the future related to alleged damage from past exposure to toxic substances are not estimable and are not included in the company s reserves 
accruals for bodily injury liabilities are adjusted periodically as new or updated information becomes available 
the company has entered into agreements with several of its insurers to provide coverage for a significant portion of settlements and awards related to these bodily injury claims 
these agreements have aggregate limits on amounts to be paid overall and formulas for amounts of payment on individual claims 
the two most significant agreements provide coverage applicable to claims of exposure to asbestos occurring between and and occurring between through insurance coverage for exposures to asbestos was no longer available from the insurance industry after due to changes in federal regulations in the s which resulted in the swift decline in commercial and military application of asbestos and increased regulation over the handling and removal of asbestos  there exists minimal risk of claims arising from exposure after contractual formulas are utilized to determine the amount of coverage from each agreement on each claim settled or litigated 
once the initial date of alleged exposure to asbestos is determined  all contractual years subsequent to that date participate in the settlement 
since all known claims involve alleged exposure prior to  the through agreement will participate in the settlement or judgement of all outstanding claims that are settled or litigated 
as a result  and as the years remaining calculation set forth below indicates  the through agreement will exhaust prior to the through agreement 
based on historical claims settlement data only  the company projects that at march   the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years and the through agreement will provide coverage for an additional years 
at april   the company projected that these agreements would provide coverage for an additional years and years  respectively 
the increased declination of estimated coverage experienced from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to increased settlement activity on malignant cases including six cases that had been in inventory dating back as far as the company resolved malignant claims in compared with in and in if historical settlement patterns or the rate of filing for new cases change in future periods  these estimated coverage periods could be shorter or longer than anticipated 
moreover  if one or both of these coverages are exhausted at some future date  the company s share of responsibility will increase for any subsequent claims and legal expense previously covered by these insurance agreements 
at march   the company has recorded a bodily injury liability reserve of million and a bodily injury insurance receivable of million 
at april   the company recorded a bodily injury liability reserve of million and a bodily injury insurance receivable of million 
these bodily injury liabilities and receivables are classified within the company s consolidated balance sheets as environmental and other reserves  and insurance receivables  respectively 
due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will be adequate to cover the existing cases 
additionally  the company cannot predict the eventual number of cases to be filed against the company or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
however  it is probable that if future cases are filed against the company it will result in additional costs arising either from its share of costs under current insurance in place arrangements or due to the exhaustion of such coverage 
the company reviews the adequacy of existing reserves periodically based upon developments affecting these claims  including new filings and resolutions  and makes adjustments to the reserve and related insurance receivable as appropriate 
as the company is not able to estimate its potential ultimate exposure for filed and unfiled claims against the company  it cannot predict whether the ultimate resolution of the bodily injury cases will have a material effect on the company s results of operations or stockholders equity
