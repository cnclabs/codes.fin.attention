management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  fiscal again set new records for financial performance 
total consolidated revenues increased by million  or  compared to last year 
tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from the previous fiscal year 
tuition revenue is reported net of tuition refunds  consistent with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin entitled revenue recognition in financial statements and associated guidance 
other educational revenues is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies  including the becker conviser cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding receivable balances 
other educational revenues increased by as the number of students enrolled in the company s educational programs who purchase such materials increased from last year 
the rate of increase in other educational revenues was less than the rate of increase in tuition revenues  in part  because of the continued outsourcing of devry university bookstore management  which is discussed more fully below 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by million  or  from last year because of somewhat lower cash balances that were available for investment during the first half of the year as the company repaid borrowings under the revolving line for the purchase of two devry university campuses  lower interest rates available on investments and the application of cash balances to offset fees for bank services instead of short term investment 
the company s principal business is providing postsecondary education 
the company has presented its financial results in two reportable segments 
in february  the higher learning commission of the north central association approved the merger of devry institutes undergraduate programs and keller graduate school of management graduate programs into a single educational institution named devry university 
the north central association is one of six regional bodies that make up the nation s system for accrediting colleges and universities 
in support of the transition to devry university  the company s resources and organization have been restructured to better serve the needs of its students  employers of its graduates and shareholders 
accordingly  the reportable segments of the company have been realigned to reflect this combination and the prior year discussion of results of operations has been revised for consistency with the new structure 
devry university segment revenues increased by million  or  from last year 
revenue increases resulted from increased cumulative total student enrollment for the terms in the fiscal year in both the undergraduate and graduate programs 
at the start of the spring term  which spans a part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  there were  students enrolled in devry university undergraduate and graduate programs compared to  students in the spring term of the previous year 
although total devry university enrollments have continued to increase  undergraduate program offerings are heavily concentrated in the areas of computer and electronics technology 
interest in these programs as careers has been adversely affected by the news of employee layoffs and financial difficulty encountered by many firms in the technology sector of the economy 
as a result  new undergraduate student enrollments have declined from year ago levels by  and in the last three semesters  fall  spring and summer fiscal  respectively 
new undergraduate campus openings in federal way seattle  washington  and crystal city washington dc  virginia  and several new graduate school center openings during fiscal helped to reduce the effect of declining new students enrollments at previously opened campuses and contributed to the increased total student enrollment 
tuition rate increases of approximately also contributed to the increased revenues for the year 
at the start of the summer term  which is the first term in fiscal  total devry university enrollment was  compared to  last summer 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett during fiscal to manage some of the undergraduate and graduate on campus bookstores and provide internet order capability to students at these campuses 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett is believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing campus bookstores  including those at the two new campuses opened during the year  compared to nine campus bookstores under follett management a year ago 
sales at campus bookstores under follett management  net of commissions paid to devry university  were approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal and responsibility for managing additional campus bookstores may be transferred to follett in the future  based upon the needs of each campus 
in the professional and training segment  revenues increased by million  or 
increased numbers of students taking the becker conviser cpa review course in the classroom  on cd rom or online and expanded offerings of the stalla cfa review program plus tuition price increases contributed to the increased revenue 
in fiscal  cost of educational services increased by million  or 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which represents approximately of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
additions to long lived assets in devry university were million  an increase of million from last year  as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
included in the additions for fiscal was the purchase for approximately million  at the start of the year  of two undergraduate campuses formerly occupied under lease 
as a result of the additions to facilities and equipment  including the two new campuses and several graduate centers opened during the year  depreciation expense in devry university  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased by million  or 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from last year 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending reflects marketing costs associated with generating higher student enrollments in the company s educational programs for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term of fiscal  which began in july 
generally  expenditures for new student recruitment precede the time periods in which there is revenue generated by these new student enrollments 
during the year  to counter declining response rates to advertising for the undergraduate technology programs  advertising expenses were increased beyond those originally planned and beyond the historical rate of increase in this expense category 
offsetting some of the advertising expense increase were savings in selling expense as sales representatives in some remote area sales territories were eliminated to better match the costs with revenues generated in these territories 
also  in response to the growing size and complexity of its educational program offerings  the company continued its design and development of a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
information system development costs related to this project  and to other system support and improvement initiatives  have increased from last year 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting service costs are being capitalized 
indirect expenses related to the project  such as training and employee communications  are charged to expense as incurred 
at the end of june  total capitalized costs were million  of which million was capitalized in fiscal year in addition to the amounts capitalized  million of related but indirect activity was charged directly to expense during the year 
during the fourth quarter of the year  two elements of the overall system design were put into service and amortization was initiated over the expected useful lives  not exceeding five years 
in the fourth quarter  a total of million of previously capitalized student system development costs were charged to amortization expense 
one of the company s directors is also an investor and director of a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with systems development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm during fiscal year totaled million 
fees paid to this consulting firm have been negotiated to a level believed to be equal to those charged to similar customers 
the company estimates that fees paid to this consulting firm in the coming year will be reduced somewhat from the level incurred in fiscal as these systems projects near completion 
partly offsetting the increased student recruitment expenses and information system development costs during the year was a reduction of million in amortization expense of intangible assets and goodwill compared to the same period a year ago as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 entitled goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets arising from a business combination are no longer amortized and charged to expense over time 
instead  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles must be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment 
for goodwill  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit containing the goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of june   there was no impairment loss associated with the company s indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill associated with the reporting units represented by the company s two operating segments 
in the devry university segment  although the amount of operating income increased from last year by  operating margin as a percent of revenues declined from last year to in the current year 
the increased level of spending on student recruitment  increased spending on information systems design and the opening of two new undergraduate campuses and several graduate school centers all contributed to the lower operating margin 
in the professional and training segment  operating margin increased from last year to this year 
operating efficiencies from increased enrollments and higher tuition pricing all contributed to the higher operating margin 
the company s earnings from operations in fiscal before interest expense and taxes were a record million  increasing by from last year 
operating margin  which has increased during each of the past several years  increased again from last year to this year 
contributing to the increased margin was the adoption  at the start of the fiscal year  of sfas relating to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  which reduced amortization expense from the previous year by approximately million 
operating margin was also improved by the continued outsourcing of low margin bookstore sales and operating economies from increased student enrollments 
interest expense increased to million this year as the company borrowed money at the start of the fiscal year under its revolving loan agreement to acquire two undergraduate campuses formerly occupied under lease 
the borrowings  which occurred in july  were not fully repaid until april 
taxes on income were incurred at a rate of of pre tax income for the year  compared to last year 
last year s rate was affected by changes to future tax rates in canada that reduced the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets in canada and increased tax expense for the year 
net income of million  or per share diluted  was a record for any year 
this compares to net income of million  or per share diluted in  which included per share of goodwill and intangible asset amortization that was discontinued in with the adoption of sfas fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  fiscal set new records for financial performance 
total consolidated revenues increased by million  or  compared to last year 
tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from the previous fiscal year 
tuition revenue for previous years was restated to consistently reflect the categorization of tuition refunds as a reduction in tuition revenue rather than as a component of cost of educational services  consistent with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab entitled revenue recognition in financial statements and associated guidance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company applied the accounting and disclosure provisions of sab sab requires the deferral of certain fees and other charges over the period of service student enrollment 
prior to fiscal  the company recognized enrollment fees in the next academic period after which the applicant had no further right to use or refund 
additionally  tuition refunds were reported as a cost of educational services and have been restated as previously discussed 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sab  as of the start of fiscal  the company deferred approximately million of certain fees 
this deferred revenue will be recognized in future periods based upon our historical experience of expected future student attendance 
additionally  as of the start of the fiscal year  the company has elected to defer certain direct costs associated with new student enrollment activities but limited to the extent of revenue deferral 
these costs will be subsequently amortized over the same period of expected future student attendance used to recognize deferred revenues 
as revenues from enrollment fees and related costs were deferred in equal amounts as of the start of the fiscal year  net income and cash flow from operations were not affected 
at june   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue and related costs recorded on its balance sheet  approximately the same amount as of the start of the fiscal year 
other educational revenues is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies  including the becker conviser cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding receivable balances 
although there were more students enrolled in the company s educational programs and they purchased more books and materials than in the past year  other educational revenues declined by million  or  from last year because of the continued outsourcing of devry university bookstore management  which is discussed more fully below 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased to million because of the somewhat lower cash balances that were available for investment during the year 
devry university segment revenues increased by million  or  from last year 
revenue increases resulted from increased cumulative total student enrollment for the terms in the fiscal year in both the undergraduate and graduate programs 
at the start of the spring term  there were  students enrolled in devry university undergraduate and graduate programs compared to  students in the spring term of the previous year 
enrollments increased because of a new undergraduate campus opening in tinley park  illinois  in july this is the third undergraduate campus in the chicago area 
also  in november  a new undergraduate campus opened in orlando  florida  the first undergraduate campus in that state 
enrollment at the previously opened undergraduate campuses also increased somewhat during the year 
also during the year  six new graduate centers were opened  bringing the total to  and tuition was increased by approximately during the year 
during fiscal  devry university began to offer its undergraduate business administration degree program via distance education on a limited basis 
the start of this first undergraduate distance education program offering did not significantly contribute to enrollments or revenues during the year 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett during fiscal to manage some of the undergraduate and graduate on campus bookstores and provide internet ordering capability to devry students at these campuses 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett is believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing nine campus bookstores  including those at the two new campuses opened during the year  compared to four campus book stores under follett management at the previous june year end 
sales at the campus bookstores under follett management  net of commissions paid to devry  were approximately and million  respectively  in fiscal and in july  follett began managing two additional campus bookstores 
responsibility for managing additional campus bookstores may be transferred to follett in the future  based upon the needs of each campus 
in the professional and training segment  revenues increased by million  or  from last year 
in january  the company acquired the stalla seminars cfa exam review as a complement to its becker conviser professional review programs  increasing the revenues in this segment 
however  enrollments and revenues in the cpa review program continued to be negatively affected by additional state implementations of the hour rule that requires cpa exam candidates to have completed hours of college credit  generally a fifth year of college  before they are eligible to sit for the cpa exam 
in fiscal  cost of educational services increased by million  or 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which represents approximately of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials cost of sales  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
additions to long lived assets in devry university were million  an increase of million from last year as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
as a result of these additions to facilities and equipment  depreciation expense  most of which is included in the cost of educational services category  increased by million from last year 
although costs increased generally in support of increased enrollments and new operating locations primarily in the devry university segment  the consolidated cost of educational services increased at a rate substantially less than the rate of increase in tuition revenues 
the lesser rate of cost growth is due almost entirely to the elimination of the cost of sales on books and supplies at the devry university bookstores now managed by follett 
the company now reports commission income in other educational revenues with no corresponding cost of sales 
economies of scale  as enrollment increased at most existing operating locations  further contributed to the lower rate of cost increase 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from last year 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending reflects marketing costs associated with generating higher student enrollments in the company s educational programs for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term of fiscal  which began in july 
generally  expenditures for new student recruitment occur in time periods that precede the time periods in which there is revenue generated by these new student enrollments 
also  in response to the growing size and complexity of its educational program offerings  the company began to design and develop a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
information system development costs related to this project  and to other system support and improvement initiatives  have increased from last year 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting service costs are being capitalized 
indirect expenses related to the project  such as training and employee communications  are charged to expense as incurred 
at the end of june  total capitalized costs were approximately million  while approximately million of systems development costs were charged to expense as incurred 
amortization of capitalized system development costs will begin in future periods as portions of the project become operational 
in the devry university segment  the operating income margin for the year improved from last year to in the current fiscal year because of the effect of the outsourcing of certain low margin bookstore operations to follett and because of economies of scale as increased enrollments were absorbed into the existing cost structure 
partially offsetting these gains were the additional costs related to the two new undergraduate campuses and six new graduate teaching centers opened during the year and an approximately million currency conversion loss with respect to devry canada as the value of the canadian dollar declined relative to the us dollar during the year 
in the professional and training segment  the operating margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal because of the january acquisition of the stalla seminars cfa review program and operating economies as the conviser cpa operations acquired at the start of fiscal were further integrated into the becker operations 
the company s earnings from operations in fiscal before interest and taxes were a record million  increasing by from last year 
operating margin  which has steadily increased during each of the past several years  reached this year  up from last year 
contributing to the increase in margin has been the outsourcing of the low margin bookstore sales and operating economies from increased student enrollments 
interest expense decreased by million from last year as the company operated through most of the year either debt free or with very low levels of debt despite record capital spending and the acquisition  for cash  of stalla seminars 
taxes on income for the year were affected by a change in tax rates applicable to the company s canadian operations 
during the fourth quarter  canadian customs and revenue received royal assent to reduce federal and certain provincial income tax rates in future periods 
the effect of this change in enacted tax rates through the end of the third quarter of the fiscal year was  without the change in enacted tax rates  tax expense for the total year would have been reduced by  further reductions in provincial enacted income tax rates are expected in future periods 
the effect of these future expected reductions  had they been enacted in the fiscal year ended june   would have been to reduce the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets by an additional  the cumulative impact of these reductions will be reflected in the quarter s when the rates are enacted by royal assent 
net income of million  or per share diluted  was a record for any year  increasing by from last year 
application of critical accounting policies the company s financial statements include numerous estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses whose exact amounts will not be known until future periods 
actual amounts may differ from the estimates included in the financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   fully describes the method of application of the more critical accounting policies listed below 
significant estimates included in the company s financial statements include the method of revenue recognition across the academic periods  determining the useful lives of equipment and facilities whose value is a significant portion of the company s total assets  determining the amount and useful lives of acquired finite lived intangible assets  assessing the valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  estimating losses to be realized in the future on the collection of presently owed student receivable balances  estimating costs associated with any settlement of law suits in which the company is a defendant and estimating health care reimbursement claims for medical services rendered but not yet processed or paid 
the methodology by which each of these estimates has been determined for fiscal is consistent with the manner in which such estimates were made in prior years 
variances from estimate to the actual expense for these items in past years have not been significant 
although different assumptions about the factors affecting each of these estimates could produce a different amount of estimate  the reasonably determined range of estimates for each item would generally not be large enough to significantly change the overall company reported financial results 
contingencies the company is subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims arising in the normal conduct of its business 
in march  the company received notice of a class action complaint filed under the fair labor standards act by several former field sales representatives seeking overtime compensation for services rendered during their period of employment 
in january  the company received notice of an antitrust complaint concerning the alleged monopoly by operations of its becker cpa review corp 
subsidiary in california 
this complaint was filed in federal district court by the trustee in bankruptcy of a failed cpa review provider seeking a substantial amount of damages 
in april  this complaint was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice 
the complaint was amended and has subsequently been refiled 
in january  a graduate of one of devry university s los angeles area campuses filed a class action complaint on behalf of all students enrolled in the post baccalaureate degree program in information technology 
the suit alleges that the program offered by devry did not conform to the program as it was presented in the advertising and other marketing materials 
in november  three graduates of one of devry university s chicago area campuses filed a class action complaint that alleges devry graduates do not have appropriate skills for employability in the computer information systems field 
the complaint was subsequently dismissed by the court  but was amended and refiled  this time including a current student from a second chicago area campus 
the company has recorded approximately million associated with estimated loss contingencies at june  while the ultimate outcome of these contingencies is difficult to estimate at this time  the company does intend to vigorously defend itself with respect to these claims 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition  books and fees 
these payments include funds originating as student and family educational loans  other financial aid from various federal  state and provincial loan and grant programs  and student and family financial resources 
the pattern of cash receipts during the year is somewhat cyclical 
the level of accounts receivable from which payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  books and fees each semester 
at devry university  the undergraduate semesters begin in july  november and march 
collections of these receivables are heaviest during the first two months of each term  generally reaching of all collections for the term 
collections during this period exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period and generally provide sufficient cash flow for the balance of the semester s operations when collections are lower 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the undergraduate spring semester and the end of a financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
the graduate school has five term starts per year 
most of the professional and training segment operation has two term starts per year 
although their term start dates and frequency may be different  there are similar cyclical patterns in cash receipts based upon the respective academic term cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of related reserves  were approximately million  an increase of  compared to million last year 
although increased company revenues  up for the year  created higher receivables  collection performance and financial aid administration at devry university were improved during the year and resulted in a lesser rate of increase in total receivables 
reserves for uncollectible accounts for undergraduate student receivables were increased as a percentage of outstanding receivables to reflect the company s current collection experience on balances owed 
reserves for other uncollectible accounts were changed proportionately to the change in receivable levels 
to help further reduce the level of company provided interim student financing under the devry university undergraduate educard program  students at several of the us and canadian devry institutes participate in supplementary loan programs funded by private lenders 
the supplementary loans are aimed at students whose eligibility for federal and state funded financial aid is not sufficient to cover all their costs of education 
these loans are subject to a limited company default risk sharing agreement  and the company maintains reserves equal to the full extent of its share of the risk 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds at devry university in both the united states and canada 
the company estimates that historically  approximately of its undergraduate students tuition  book and fee revenues were financed by government provided financial aid to students 
keller graduate school collections from student participation in federal loan programs represent more than of keller revenues 
the financial aid and assistance programs in which the company s students participate are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained in the future 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
in april  the company received notice from the office of postsecondary education of the united states department of education of a limited scope program review of federally funded student financial assistance programs administered by the devry institutes 
this review was conducted in late may at the company s headquarters office 
the final report on this review was issued by the office of postsecondary education in june 
it included recommendations for process improvements but did not impose any monetary liability on the company 
such program reviews may be conducted at any educational institution at any time and have been conducted in the past at several devry campuses 
previous department of education program reviews at devry have not resulted in material findings or adjustments 
in conjunction with the required annual review procedures related to its administration of financial aid programs under the ontario student aid program  the toronto area devry campuses have engaged in discussions with the ontario ministry of education relating to certain additional information requirements 
these additional information requirements could serve as the basis for a ministry claim for the return of some amounts of financial aid disbursed to students attending these campuses 
discussion with the ministry continues as to the extent and purpose of the information requirements 
based upon its discussions to date  the company believes that its discussions with the ministry will be successfully concluded and that there will be no significant monetary liability 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from various state governments and the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
these funds are either received subsequent to the completion of the authorization and disbursement process for the benefit of the student or  in a lesser number of instances  just prior to that authorization 
once the authorization and disbursement process to the student has been completed  the funds are transferred to unrestricted accounts and these funds then become available for use by the company in current operations 
this process generally occurs within the period of the academic term for which such funds were authorized  with no academic term being more than weeks in length 
at june   cash in the amount of million was held in restricted bank accounts  in part  to provide funds for the final disbursements for the undergraduate spring term that ended in june and  in part  in anticipation of financial aid disbursements which occur at the start of the undergraduate summer term that began in july 
at june   cash in restricted bank accounts equaled million 
cash generated from operations in fiscal reached a new record of million  up more than from last year 
contributing to this increase in cash flow were the increased net income and the increased non cash charges for depreciation  tuition refunds and bad debt included in net income  a reduction in restricted cash balances and increases in accrued salaries and expenses  and increases in advanced tuition payments received from students 
capital expenditures in fiscal were a record million 
in just the past three years  the company has invested over million for expansion  facility improvement and replacement of school laboratories  and teaching and administrative equipment for its educational offerings 
contributing to the record capital spending in fiscal was the first quarter purchase of two devry university campuses  in pomona  california  and addison  illinois  both formerly occupied under operating leases 
theses purchases totaled million 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to decline somewhat from the record level in fiscal as new devry university campus openings in fiscal will be in leased facilities and  therefore  require less capital spending by the company 
although new campus openings planned for fiscal may be in company owned facilities  spending on these facilities will be spread over the end of fiscal and the start of fiscal and have a lesser effect on the level of capital expenditures in fiscal capital spending on improvements  including instructional technology  and expansion is an integral component of the company s operating strategy 
in december  the company and its banks amended the million revolving loan agreement under which the company has issued letters of credit and borrowed to meet cyclical operating requirements and for capital spending and acquisitions 
the term of the agreement was extended by one year to february  in addition  the covenant limiting capital expenditures was eliminated and the fixed charge covenant was modified to provide improved flexibility for the company s future operations 
at the end of fiscal  there were no borrowings under the revolving loan agreement except for approximately million in outstanding letters of credit issued primarily in conjunction with devry university s participation in student financial aid programs 
most of these letters of credit have expiration dates of less than one year 
to date  no amount has ever been drawn under any letter of credit issued on behalf of the company 
any amounts borrowed under the revolving loan agreement are payable at the expiration of the agreement in unless the agreement is extended to a later expiration date 
the company s interest rate on bank borrowings is a floating rate of prime or libor plus  at the company s option  and will remain at that level based on continued achievement of certain financial ratios 
interest rates are adjustable quarterly  based upon these financial ratios 
at the present time  the company does not have an interest rate swap or other form of protection against increases in the floating rate that would be applicable to future borrowings 
however  when the company does borrow  it fixes the interval of interest rate adjustment on most of its borrowings for various periods to eliminate some of the possible variability in rates 
the company periodically evaluates the need for interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates and borrowing levels 
the company s only long term contractual obligations consist of its revolving line of credit  operating leases on facilities and equipment and agreements for various services 
at june   there were no outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving loan agreement and required payments under non cancelable operating leases with a term in excess of one year are million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company is not a party to any off balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements nor are there any unconsolidated subsidiaries of the company 
there are no loans extended to any officer  director or other person affiliated with the company 
the company has not entered into any synthetic leases and there are no residual purchase or value commitments related to any facility lease 
the company has not entered into any derivative  swap  futures contract  put  call  hedge or non exchange traded contract 
the company does have over million in outstanding surety bonds to various governmental jurisdictions related primarily to its student recruiting and educational operations in those jurisdictions 
if the company were to fail to meet its obligations in these jurisdictions  it could be responsible for payment up to the amount of the bond issued to that jurisdiction 
to date  no surety bond has ever been paid in connection with the company failing to meet its obligations 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations is presented below dollars in thousands due in less than after total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating lease      other long term obligations total cash obligations      the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund both its current operations and its current growth plans for the foreseeable future
