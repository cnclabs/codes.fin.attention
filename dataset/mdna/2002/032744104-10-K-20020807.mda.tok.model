the following discussion  other than historical facts  contains forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company s results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company designs  develops  and markets integrated microwave components  assemblies  and subsystems for the wireless communications  satellite communications  and defense electronics markets 
the company uses its proprietary multi layer stripline technology to generate compact  lightweight  and cost effective products for use in these markets 
the company offers its integrated assemblies and high end subsystems to leading wireless communications equipment manufacturers such as ericsson  motorola  lucent technologies  and nortel networks and to satellite communications companies such as boeing  inc and lockheed martin 
the company operates predominantly in the wireless communications  satellite communications  and defense electronics markets 
the two reporting segments of the company are the wireless group and the space and defense group 
these groups have been determined based upon the nature of the products and services offered  customer base  technology  availability of discrete internal financial information  homogeneity of products  and delivery channel  and are consistent with the way the company organizes and evaluates financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
the company generally recognizes sales at the time products are shipped to customers  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or easily determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership of products are generally transferred at the time of shipment 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
a small percentage of sales are derived from long term fixed price contracts for the sale of large space and defense electronics products 
sales and estimated profits under long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a units of delivery basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes in sales value and costs at completion 
any losses on these contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
effective july   the company adopted financial accounting standard board fasb statement no 
business combinations and statement no 
goodwill and other intangibles 
as a result of the adoption of these new standards and in conjunction with the completion of goodwill impairment reviews by an outside appraisal firm  the company ceased amortization of the goodwill recorded as part of its previous acquisition transactions 
if the company had discontinued amortization of goodwill at the beginning of the first quarter of the prior fiscal year  net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share would have been increased by  or 
per share for the year ended june  on august   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of amitron  inc amitron is based in north andover  massachusetts and is primarily engaged in the design and manufacture of ceramic components and circuits for the medical  telecommunications and defense electronics markets 
the aggregate purchase consideration was  consisting of cash of  including cash direct acquisition costs  non cash direct acquisition costs in the form of stock options for service of  and  shares of the company s common stock with an aggregate value of  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
effective october  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of the m company europe  bv  a manufacturer of microwave circuits based in almelo  the netherlands 
the company s name was subsequently changed to anaren europe  bv anaren europe s manufacturing technology is similar to the company s multi layer stripline technology 
this manufacturing technology utilizes a unique metal backing technology which offers both cost and performance advantages for high power applications 
the aggregate purchase consideration for this transaction was  consisting of cash of  including direct acquisition costs  and company stock options with an aggregate fair value of  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
in january  anaren europe completed the reconstruction of its factory due to a fire in july  which partially destroyed this facility 
as of july  anaren europe s facility is fully operational and the company is actively engaged in rebuilding its customer base 
as a result of the fire  anaren europe received an insurance settlement through its property and business interruption insurance policies of approximately million in december to offset expenses incurred in out sourcing production  cleaning the facility and equipment and repairing equipment damaged but not destroyed in the fire  and to recognize the replacement cost to be received for inventory and equipment destroyed by the fire 
as a result of the fire and the subsequent insurance claim  the value of anaren europe s assets at the time of purchase was significantly higher than the consideration paid by anaren 
this situation resulted in significant negative goodwill being generated by the transaction  which  under current accounting convention  was first offset by writing down the acquired long lived assets to zero and then by recognizing an extraordinary gain of  or per share  in the second quarter ended december  in march  the company  through a newly created subsidiary  anaren communication suzhou co  ltd  signed a three year lease for a  square foot manufacturing facility in suzhou industrial park in suzhou  china 
the company has hired a general manager for the facility and additional staffing began in early july the company presently expects to begin light manufacturing and assembly at this location during the second quarter of fiscal it is anticipated that this facility will serve all of the company s asian customers and will concentrate on producing more labor intensive products 
additionally  it is expected that the company will use this location to facilitate procurement of raw materials in china  when possible  for the company s other subsidiaries 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring fire related total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense other  primarily interest income total other income income before income taxes and extraordinary item income taxes net income before extraordinary item extraordinary item gain on acquisition net income the following table sets forth the company s net sales by industry segment for the periods indicated years ended june  in thousands wireless    space defense    year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the previous year 
this decrease was caused by a drop in wireless sales  which was partially offset by a rise in sales of space and defense products 
the million decrease in sales of wireless products  which consist of standard surface mount components and custom subassemblies for use in building wireless base station equipment  was caused by a rapid downturn in capital expenditures for wireless infrastructure equipment which began in the latter part of fiscal this downturn resulted in numerous reductions in customer demand forecasts and delivery push outs beginning in march and continuing through fiscal this market downturn has affected all of the company s wireless product lines and has most severely affected sales of wireless standard components 
the downturn in wireless market sales was somewhat offset by the inclusion of million in sales in fiscal from anaren europe and amitron  the company s fiscal acquisitions 
although delivery push outs have stopped and the company saw a million increase in wireless sales from quarter two to quarters three and a million increase from quarter three to quarter four  the worldwide wireless market downturn is expected to continue for an uncertain period 
space and defense products consist of custom components and assemblies for communication satellites and defense radar countermeasures subsystems for the military 
sales in the space and defense group rose million  or  in fiscal  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase in shipments resulted from factory production shipments for the boeing spaceway program 
this satellite program  which entered full factory production in the fourth quarter of fiscal  is expected to place space and defense shipments in the million range  quarterly  through the remainder of calendar gross profit 
cost of sales consists primarily of engineering design costs  material  material fabrication costs  assembly costs and test costs 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  down from million of net sales for the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin resulted from the decline in sales volume  which caused under absorption of factory overhead compared to the previous year 
presently  the company expects gross margins to remain at or below current levels in fiscal and not to improve significantly without an increase in sales volume  both domestically and at anaren europe in the netherlands 
marketing 
marketing expenses consist mainly of employee related expenses  commissions paid to sales representatives  trade show expenses  advertising expenses and related travel expenses 
marketing expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal marketing expenses increased due to the addition of new east and west coast marketing offices and the additional marketing expenses associated with the company s acquired businesses  amitron and anaren europe  which amounted to approximately million in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses consist of material and salaries and related overhead costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities associated with new products and technology development 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures are supporting further development of wireless infrastructure products and new wireless networking product opportunities with a renewed emphasis on developing new standard surface mount wireless products 
despite the current wireless market downturn  the company does not expect to reduce its current research and development efforts in the near term and is presently working on a number of new standard wireless products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employee related expenses  professional services  goodwill in fiscal and intangible amortization  travel related expenses and other corporate costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal general and administrative expenses have decreased primarily due to the adoption of fasb statement no 
which eliminated the amortization of goodwill starting in the first quarter of fiscal the elimination of goodwill reduced general and administrative expenses by million in the current year compared to last year 
this elimination of goodwill amortization was partially offset by an increase in identifiable intangible amortization of  in fiscal associated with the company s acquisition of amitron 
additionally  general and administrative expense for fiscal includes ten months and nine of expense for amitron and anaren europe  respectively  which amounted to approximately million in the aggregate 
operating income 
operating income decreased million to an operating loss of  of net sales for fiscal  from an operating profit of million of net sales for fiscal on a reporting segment basis  the wireless operating loss was million for fiscal  down or million from million operating income in fiscal the principal reason for the decrease in wireless operating income in fiscal compared to fiscal was the decrease in wireless sales year over year due to the large decrease in wireless base station equipment demand worldwide  which began in the last half of fiscal and continues at the present time 
the large decline in sales levels in the wireless segment resulted in significant under absorption of fixed overhead within the group during the current fiscal year 
additionally  operating income in the wireless sector was further decreased by the million operating loss at anaren europe in fiscal due to the fire recovery costs and the low level of sales caused by the fire 
space and defense operating income rose million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted from a million rise in space and defense revenues year over year  due to the spaceway program entering full production at the end of fiscal year this increase in revenue resulted in better absorption of fixed overhead in fiscal compared to the previous year 
additionally  cost reduction and efficiency efforts in this segment were successful in reducing the overall cost of operations in fiscal compared to the prior year 
other income 
other income is primarily interest income received on invested cash balances and income from debt extinguishment due to leased equipment destroyed in the anaren europe july fire 
other income decreased to million of net sales for the year ended june  from million of net sales for the same period last year 
this decrease was caused mainly by the decline in market interest rates over the last months brought about by reductions in the federal fund rates  and the use of approximately million in cash to complete the acquisitions of amitron and anaren europe 
interest income will fluctuate based on the level of interest rates and the level of investible cash balances 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an other income item amounting to approximately  representing the remaining principal balance on a capitalized lease obligation which was no longer payable by the company 
the equipment leased by the company was destroyed in the july fire 
interest expense interest expense primarily represents loan interest  commitment fees and interest incurred on certain deferred obligations 
interest expense for fiscal was  of net sales compared to  of net sales for fiscal income taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal was  of net sales 
this compared to tax expense of million of net sales for fiscal  representing an effective tax rate of 
during the fourth quarter  the company finalized an analysis of certain available research credits and export tax benefits and recorded a tax benefit of  in addition  the company s effective tax rate decreased as a direct result of the increased proportion of federally exempt state municipal bond income in relation to income before taxes 
going forward the company s effective tax rate will be impacted by the levels of tax credits  export tax benefits  nontaxable interest income and the income loss generated by the foreign subsidiaries in relation to income before taxes 
extraordinary gain 
the extraordinary gain in fiscal of million of net sales resulted from the purchase of anaren europe 
as a result of the fire and the subsequent insurance settlement  the value of the anaren europe assets at the time of purchase was significantly higher than the consideration paid by anaren 
this situation resulted in significant negative goodwill being generated by the transaction  which  under current accounting convention  was first offset by writing down the acquired fixed assets to zero and then by recognizing an extraordinary gain of  or per share  in the second quarter of fiscal year ended june  fiscal compared to year ended june  fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million  up over net sales of million in fiscal the increase was the result of a rise in wireless sales and an increase in shipments of space and defense products 
the increase in the sale of wireless products amounted to million and reflects mainly the addition of sales the company s two acquisitions  anaren power products and rf power  whose combined sales were million for fiscal wireless product sales growth  after adjusting for these acquisitions  was approximately  or million  in fiscal compared to the prior year sales 
during the latter part of fiscal  the company saw a rapid downturn in expenditures for capital infrastructure by service providers 
this resulted in an increasing number of reductions in customer demand forecasts and delivery pushouts beginning toward the end of february and continuing through june this severe market downturn had a negative impact on all of the company s wireless product lines that continues at present 
sales in the space and defense group rose million  or  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this small increase in shipments resulted from the first pre production engineering hardware shipments and initial production shipments for the boeing spaceway program 
this program  which had been in an engineering design phase for the preceding year and a half  entered full factory production in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  up million from million of net sales for fiscal gross profit increased significantly due to the absolute increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the rise in sales volume did not result in further improvement in gross margin as a percent of sales  year over year  as the gross margin at the company s new subsidiaries  which provided the majority of the fiscal sales growth  were below those of its main plant operations in east syracuse  new york 
additionally  gross profit improvement was further hindered by the decline in shipments in the second half of fiscal due to the downturn in capital spending for wireless infrastructure equipment 
in light of the lower sales levels  the company took action to consolidate its operations  reduced its personnel levels by over from their peak in february  and decreased other indirect costs 
marketing 
marketing expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal this increase was a result of the continuing expansion of the marketing and sales organization to support the company s expanding commercial markets  as well as eleven and eight months of expense for anaren power products and rf power  respectively  not included in fiscal expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures expanded to support further development of wireless infrastructure products and new broadband fixed wireless product opportunities 
the inclusion of anaren power products and rf power in the company s research and development expense in fiscal accounted for approximately  in additional expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal from million of net sales for fiscal general and administrative expenses increased due to the hiring of additional personnel to support the company s corporate acquisition activity  a rise in professional fees due to the company s growth  and amortization of goodwill expense related to acquisitions 
additionally  the fiscal expense includes and eight months general and administrative expense for anaren power products and rf power  respectively  not included in fiscal restructuring 
restructuring expense consists of severance pay  vacation pay  abandoned equipment and leasehold impairment charges and accrued noncancellable lease obligation expenses related to the closure of anaren power products new jersey facility and relocation of its operations to east syracuse  new york 
restructuring expenses were  of net sales in fiscal compared to no restructuring expense in fiscal operating income 
operating income increased to million of net sales for fiscal  compared to million of net sales for fiscal on a reporting segment basis wireless operating income was million for fiscal  down from million for fiscal the main reason for the decline in wireless operating income was the sudden drop in worldwide demand for wireless infrastructure equipment which resulted in a severe decline in company wireless sales in the latter part of fiscal these significantly lower sales levels  coupled with the restructuring charge related to the closing of anaren power products new jersey facility and relocation of its ferrite production to the company s east syracuse  new york facility  caused steep declines in wireless operating income which culminated in a wireless operating loss in the fourth quarter 
space and defense operating income rose to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this increase resulted from a million rise in revenue for this segment in fiscal  as well as a much more profitable product mix for fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year which allowed the company to ship more product with a lower head count within the segment 
interest expense

critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments management uses in applying the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in the company s financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of anaren s financial condition and results  and requires management to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill and intangibles  and accounting for income taxes  which impacts valuation allowance and the effective tax rate 
management reviews the estimates  including  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income tax valuations on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market  using a standard cost methodology to determine the cost basis for the inventory 
this method approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
the recoverability of inventories is based on the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
the company s accounts receivable represent those amounts  which have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
the company analyzes various factors including historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is established based on the portion of those accounts receivable which are deemed to be potentially uncollectible 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company evaluates the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and adjust as needed 
these adjustments  when made  would have an impact on the company s financial statements in the period that they were recorded 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment by the company at the reporting unit level  by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
valuation methods for determining the fair value of the reporting unit include reviewing quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired the fair value of the reporting units is less than the carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill and  if it is less  the company would then recognize an impairment loss 
the projection of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in changes in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the years ended june  and were million and million  respectively 
the positive cash flow from operations in both fiscal and was due to the net income attained in both years and  in fiscal  to the large amount of cash received in the second and third quarters million from the anaren europe insurance settlement

additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  million was used to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the purchases were made under a million share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors 
no repurchases of the company s shares took place in fiscal the company has a credit facility providing an unsecured million working capital revolving line of credit bearing interest at the libor interest rate plus one hundred twenty five basis points and maturing december  the terms of the credit facility require maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth  ratio of cash flows to maturities  and leverage ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement 
the company believes that it was in compliance with all restrictions and covenants at june  at june   was outstanding under the credit facility 
the company believes that its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by currently invested cash balances  expected cash flows from operations  and funds available under the credit facility

 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas is required for adoption for fiscal years beginning after may   with early adoption of the provisions related to the rescission of statement encouraged 
the company has reviewed the provisions of sfas  and believes that upon adoption  the statements will not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for restructuring costs sfas 
sfas applies to costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
under sfas  a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
sfas will require a company to disclose information about its exit and disposal activities  the related costs  and changes in those costs in the notes to the interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit activity is initiated and in any subsequent period until the activity is completed 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
under sfas  a company may not restate its previously issued financial statements and the new statement grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that a company had previously recorded under eitf issue quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s possible exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of june   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  of which approximately million consisted of highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities and million consisted of marketable equity securities 
the marketable debt securities at date of purchase normally have maturities between one and months  are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rate of from june  rates  or  would have reduced net income and cash flow by approximately  or per share for the year 
due to the relatively short maturities of the securities and its ability to hold those investments to maturity  the company does not believe that an immediate decrease in interest rates would have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
over time  however  declines in interest rates will reduce the company s interest income 
the company currently owns equity investments held for sale with a market value of approximately million 
fluctuations in market value of these securities are charged to stockholders equity monthly 
a theoretical decline in market value of these securities would result in a  reduction in stockholders equity 
all of the company s sales from its domestic us subsidiaries to foreign customers are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly are not exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
sales of the company s netherlands subsidiary  anaren europe  are denominated in euros to european customers and united states dollars to us customers 
sales to us customers by anaren europe denominated in united states dollars would be subject to currency exchange losses 
at present  due to the fire at anaren europe  sales of that subsidiary to us customers in us dollars subject to possible currency losses are less than  per quarter and thus any possible losses due to currency fluctuations would not be material to the operating results of the company until such time as anaren europe s sales increase significantly
