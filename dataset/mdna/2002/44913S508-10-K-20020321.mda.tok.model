the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilites at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and software development costs we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company assesses the recoverability of its software development costs against estimated future revenue over the estimated remaining economic life of the software

effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
sfas also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of sfas are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  sfas is required to be applied at the beginning of an entity s fiscal year and to be applied to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in its financial statements at that date 
in  sfas no 
became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately  of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately  of amortization expense on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets sfas 
the new standard supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas  the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the new standard also supercedes the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period s in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements beginning after december   but allow for early application 
the provisions of sfas generally are to be applied prospectively  therefore  the adoption of this standard will not affect previously reported financial information 
management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
other we do not believe general inflation materially impacts our sales and operating results 
we do not expect that current tax legislation will significantly affect our future financial position  liquidity or operating results 
at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes and approximately  for the alternative minimum tax 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not previously utilized  as follows      and thereafter  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pcquote has a promissory note  at december  that has an interest rate equal to the prime rate announced in the wall street journal 
we are exposed to market risk as the prime rate is subject to fluctuations in the market 
we do not believe the market risk is material to our financial statements 
at december   we had excess cash invested in a money market account 
we do not expect any material loss  if at all  on this investment
