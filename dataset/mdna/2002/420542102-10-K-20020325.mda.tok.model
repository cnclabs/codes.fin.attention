table of contents item legal proceedings litigation in january  the court confirmed the settlement of the construction defect case entitled marine village townhomes homeowners association v 
hawthorne savings and loan association in which the bank was a defendant 
the terms of the settlement are confidential  but the settlement did not have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
in april  the superior court of the state of california  county of los angeles granted plaintiff s motion to reinstate a construction defect case entitled stone water terrace hoa v 
hawthorne savings and loan association  in which the bank was named as a defendant 
the case had previously been dismissed because plaintiff failed to take certain actions to prosecute its case 
in this action  plaintiff alleges  under several theories of recovery  that the bank is responsible for construction defects in a multi unit condominium complex 
the bank initially provided construction loans to the developer  but took over the completion of a portion of the project after the developer defaulted 
plaintiff seeks damages in an unspecified amount  plus punitive damages 
the bank denies the allegations in the complaint and has cross complained against all of the subcontractors for indemnity 
discovery has not commenced  but plaintiffs have indicated that damages may exceed  although the bank intends to vigorously defend its position in these actions and to seek indemnification from the responsible parties  there can be no assurances that the company will prevail 
in addition  the inherent uncertainty of jury or judicial verdicts makes it impossible to determine with certainty the company s maximum exposure in this action  although based upon the information developed to date  the company believes its exposure will not exceed the amounts indicated by plaintiffs 
however  it is probable that the company will incur substantial legal fees defending this matter 
the company is involved in a variety of other litigation matters in the ordinary course of its business  and anticipates that it will become involved in new litigation matters from time to time in the future 
based on the current assessment of these other matters  management does not presently believe that any one of these existing other matters is likely to have material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  result of operations or cash flows 
however  the company will incur legal and related costs concerning the litigation and may from time to time determine to settle some or all of the cases  regardless of management s assessment of the company s legal position 
the amount of legal defense costs and settlements in any period will depend on many factors  including the status of cases and the number of cases that are in trial or about to be brought to trial and the opposing parties aggressiveness in pursuing their cases and their perception of their legal position 
further  the inherent uncertainty of jury or judicial verdicts makes it impossible to determine with certainty the company s maximum cost in any pending litigation 
accordingly  the company s litigation costs and expenses may vary materially from period to period  and no assurance can be given that these costs will not be material in any particular period

dividends it is the present policy of the company to retain earnings to provide funds for use in its business 
the company has not paid cash dividends on the common stock during the past several years and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
as a holding company whose only significant asset is the common stock of the bank  the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and to conduct business activities directly or in non banking subsidiaries depends significantly on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from the bank 
federal banking laws and regulations  including the regulations of the ots  limit the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company 
the bank generally may not declare dividends or make any other capital distribution to the company if  after the payment of such dividends or other distribution  the bank would fall within any of the three undercapitalized categories under the prompt corrective action standards established by the ots and the other federal banking agencies 
another regulation of the ots also limits the company s ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions in a manner that depends upon the extent to which it meets regulatory capital requirements 
in addition  hola generally requires savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company to give the ots at least days advance notice of any proposed dividends to be made on its guarantee  permanent or other non withdrawable stock or else the dividend will be invalid 
see item business regulation of the bank capital distribution limitations 
further  the ots may prohibit any dividend or other capital distribution that it determines would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition to the regulation of dividends and other capital distributions  there are various statutory and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the bank can finance or otherwise transfer funds to the company or any of its non banking subsidiaries  whether in the form of loans  extensions of credit  investments or asset purchases 
the director of the ots may further restrict these transactions in the interest of safety and soundness

critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  and the newly released ffiec guidelines  management establishes specific allowances for credit losses on individual loans when it has determined that recovery of the company s gross investment is not probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably determined 
on a quarterly basis  management completes a loan loss allowance analysis that provides for an adequate balance in the allowance for credit losses 
management evaluates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with gaap  within the guidance established by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as standards established by regulatory interagency policy statements on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll 
during the fourth quarter of  management enhanced the methodology in determining the allowance for credit losses 
the most significant change to the alll methodology was related to the qualitative adjustments to the individual loan types  based on the current local and national economic conditions  which was previously included in the unallocated allowance 
in addition  adjustments were also made to changes in internal policies and industry conditions 
these changes included development of a risk based pricing matrix  driven by risk factors such as collateral quality  debt coverage ratio dcr  recourse  etc  implementation of more conservative advance rates for land draws  requiring higher minimum equity contributions  enhanced underwriting of borrower cash flow on sfr construction loans  reduced ltv maximum for land loans  and  with respect to consumer related loans  a small upward adjustment was made due to the relative newness of the overdraft protection product and the lack of seasoning to validate the existing underwriting model 
in accordance with accounting and regulatory issuance  the company s methodology is summarized as follows the management separates loans into pools by loan type and risk factor ie loan grade 
the grading system is designed to evaluate risk 
loan grading provides management with information regarding actual or potential loan problems and provides a basis for establishing action plans to strengthen credits 
management segments its portfolio into pools with similar characteristics  based on loan type collateral driven and risk factor loan grade 
currently  the portfolio is segmented into nine categories by collateral type  further stratified by loan grade pass grades  special mention and substandard 
the general pool categories are sfr greater than million  sfr less than million  multi family  commercial real estate permanent  commercial other  commercial construction  sfr construction  land  and  consumer 
the originating unit is responsible for classifying each new and renewed loan in accordance with the bank s asset classification system policy 
the bank s portfolio managers and asset managers  under the direction of their supervisors  are responsible for ensuring that all loans under their responsibility are appropriately graded 
the respective managers analyze any and all new information on borrowers  including updated financial statements  payment performance  random inspection of collateral  updated credit reports  and determine if such information affects the loan grade 
in addition  the bank s internal credit review staff is 
table of contents responsible for monitoring existing loan grades and continually assessing the accuracy of assigned grades 
periodically  the loan classifications are evaluated for appropriateness by an independent third party loan review firm 
the primary factors used in assigning loan grades include capacity and willingness of borrower guarantor to service debt considering current financial data  cash flow of collateral property and ability to service existing debts  alternate source of repayment  trade and bank payment history  effects of current and anticipated market and economic conditions  impact of interest rate fluctuations  collateral value and the borrower s ability to refinance collateral based on current value  property tax status  payment status  status of insurance and taxes  and  existence of other liens 
in general  pass graded assets are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower  or by the value of the asset or underlying collateral 
pass graded assets are of the highest quality and reflect risk similar to that of cash secured assets  with very strong cash flow  underlying credit of a or superior quality  ltv ratios of approximately or less 
pass graded assets have minimum risk  exhibit a satisfactory repayment program  are secured by excellent collateral and have ltv ratios of or less  income property loans require a or superior quality collateral  must be above minimum debt service coverage requirements or reflect strong cash flow positions 
pass graded assets include average risk with nominal loss potential satisfactory for their size  are supported by repayment history and or net worth reflected by satisfactory financial statements 
special mention  grade  assets have potential weaknesses that require close monitoring by management 
assets included in this category include loans that have developed credit weaknesses since origination 
this loan grade includes loans that the bank is unable to properly supervise because of an inadequate control over collateral  an adverse trend in the borrower s operations  or a highly leveraged position reflected in the borrower s balance sheet 
if either condition has deteriorated to the point that timely repayment is jeopardized  an adverse classification may be required 
if the only weakness is credit data or collateral documentation exceptions that are not material to the timely repayment of the asset  it may not necessarily be graded as special mention 
substandard  grade  assets have a well defined weakness  which are characterized by the potential loss to the bank if the deficiencies are not corrected 
such assets are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or by the collateral pledged  if any 
these assets may be characterized by one  or a combination of the following weaknesses primary source of repayment is gone or severely impaired and the bank may have to rely upon the secondary source  but sufficient problems have arisen to cause the bank to go to abnormal lengths to protect its position in order to maintain a high probability of repayment  the borrower is unable to generate enough cash flow to reduce their debts  deterioration in collateral value or inadequate inspection or verification of value if collateral is expected to be the source of repayment  and  flaws in documentation leaving the bank in a subordinated or unsecured position when the collateral is needed for repayment of the loan 
the presence of one or more of these factors does not mandate that the asset be adversely classified if  based on the judgment of management  the presence of such factors does not indicate a weakness that jeopardizes the timely liquidation of the asset  or disposition of the collateral at book value 
substandard  grade  assets display weaknesses described above under grade  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection  or liquidation of the asset in full  questionable 
these loans are typically on nonaccrual status and may have identifiable loss exposure  such as a high ltv ratio  and collateral that does not appear to be sufficient to provide full collection of principal upon liquidation of the asset 
these assets are generally considered impaired under sfas no 
and a specific valuation allowance sva may be established 
management applies adjusted loss rates to pools of loans pool rates 
pool rates are established by examining historical charge off data for groups of loans and adjusting them for a variety of qualitative factors that could affect future loss rates 
where the bank has no or nominal actual charge off data for certain loan types  industry data and management s judgment is utilized as representative starting loss rates 
the following qualitative factors are considered trends in past due and impaired loans  trends in charge offs and recoveries  
table of contents trends in loan volume and loan terms  changes in credit policies and underwriting  experience and the ability of lending management and staff  external factors including national and local economic trends and conditions  duration of the current business cycle  competition  legal and regulatory requirements  as well as potential events that may affect collectibility of loans  industry conditions  and  concentration of credit risk 
adjustments to loss rates are considered for any qualitative factor deemed appropriate by management and may be upward or downward 
management s analysis of historical loss data in determining the initial loss rates for various loan pools is summarized as follows for pass graded pools  management calculated a loss rate based on actual aggregate losses by loan 
management utilized loss rates experienced by peers or industry average data for loan types for which the bank had no actual losses over the period analyzed 
since special mention assets reflect greater risk of loss than pass graded assets  management used of the substandard loss rate  derived for each loan type  as the special mention loss rate 
this estimate is representative of loss rates utilized by other institutions  both in terms of their loss experiences and as a reasonable industry standard rate  when loss data is not available 
for substandard graded pools  management evaluated loss data over the last three years  calculating the percentage of the aggregate balance of substandard loans in each pool migrated to loss over this period 
for loan types for which the bank did not experience losses in substandard pools  management utilized the highest annual loss rate experienced in the last three years for the overall substandard portfolio 
in some cases  where this average did not appear reflective of the level of risk associated with the loan type  management used an industry standard loss rate 
in  management may opt to utilize quarterly average outstanding balances in determining loss rates  which may result in slightly different loss rate calculations 
management analyzes significant problem assets for specific loss exposure and establishes svas as needed 
sfas no 
defines loan impairment as the existence of uncertainty concerning collection of all principal and interest per the contractual terms of a loan 
nonaccrual loans and loans which are considered troubled debt restructures are typically impaired and analyzed individually for svas 
for collateral dependent loans  impairment is typically considered measured by comparing the loan amount to the fair value of collateral determined via appraisals and or internal valuations  less costs to sell  with a sva established for the shortfall amount 
other methods can be used to estimate impairment market price or present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original interest rate 
currently  million in svas have been established for two loans 
management performs additional analyses to validate the reasonableness of the estimate of credit losses 
the estimated general valuation allowance gva level  based on the ots examiner benchmark and review of peer information  was used to establish a range between million and million 
the bank s gva balance of million falls within this range  which further supports the reasonableness of the bank s gva balance at december  the gva includes an unallocated amount 
the unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated allowance include other general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas 
management believes that the provision for credit losses was at an adequate level during and that the allowance for credit losses of million at december   is adequate to absorb the losses that  in the opinion and judgment of management  are known and inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
nonaccrual loans the company generally ceases to accrue interest on any loan with respect to which the loan s contractual payments are more than days delinquent  as well as loans classified substandard for which interest payment 
table of contents reserves were established from loan funds rather than borrower funds 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan for which management has determined that collection of the company s investment in the loan is not reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms for a period  typically between three to six months  and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
real estate owned properties acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure real estate owned  are transferred to reo and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the reo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less costs to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  construction and renovation costs  marketing and transaction costs and holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the reo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
revenue recognition upon disposition of the property is dependent upon the sale having met certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial investment in the property sold 
gains and losses from sales of real estate owned properties are reflected in income loss from real estate operations  net in the consolidated statements of income 
results of operations compared with general net income for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share before extraordinary item and million  or per diluted share after extraordinary item  an increase of over net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in net income for the year ended december   resulted in a return on average assets roa of and a return on average equity roe of  compared with a roa of and a roe for the year ended december  income before income taxes and extraordinary item increased  for the year ended december   to million from million in the extraordinary item  net of tax  of million for the year ended december   was due to the acceleration of the amortization of million in prepaid offering costs and million in premium paid in conjunction with the repurchase of million of senior notes during the year 
the company s net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to million during the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the company s net interest income was impacted by a basis point drop in interest rates during the resulting historically low interest rate environment produced compression in the net interest margin during the first half of the year due to the immediate repricing of adjustable rate assets and the lag in liability repricing resulting from the six month weighted average maturity of certificates of deposits 
the company s yield on average earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in contributing to the increase in year over year interest revenues on loans was a million  or  decrease in nonaccrual loans 
the average cost of funds for the company decreased to during the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the company s resulting net interest margin for the year ended december   was  compared with during the same period in although the year over year net interest margin declined  the company has shown continuous improvement in this area  with the net interest margin increasing to during the fourth quarter of  from during the first and second quarters of  and during the third quarter of as of december   of the company s loan portfolio 
table of contents was tied to adjustable rate indices  such as cofi  prime  cmt  mta and libor 
out of these adjustable rate loans  approximately  or billion  have reached their internal interest rate floors 
therefore  these loans have taken on fixed rate characteristics  while the majority of the company s deposits have a six month average life 
provision for credit losses totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for credit losses was due to improvement in asset quality

the operations of the company are substantially dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned from its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest margin is its net interest income divided by its average interest earning assets 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors  including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between the repricing or maturity of the company s adjustable rate and fixed rate loans and short term investment securities and its deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of the company s noninterest earning assets  including nonaccrual loans and reo 
the company s net interest income increased to million during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  average earning assets increased to billion for the year ended december   compared with billion for the year ended december  due to the historically low interest rate environment in  which has continued into  prepayment speeds continue to increase

the yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in contributing to the increase in year over year interest revenues on loans was a million  or  decrease in nonaccrual loans 
the steady growth in loans was funded through borrowings from the fhlb 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company decreased to for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets  the company s resulting net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in current year earnings were impacted by the basis point drop in interest rates during the resulting interest rate environment caused compression in the net interest margin during the first half of the year due to the immediate repricing of adjustable rate assets and the lag in liability repricing resulting from the six month weighted average maturity of certificates of deposits 
the substantial majority of the company s earning assets principally loans are adjustable rate 
the company s deposits are primarily comprised of term certificate accounts  which carry fixed interest rates and predominantly possess original terms ranging from six to twelve months 
the company s borrowings  which are principally derived from the fhlb  are for terms ranging from one to ten years though such terms are subject to certain early call provisions and carry both variable and fixed interest rates 
as of december   of the company s net loan portfolio was adjustable rate  with of such loans subject to repricing no less frequently than annually 
the substantial majority of such loans are priced at a margin over various market sensitive indices  including the mta  the prime rate  libor  cofi  one year cmt and the one month cmt 
as of december   billion  or  of the company s adjustable rate net loan portfolio had reached internal interest rate floors 
these loans will take on fixed rate repricing characteristics until sufficient upward interest rate movements will bring the fully indexed rate above their internal interest rate floors 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging twelve months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated ten months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
the compression in the net interest margin during was due to the rapid decline in interest rates 
since the majority of the certificate of deposit accounts have repriced at least once to current lower rates  the company expects that the cost of these accounts will stabilize in however  small upward interest rate adjustments over an extended period of time could have an adverse impact on the net interest margin due to the fixed rate repricing characteristics of the loan portfolio previously discussed 
as of december   of the company s borrowings from the fhlb are fixed rate  with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years though such remaining terms are subject to early call provisions 
the remaining of the borrowings carry an adjustable interest rate  with of the adjustable borrowings tied to the prime rate  maturing in february the remaining is tied to one month libor  and matures in may accordingly  the continued decrease in market interest rates has resulted in a gradual decrease in the cost of the company s fhlb borrowings  and the cost of any newly acquired borrowings will reflect current market pricing

the calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  and therefore the requisite amount of provision for credit losses  is based on several factors  including underlying loan collateral values  delinquency trends and historical loan loss experience  as discussed herein  all of which can change without notice based on market and economic conditions and other factors

interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
please refer to item business  loan portfolio  for a thorough discussion of the company s lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon the company s net interest income nii and theoretical liquidation value  also referred to as net portfolio value npv 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
changes in the nii the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
table of contents are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest incurred on deposits and borrowings 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of the company s loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices  such as cofi  prime  cmt  mta and libor 
as of december   billion  or  of the company s adjustable rate net loan portfolio had reached their internal interest rate floors 
these loans will take on fixed rate repricing characteristics until sufficient upward interest rate movements will bring the fully indexed rate above their internal interest rate floors 
the majority of the company s deposits are time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of the company s borrowings from the fhlb are fixed rate  with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years though such remaining terms are subject to early call provisions 
the remaining of the borrowings carry an adjustable interest rate  with of the adjustable borrowings tied to the prime rate  maturing in february changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect the company s interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the company s assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize the company s nii and npv by matching its rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  the nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing of assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on the company s nii and npv  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime internal interest rate caps and floors 
the benefit of the bank s asset sensitive balance sheet will be partially negated by the billion in loans that have reached contractual floors that will not immediately reprice upwards 
these adjustable loans have taken on fixed rate loan characteristics and will not reprice until rates have increased enough to bring the fully indexed rate above the internal floor rate 
the company utilizes two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest rate simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  particularly the one year maturity horizon 
interest rate simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the company s financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
interest rate simulations provide the company with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
normally  all assets and liabilities are subjected to tests of up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments 
under each interest 
table of contents rate scenario  the company projects its net interest income and the npv of its current balance sheet 
from these results  the company can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
with the sharp decline in interest rates during  the rate shock scenarios for a decrease in rates became unpredictable 
many of the current deposit rates and market indices such as libor were below 
as a result  a rate shock down of or even basis points was not possible 
with concurrence from the ots  for december   rate shocks were performed for  and basis points up  and basis points down 
since  the company has been utilizing internal interest rate floors on individual loans held for investment  to mitigate the risk of interest margin compression in a decreasing rate environment 
additionally  on most new income property loans  the company utilizes internal interest rate caps on individual loans held for investment 
these are life caps and are usually three points above the rate at underwriting or at an amount that would still allow for one to one debt service coverage at the maximum rate  thereby reducing the likelihood of borrower default in a rising rate environment 
the risk to the company associated with the internal interest rate floors is that interest rates may decline  and the borrower may choose to refinance the loan  either with the company or with another financial institution  resulting in the company having to replace the higher yielding asset at a lower rate 
due to the interest rate environment  which has continued into  prepayment speeds continue to increase 
if this trend continues  it could negatively impact growth in interest earning assets  which in turn could negatively impact net income and operational efficiency 
the company is also exposed to risks associated with interest rate caps in that interest rates could exceed the maximum rates on such loans  and while the company s cost of funds would continue to rise  the interest income derived from these loans would be fixed  resulting in an overall compression on net interest income 
a traditional  although analytically limited measure  of a financial institution s irr is the static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
however  because a portion of the indices that the company s loan products are priced to may lag changes in market interest rates by three months or more  the company s net interest income may not reflect changes in interest rates immediately 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging twelve months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated five months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
the company saw compression in the net interest margin during due to the rapid decline in interest rates 
now that the majority of the certificate accounts have repriced at least once to current  lower rates  the company expects that the cost of its certificate accounts will stabilize in the coming months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability mix to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the company s income to the extent that the interest rates borne by the assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor its interest rate risk exposure 
as a part of this effort  the company uses the npv methodology to gauge irr exposure 
using an internally generated model  the company monitors interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the discounted present value of the difference 
table of contents between incoming cashflows on interest earning assets and other assets  and the outgoing cashflows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the npv ratio is defined as the npv for a given rate scenario divided by the market value of the assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  whichever produces the largest decline 
by agreement with the ots  the downward rate shock was performed for basis points down only  due to the overall compression of rates 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure  the greater is considered its exposure to irr 
the ots also produces a similar analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial report tfr 
at december   based on the company s internally generated model  it was estimated that the company s npv ratio was in the event of a basis point increase in rates  a decrease of from basecase of 
if rates were to decrease by basis points  the company s npv ratio was estimated at  an increase of from basecase 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the company s irr as measured in the npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of   and basis point increments in market interest rates 
net portfolio value change change from change from in rates amount basecase ratio basecase dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp n a n a n a n a bp n a n a n a n a management believes that the npv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected cash flows  weighing each by its appropriate discount factor 
second  because the npv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an association s irr exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
on a quarterly basis  the results of the internally generated model are reconciled to the results of the ots model 
historically the ots has valued the npv higher  but the changes in npv as a result of the rate increases and decreases are normally directionally consistent between the two models 
the difference between the two models resides in the prepayment assumptions  the ability of the company to analyze each individual rate index in a changing environment  and the ability of the company s model to include internal caps and floors on loans in the rate shock analyses 
through the inclusion of more specific information regarding the company s unique loan portfolio  the internal model reflects greater sensitivity in both a rising and a declining rate environment 
based on both the company s model and the regulatory model  in accordance with the ots guideline s interest rate sensitivity measure  the company falls within the ots minimal risk category
