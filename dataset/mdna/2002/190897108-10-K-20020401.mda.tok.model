item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we completed our initial public offering of our common stock in june we sold a total of  shares of common stock at per share yielding net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting commissions and other expenses 
on june   we issued year capital trust preferred securities in the aggregate amount of  the trust preferred securities bear a cumulative fixed interest rate of per annum and mature on june  interest distributions are payable quarterly 
we may defer the payment of interest at any time for a period not exceeding consecutive quarters provided that the deferral period does not extend past the stated maturity 
during any such deferral period  our ability to pay dividends on our common shares will be restricted 
subject to approval by the frb  the trust preferred securities may be redeemed prior to maturity at our option on or after june  portions of the trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital under regulatory definitions 
issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and professional fees of approximately million were deferred and are being amortized over five years to noninterest expense using the straight line method 
on march   we completed our acquisition of milek insurance services  inc the agency  which was renamed cobiz insurance  inc  provides commercial and personal property and casualty insurance brokerage  as well as risk management consulting services to small and medium sized businesses and individuals 
the shareholders of milek received  shares of cobiz common stock as consideration for the acquisition 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
under this method of accounting  the recorded assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  income and expenses of cobiz and milek have been combined and reflected at their historical amounts 
on march   we completed the acquisition of first capital bank of arizona 
first capital was an arizona state chartered commercial bank with two locations serving phoenix and the surrounding area of maricopa county  arizona 
as a result of the merger  each outstanding share of first capital common stock was converted into shares of cobiz common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of cobiz common stock to the former first capital shareholders 
in addition  cobiz assumed approximately  options that had been issued to first capital employees 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
under this method of accounting  the recorded assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  income and expenses of cobiz and first capital have been combined and reflected at their historical amounts 
on march   the bank acquired of the outstanding common stock of colorado business leasing  inc leasing held by minority stockholders  thereby making leasing a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank 
on july   we acquired green manning bunch  ltd  a year old investment banking firm based in denver  colorado 
the acquisition of gmb  which is a limited partnership  was completed through a wholly owned subsidiary that we formed in order to consummate the transaction cobiz gmb  inc in the acquisition  i the corporate general partner of gmb was merged into cobiz gmb  inc  with the shareholders of the general partner receiving  in cash   shares of our common stock  and the right to receive future earn out payments  and ii cobiz gmb  inc acquired all of the limited partnership interests of gmb in exchange for  in cash  shares of cobiz gmb  inc class b common stock the cobiz gmb  inc shares and the right to receive future earn out payments 
the cobiz gmb  inc shares represent a interest in cobiz gmb  inc and have no voting rights 
after two years  or sooner under certain circumstances  the holders of the cobiz gmb  inc shares have the right to require us to exchange the cobiz gmb  inc shares for  shares of our common stock 
after three years  or sooner under certain circumstances  we can require the holders of the cobiz gmb  inc shares to exchange such shares for  shares of our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
goodwill of  was recorded in connection with the transaction 
the contingent consideration resulting from the earn out payments will be treated as an additional cost of the acquisition and recorded as goodwill 
our management has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects 
as a result  relatively high levels of noninterest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of options to purchase common stock to many employees  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
while we will continue to add personnel to lead new growth initiatives  including middle management  we believe our senior management and systems infrastructure are adequate to support our anticipated growth without incurring proportionate increases in general  administrative and other noninterest expenses 
from december  to december   our shareholders equity increased  from million to million 
during that same time period  our outstanding loans and leases net increased  from million to million 
this increase has primarily been the result of our focus on local relationship banking and commercial lending to small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals 
in addition  we have emphasized building and maintaining asset quality through our credit underwriting and monitoring process 
nonperforming assets have ranged from to of total assets during this period 
we have maintained asset quality  while continuing to build our allowance for loan and lease losses 
our allowance for loan and lease losses increased  from million as of december  to million as of december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a description of our accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as indicated above  the acquisition of milek insurance services  inc and first capital bank of arizona were accounted for as poolings of interests 
accordingly  the company s financial statements for all years presented in this report give retroactive effect to those acquisitions and combine the assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  income and expenses of cobiz and the acquired entities at all dates and for all periods covered by the financial statements 
all of the comparative information contained in the following sections of this report also gives retroactive effect to those acquisitions as though cobiz and the acquired entities had been combined at both dates or for both periods being compared 
the acquisition of green manning bunch ltd 
was accounted for as a purchase and the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of the acquired entity are included in the company s financial statements only for periods following the closing of that acquisition

financial condition december   compared to december  our total assets increased by million to million as of december   from million as of december  a consistent focus on internal growth and sustained loan demand allowed our loan and lease portfolio net to increase by million  from million at december   to million as of december  total investments were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in the investment portfolio was possible due to strong deposit growth  as well as advances from fhlb  and was necessary to address the interest rate sensitivity of abb s balance sheet 
deposits increased by million to million as of december   from million as of december  noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
low cost demand deposits comprised of total deposits as of december  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million at december  to million 
of this total  million represents repurchase agreements transacted on behalf of our customers and is not considered a wholesale borrowing source 
the increase in deposits and customer repurchase agreements is attributable  in part  to an increased emphasis on deposit generation included in banker production goals 
advances from the fhlb were million at december   compared to million at december   and were used to support our loan growth  as well as the investment purchases 
december   compared to december  our total assets increased by million to million as of december   from million as of december  our loan and lease portfolio net increased by million  from million at december   to million as of december  the strong loan growth was attributable to a consistent focus on internal growth and was possible due to the robust economy

net interest income the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  leases and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
for the year ended december  average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost dollars in thousands assets federal funds sold and other   investment securities     loans and leases     allowance for loan and lease losses   total interest earning assets    noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks   other    total assets    liabilities and shareholders equity deposits now and money market accounts    savings    certificates of deposit under       and over     total interest bearing deposits    other borrowings securities and loans sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased      fhlb advances     company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  total interest bearing liabilities   noninterest bearing demand accounts   total deposits and interest bearing liabilities  other noninterest bearing liabilities   total liabilities and preferred securities  shareholders equity    total liabilities and shareholders equity  net interest income   net interest spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities yields do not include adjustments for tax exempt interest because the amount of such interest is not material

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december  as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december  will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income market value of equity our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and leases and investments  early withdrawals of deposits and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
as of december   our cumulative interest rate gap for the period of less than one year was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual pricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  less than three months three months to less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets fixed rate loans      floating rate loans     lease financing     investment securities held to maturity and available for sale  total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts     savings    time deposits under     time deposits  and over    securities and loans sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased   federal home loan bank advances   company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities total interest bearing liabilities    interest rate gap      cumulative interest rate gap     cumulative interest rate gap to total assets to manage these relationships  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset and liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
our policy is intended to control the exposure of our operations to changing interest rates by attempting to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generates the net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of twelve months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans and leases by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands commercial     real estate mortgage     real estate construction     consumer    direct financing leases net    total loans and leases     as of december   of the million of loans and leases with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and leases and million were variable rate loans and leases 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  earnings performance 
net earnings available to common shareholders were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million 
reported earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for were  versus for the same period a year ago 
return on average assets was in the year  compared with in return on average common shareholders equity was for the year ended december   versus for the year ended december  the decrease in our return on average assets and equity ratios is attributed to the significant net interest margin compression experienced in total assets increased to million at december   a increase from million at december  strong loan production was responsible for much of this growth 
net loans and leases grew million from to we completed our acquisitions of first capital and milek in the first quarter of in addition  we also restructured leasing s back office operations during  transferring its support functions to the commercial banking department in order to improve profitability 
non recurring expenses in related to the mergers were  on an after tax basis 
in addition  we recorded a  after tax gain on a sale leaseback transaction of property held by first capital in the second quarter of normalized operating earnings for adjusted for these nonrecurring items and the one time gain were million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  compared to for the same period a year earlier 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with the year ended december  yields on our interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  yields paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the significant decrease in interest rate levels during has negatively affected our margin 
the net interest margin was for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  the prime rate dropped by basis points to as of december   from at december  abb s margin was especially susceptible to a falling rate environment  shrinking by approximately basis points for the year ended versus also contributing to the margin compression is the million of trust preferred securities issued in june of the securities  which have a coupon  were outstanding for only a portion of but for the entire period in the proceeds of the offering helped fund our rapid growth  which has included the abb acquisition and the addition of new product lines 
mitigating the margin contraction was an increase in average earning assets of to million for  from million for provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses increased by  to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the increase in total loans and leases outstanding and is not reflective of a deterioration of credit quality 
key indicators of asset quality have remained favorable minimal changes in nonperforming asset trends  while average outstanding loan amounts have increased to million for  up from million for as of december   the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  or of total loans and leases 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to million in revenues from our investment banking firm  gmb  acquired in july in addition  we reported an increase in deposit service charges and other banking service related fees as a result of growth in our core customer base 
included in noninterest income for was a  gain on the sale leaseback transaction related to abb s surprise location 
trust fees from our private asset management division are up year over year due to an increase in the assets under management 
however  the overall decline in the stock market has adversely impacted the division s revenues  as their fees are based on the market valuation of the accounts they manage 
insurance commissions from cobiz connect and cobiz insurance have shown steady growth as they continue to expand their client base 
there was a net decrease in operating lease rentals of  which was the result of concentrating our marketing efforts in on originating loans  rather than leases 
we focused on generating loans  as opposed to leases  because the interest spreads on loans have been more favorable than leases 
net investment in operating leases was million at december   compared to million at december  noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  included in our noninterest expense total was million of nonrecurring charges related to the abb and milek acquisitions  and leasing s restructuring 
in addition  noninterest expenses include gmb overhead from the transaction date july  however  gmb expenses are not included in our consolidated results 
during our efficiency ratio increased to from for the comparable period in the increase in the efficiency ratio is the result of the decrease in our net interest margin  as higher levels of expenses are being used to support lower yielding average assets 
overall  the increases in noninterest expenses reflect our ongoing investment in personnel  technology and office space needed to accommodate internal growth 
offsetting the increases in salaries and occupancy costs was a decrease of  in depreciation expense on operating leases 
as discussed above  management dedicated less resources to originating leases in included in our noninterest expense for the year ended and is goodwill amortization of  and  respectively 
the amortization of goodwill adversely affects our net income  although it has no effect on our cash flow 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  earnings performance 
net income was million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in net interest income from to return on average assets was in  compared with in return on average common shareholders equity was for  versus for total assets increased to million at december   a increase from million at december  strong loan production was responsible for much of this growth 
net loans and leases grew million from to net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with the year ended december  overall  we benefited from a rising rate environment in as the rates we earn on assets increased at a faster pace than the rates we pay on deposits 
interest income increased  to million in from million in in  interest on loans and leases increased by million and interest on investments increased by million 
of the million increase in  million was due to volume increases  and million was due to rate variances 
average loan and lease volumes were up by million from  and average investments were up by million 
the yield on average interest earning assets was for  compared with in on average  yields on investment securities increased to in  from in yields on average loans and leases increased to in  from in interest expense increased  to million in  from million in the increases were primarily due to higher volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
in  average interest bearing liabilities grew by million from provision for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses was million in  compared to million in this increase was due to the increase in total loans and leases outstanding  and was not reflective of a deterioration of credit quality 
in  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans declined from the previous two years 
noninterest income 
we reported a modest increase in noninterest income from to total noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to growth in trust fees  other banking service related fees  and gains on the disposition of operating lease equipment returns 
deposit service charges were relatively flat  period over period 
historically  increases in deposit service charges have not consistently corresponded with the growth in deposit balances 
this is due to our offering customers the choice of either paying for services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
in addition  there was a net decrease in operating lease rentals  which was the result of concentrating our marketing efforts in on originating loans  rather than leases 
we focused on generating loans  as opposed to leases  because the interest spreads on loans have been more favorable than leases 
net investment in operating leases was million at december   compared to million at december  during  we realized gains of  on the sale of investment securities 
there were no sales of investment securities during noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  during this period  however  the efficiency ratio before goodwill amortization improved to for the year ended december   down from for the comparable period in the improvement in the efficiency ratio is the result of revenues growing at a faster rate than expenses 
the increases in noninterest expenses reflect our ongoing investment in personnel  technology and office space needed to accommodate internal growth 
in the second quarter of  our boulder bank relocated  a second boulder location was added and the vail valley location opened 
the expenses of those new facilities were included in noninterest expense for only a portion of the year ended december   but for all of offsetting the increases in salaries and occupancy costs was a decrease of  in depreciation expense on operating leases 
as discussed above  management dedicated fewer resources to originating leases in included in our noninterest expense for the year ended and is goodwill amortization of  goodwill of million was recorded in connection with our original acquisition in is being amortized over a year period 
the amortization of this asset adversely affects our net income  although it has no effect on our cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity management objective is to ensure our ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan and lease repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan and lease prepayments  which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions and other factors  are relatively unstable 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
we use various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes on a limited basis 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  the state of colorado treasury s time deposit program and borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with seven other banks with an aggregate credit line of million 
in addition  the bank may apply for up to million of state of colorado time deposits 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
at december   we had million in unpledged securities and qualifying loans available to collateralize fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily the result of cash used in investing activities of million mainly loan and lease originations and security purchases 
offsetting the cash used in investing activities was net cash of million provided by operating activities and million in cash provided by financing activities mainly customer deposits  repurchase agreements and fhlb borrowings 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
this increase was primarily the result of cash used in investing activities of million mainly loan and lease originations and security purchases 
offsetting cash outflows from investing activities was million of cash provided by financing activities mainly customer deposits and the proceeds from the trust preferred stock 
operating activities provided net cash of million 
dividends paid by the bank provide cash to cobiz for various purposes  including the payment of dividends on its common stock and servicing the debt of the trust preferred securities 
the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
cobiz s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank  and upon cobiz s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb 
see item business supervision and regulation and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements of cobiz for an analysis of the compliance of the bank and cobiz with applicable capital adequacy guidelines 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as cobiz are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
cobiz adopted sfas on january  sfas requires business enterprises to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in their financial statements and to record such instruments at fair value 
statement no

in september of  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
it revises the standard for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral after september  and requires certain disclosures 
implementation of sfas no

in july of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements make significant changes to the accounting for business combinations  goodwill  and intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations with limited exceptions for combinations initiated prior to july  in addition  it further clarifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
this statement is effective for business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles currently included in goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas no 
also requires the company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
the company is currently assessing but has not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains the requirements relating to recognition and measurement of an impairment loss and resolves certain implementation issues resulting from sfas no 
sfas became effective january  and is not expected to have a material impact on cobiz s consolidated financial statements
