item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that reporting companies discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
the company s preparation of this annual report on form k requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements  and assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
in july  the securities and exchange commission issued an sec staff announcement which was codified as eitf topic no 
d classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
topic no 
d provides additional guidance for determining when an equity security is redeemable at the option of the holder or upon the occurrence of an event that is solely within the control of the issuer 
topic no 
d is to be applied retroactively in the first fiscal quarter ending after december  by restating the financial statements of prior periods 
during the fiscal quarter ended december   we adopted topic no 
d our series a  b and c preferred shares contain provisions for redemption in cash in the event that a change in control of the company were to occur without prior approval by our board of directors 
we have negotiated with the holders of these shares to amend those provisions by requiring the event to be subject to approval of our board of directors 
the company believes that the amended provisions will permit the company to restore the full value to stockholders equity 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under this statement  it is required that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
severance and termination benefits in connection with the restructuring plan adopted in the second quarter of  the company accrued severance and other employee related exit costs of approximately million 
this restructuring resulted in the termination of employees  including six sales and marketing  one general and administrative  and one research and development positions 
in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  the company established a liability for severance and other related costs associated with involuntary termination of employees 
the affected employees were notified of their terminations and their severance benefits before the end of the second quarter of all of the employees were terminated as of july  discontinued operations on november   the company engaged a merchant bank to explore alternatives including sale or other disposition of the company s consumer  commercial and agriculture business areas 
the company terminated operations of the consumer and commercial product business areas on february  and began the process of liquidating all assets and liabilities pertaining to those operations 
accordingly  the company has treated its consumer and commercial products operations as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb opinion no 
and has reclassified the financial statements to reflect this treatment 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a reserve in the amount of  which includes approximately  to reduce the carrying value of assets to their estimated liquidation value and a liability of approximately  to accrue for the cost of closing the operations 
the net losses of these operations prior to march  are included in the statements of operations under discontinued operations 
revenues from such operations were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
years ended december  revenues  cost of goods sold   gross margin   marketing  general and administrative  research and development  total expenses   operating loss   provision  loss on discontinued operations   the loss on discontinued operations reflected in the statement of income includes all the income statement accounts  write down of the assets to estimate net realizable values associated with the consumer products and commercial products business and the estimated costs of discontinuing these operations 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  for the twelve months ended december  versus a net loss of  for the twelve months ended december  the net loss for the twelve months ended december  included  for an adjustment for equity in loss of safescience newco  and  for dividends accrued on our series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
our total research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  are the sum of expenses reported in two lines in the consolidated statements of operations research and development r d  and equity in loss of safescience newco  ltd 
expenses related to the development of gcs incurred during the first half of fiscal were  which were charged to r d expenses 
in july  glycogenesys  inc transferred its rights to gcs in the field of oncology to safescience newco  ltd 
safescience newco 
costs related to gcs incurred after the transfer to safescience newco are on behalf of safescience newco 
amounts for expenses incurred and work performed by glycogenesys  inc on behalf of safescience newco for gcs are billed to safescience newco and netted against r d expenses 
subsequent to our investment in safescience newco our expenses associated with development of gcs flow through equity in loss of safescience newco 
for the last six months of fiscal our equity in loss of safescience newco was  of which  was recorded as a research and development expense for our share of the cost of the license granted to safescience newco by elan international services  ltd   in research and development charges incurred by the company billed to the joint venture   of our allowable overhead charges and the balance representing our portion of other safescience newco expenses  respectively 
total research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were thus  the sum of the  recorded in r d and  our portion of the equity in loss of safescience newco  ltd 
attributable to our research and development expenses in connection with the development of gcs in the field of oncology 
total research and development expenses thus increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  we incurred research and development expenses of  related to license fees paid to wayne state university and non cash research and development expenses of  in connection with warrants issued to wayne state university to purchase common stock which vested during the year 
cost of managing our clinical trials decreased from  to  or  during the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to completion of the field work on both the colorectal and pancreatic trials 
sponsored research increased from  to  or  during the year ended december  compared to primarily due to our new relationship with mit 
research and development expenses for elexa and bb  our agricultural compounds  decreased from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of wages  consulting and license fees 
the decrease reflects the company s de emphasis of its agricultural business 
we have engaged an investment advisor to assist in the sale or other disposition of this registered product 
we expect future expenditures to be limited to a level similar to last year 
the company is actively seeking to expand its product pipeline under development 
these new product candidates will either be developed jointly or licensed by the company 
the cost related to the development of new product candidates is projected to be in the range of  during the twelve months ended december  although it could be higher 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to reductions in outside consulting of  public relations of  office expenses in the aggregate of approximately  expenses of  charged to safescience newco flowing through our equity in loss of safescience newco  travel expense of  rent expense related to the reclassification in of approximately  to discontinued operations for space which is deemed to be surplus offset by expenses previously charged as overhead to operations now discontinued of  an increase in legal expense of  or  from  to  due primarily to professional fees associated with the negotiation of the elan transactions and non cash compensation for stock options granted to employees of  interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment and lower rates of return on those investments 
on november   the board of directors authorized the sale or other disposition of the company s consumer and commercial products business 
the company discontinued operations on february  and began the process of liquidating all assets pertaining to those operations 
the net losses of these operations prior to march  are included in the statements of operations under discontinued operations 
revenues from such operations were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
years ended december  revenues  cost of goods sold   gross margin   marketing  general and administrative  research and development  total expenses   operating loss   provision  loss on discontinued operations   the loss on discontinued operations reflected in the statement of income includes all the income statement accounts  write down of the assets to estimate net realizable values associated with the consumer products and commercial products business and the estimated costs of discontinuing these operations 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december on november   the board of directors authorized the sale or other disposition of the company s consumer and commercial products business 
the company discontinued operations on february  and began the process of liquidating all assets pertaining to those operations

research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase was principally attributable to the company s ongoing clinical trials of gcs  its lead pharmaceutical compound and increased salaries and consulting expense on agriculture product development 
included in research and development costs in are  of non cash compensation resulting from the issuance of stock grants  and stock options and warrants to purchase common stock 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to a reduction in consulting expense and officers compensation partially offset by increases in other salaries and rent 
non cash compensation to various consultants and advisors of  in and  in resulted from the issuance of stock grants  stock options and warrants to purchase common stock 
during the second quarter of  the company began a restructuring of operations including the replacement of its chief executive officer 
in connection with this severance and other employee reductions  the company recorded a charge in the amount of  to cover the estimated costs of terminating an existing employment agreement and other severance costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily with the proceeds from equity securities totaling approximately  for the year ended december   the company s operations utilized cash of approximately  primarily to fund the operating loss 
this use of cash was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  to the company 
in  the company s operations utilized cash of approximately  which was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were as follows computer and office equipment  the company has no significant commitments for the purchase of equipment  product manufacturing facilities or marketing efforts at present 
the company leases office facilities under an operating lease that ends in march rent expense for this space will be approximately  in the company anticipates that will be adequate for its space requirements for the foreseeable future 
during the first quarter of  the company retained beardsworth consulting group  a full service contract research organization  to support two projects a phase i dose escalation trial  and database transfer management for the recently completed phase iia trials 
they will provide clinical research management  study monitoring  data management and medical writing 
the costs for both efforts will be approximately  and be paid out over the next months 
in addition  costs associated with the phase i dose escalation trial currently being conducted at sharp clinical oncology research memorial hospital will be approximately  paid over the next months 
as of december   the company s cash balances were  as compared to  as of december  the company has a  stand by secured line of credit with a bank which has no outstanding balance and a secured letter of credit in the amount of  which is held as security for deposits required by its lease of office space 
the company has no other commercial financing sources at present but may seek such sources in the future 
it is not known whether additional funds could be borrowed from stockholders or other sources 
as of april   the company s cash and cash equivalents was approximately  the company believes that its existing funds will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements into the first quarter of the company intends to raise additional debt and or equity financing 
we may receive approximately million of additional funds from elan international services  ltd 
eis for the development of gcs pursuant to our agreement with eis 
however  we will not receive additional capital from eis unless we agree with eis on a quarterly basis on the business plan for safescience newco  ltd 
the company s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing to fund its operations 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure and market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other which could positively or negatively affect results of operations and retained earnings 
as of december   the company has evaluated its risk and determined that any exposure to currency exchange is not significant to the company s overall consolidated financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company s exposure will remain at these levels  especially in the event of significant and sudden fluctuations in the value of local currencies 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the company maintains short term investments in an overnight money market account comprised of us treasury bills 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels that existed at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
certain factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have experienced significant losses throughout our history  we expect these losses to continue and we may not achieve profitability in the future 
we began operations more than eight years ago and began to generate revenue only in the second quarter of through december  we only generated  from product sales 
on february   we announced the discontinuation of our consumer and commercial product business from which all of our revenues to date have been generated 
we do not expect to generate product revenue for several years  if at all 
we will not generate funds on an ongoing basis unless we receive current payments with respect to the sale of these areas  or generate revenues through the receipt of payments in connection with any potential licensing  marketing or other partnering arrangement with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or bringing to market pharmaceutical or agricultural products 
we have incurred an estimated million of losses since our inception  including million for the year ended december  extensive losses can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
our products are still in development  there are uncertainties associated with research and development activities and we may be unable to bring these products to market 
our proposed products require further research  development  laboratory testing  regulatory approval and or demonstration of commercial scale manufacturing before they can be proven to be commercially viable 
the products are in the development stage and are subject to the risks inherent in the development of new products 
potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that potential products are found during testing to be ineffective  or unsafe  that they fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  are difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a large scale  fail to achieve market acceptance or are precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty when  or if  the research  development  testing and or regulatory approval process for our proposed products will be completed 
our product development efforts may be unsuccessful  required regulatory approvals from us or foreign authorities may not be obtained  and products  if introduced  may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully marketed 
the failure of our research and development activities to result in any commercially viable products or technologies would materially adversely affect our future prospects 
we may not be able to obtain additional funding  which could reduce our ability to fund  expand or continue operations 
the company believes that its existing funds will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements into the first quarter of the company intends to raise additional debt and or equity financing 
we may receive approximately million of additional funds from elan international services  ltd 
eis for the development of gcs pursuant to our agreement with eis 
however  we will not receive additional capital from eis unless we agree with eis on a quarterly basis on the business plan for safescience newco  ltd 
the company s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing to fund its operations 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we may also seek funds in conjunction with the in licensing of additional biopharmaceutical products where we acquire in licenses and development funds for our securities 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to our shareholders 
if the market price of our common stock declines  some potential investors may either refuse to offer us any financing or will offer additional financing at unacceptable rates or unfavorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain financing necessary to fund our operations  we may have to sell or liquidate glycogenesys 
our failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement on the property rights of others may impede our ability to operate freely 
we rely significantly upon proprietary technology and protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights  trademarks and contractual agreements as appropriate 
the company owns  or is the exclusive licensee of  all of its intellectual property 
this intellectual property includes eight issued us patents which have expiration dates ranging from to  three of these eight patents relate directly to gcs the intellectual property also includes three foreign patents having expiration dates ranging from to two of these three foreign patents relate directly to gcs the company s intellectual property further includes eight pending us patent applications  of which six directly relate to gcs  and pending foreign patent applications of which relate directly to gcs we continually evaluate our technology to determine whether to make further patent filings 
to the extent certain aspects of our technology may be unpatentable or we determine to maintain such technology as trade secrets  we protect such unpatented technology by contractual agreements 
our unpatented technology or similar technology could be independently developed by others 
in addition  the contractual agreements by which we protect our unpatented technology and trade secrets may be breached 
if our technology is independently developed or our contractual agreements are breached  our technology will be less valuable and our business will be harmed 
there is always a risk that issued patents may be subsequently invalidated  either in whole or in part  and this could diminish or extinguish our patent protection for key elements of our technology 
we are not involved in any such litigation or proceedings  nor are we aware of any basis for such litigation or proceedings 
we cannot be certain as to the scope of patent protection  if any  which may be granted on our patent applications 
our potential products or business activities could be determined to infringe intellectual rights of third parties despite our issued patents 
any claims against us or any purchaser or user of our potential products  including gcs  asserting that such product or process infringes intellectual property rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us could have a material effect on our business  financial condition or future operations 
any asserted claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event a claim is successful against us and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties and if we are unable to continue licensing this technology our future prospects may be materially adversely affected 
we license our technology  including gcs  from third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
to maintain our license with wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute we must  among other things  pay wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute approximately  in four monthly payments through july plus an additional  on may   pay royalties on product sales and up to million in milestone payments and receive fda or equivalent agency approval to sell gcs by january  to maintain our license with dr 
platt we must pay an annual license fee equal to the greater of  or of product sales starting this year 
to maintain our joint venture s license with elan for its oral drug delivery technology we do not have material obligations other than royalty payments  if any  which shall be determined by safescience newco prior to commercialization of gcs the technology we license from third parties would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses would result in delays in the availability of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated and could materially adversely affect our future prospects 
the use of replacement technology from other third parties would require us to enter into license agreements with these third parties  which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation 
we expect to remain dependent on third parties for research and development activities necessary to commercialize our products 
we do not maintain our own laboratories and employ five scientific personnel 
we contract out research and development operations  utilizing third party contract manufacturers to supply clinical grade material and third party contract research organizations  to perform pre clinical and or clinical studies in accordance with our designed protocols  as well as sponsoring research at several medical and academic centers  such as mit and wayne state university 
in addition  we employ several consultants to oversee various aspects of our protocol design  clinical trial oversight and other research and development functions 
because we rely on third parties for much of our research and development work  we have less direct control over our research and development 
we face risks that these third parties may not be appropriately responsive to our timeframes and development needs 
our future prospects are heavily dependent on the results of gcs while we have more than one product in development  we do not have a wide array of products which we are developing 
most of our attention and resources are directed to the development of gcs if gcs is ultimately ineffective in treating cancer  does not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or does not obtain commercial acceptance  glycogenesys will be materially adversely affected 
the development of gcs is not in our exclusive control and is jointly determined with elan and eis 
we are developing gcs through collaboration with elan and eis 
safescience newco  ltd 
is a company that we formed and jointly own with eis to develop gcs in the field of oncology 
we own and eis owns of safescience newco  ltd 
despite our majority ownership of safescience newco  ltd  we do not fully control the development activities regarding gcs  because we need consent of eis for material development decisions regarding gcs as a result  development of gcs will depend on our ability to negotiate development issues with eis 
eis has the right to exchange our series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock it owns for all of the convertible preferred securities we own of safescience newco  ltd 
at any time until july   which would give eis a ownership interest in safescience newco  ltd 
if eis exercises this right  our ownership in safescience newco  ltd 
will be reduced to from its current  which would reduce our economic interest in gcs if our agriculture products are not accepted by the agricultural community our business will suffer 
our focus is primarily pharmaceuticals and to a lesser extent agricultural products 
although we currently do not market any products  commercial sales of our proposed agricultural products will substantially depend upon the products efficacy and on their acceptance by the agricultural community 
for example  elexa works by a different mode of action than current fungicides because it increases a plant s natural resistance to disease instead of killing the fungus directly 
widespread acceptance of elexa in the agricultural field will require educating the agricultural community as to the benefits and reliability of elexa 
our proposed products may not be accepted  and  even if accepted  we are unable to estimate the length of time it would take to gain such acceptance 
if the third parties we rely on for manufacturing our products are unable to produce the necessary amounts of our products  do not meet our quality needs or terminate their relationships with us  our business will suffer 
we do not presently have our own manufacturing operations  nor do we intend to establish any unless and until in the opinion of our management  the size and scope of our business so warrants 
while we have established manufacturing relationships with two contract manufacturing firms involved in the production of gcs and one contract manufacturing firm involved in the production of elexa that we believe will provide the capability to meet our anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future  we have not entered into any long term arrangements for manufacturing and such arrangements may not be obtained on desirable terms 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we will be dependent upon third parties to manufacture our products 
our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in  access to necessary manufacturing processes and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers 
the use of a new manufacturer may cause significant interruptions in supply if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications 
further  the introduction of a new manufacturer may increase the variation in the quality of our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products that make our potential products and technologies obsolete or non competitive 
a biotechnology company such as ours must keep pace with rapid technological change and faces intense competition 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for funding  access to new technology  research personnel and in product research and development 
many of these companies have greater financial resources and more experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
we also face competition from academic and research institutions and government agencies pursuing alternatives to our products and technologies 
we expect that our products under development  including gcs  will face intense competition from existing or future drugs 
in addition  our product candidates may face increasing competition from generic formulations or existing drugs whose active components are no longer covered by patents 
according to industry surveys there are approximately new drug candidates in development to treat various types of cancer 
this research is being conducted by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the national cancer institute nci 
we have conducted two phase i clinical trials  the first enrolled late stage patients with differing types of cancer and the second enrolled patients with late stage prostate cancer 
we also conducted and completed two phase iia clinical trials  one in patients with refractory or relapsing pancreatic cancer and the other in refractory or relapsing colorectal cancer 
published surveys indicate that  including gcs  approximately twenty six drugs are in various stages of clinical trial development for pancreatic cancer and fifty five drugs in various stages of clinical trial development for colorectal cancer 
our current clinical trial plan is to pursue pancreatic cancer as a lead indication and we are planning to conduct a phase ii iii pivotal trial in there are approximately ten drugs currently having completed or in phase iii clinical trial development  ten drugs in phase ii and six drugs in phase i for pancreatic cancer 
competitors may receive approval before us for competing pancreatic cancer drugs  including without limitation the following drugs which have completed phase iii trials imclone and bristol meyer s erbitux  pharmacia s camptosar  snaofi synthelabo s tirapazamine  aphton and aventis pasteur s anti gastrin therapeutic vaccine  genentech s herceptin already approved for breast cancer  mgi pharma s irofulven  supergens mitoextra and rubiteacan  janssen pharmaceuticals r and lorus therapeutics virulizin 
in addition  gcs  if it receives fda approval  will face competition from existing cancer drugs approved for pancreatic cancer 
these drugs are flourouacil fu and eli lilly s gemcitabine gemzar 
combination studies utilizing new drug candidates and gemzar are ongoing and combination therapies of new drug candidates and gemzar may present future competition 
our competitors may 
successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do  
obtain approvals from the fda or foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we do  
develop products that are more effective  have fewer side effects or cost less than our products  or 
successfully market products that may compete with our products candidates 
the success of our competitors in any of these efforts would adversely affect our ability to develop  commercialize and market our product candidates 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation and failure to achieve regulatory approval of our products would severely harm our business 
the fda regulates the manufacture  distribution and promotion of pharmaceutical products in the united states pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and related regulations 
we must receive premarket approval by the fda for any commercial sale of our pharmaceutical products 
before receiving such approval we must provide proof in human clinical trials of the nontoxicity  safety and efficacy of our pharmaceutical products  which trials can take several years 
premarket approval is a lengthy and expensive process 
we may not be able to obtain fda approval for any commercial sale of our product 
by regulation  the fda has days to review an application for approval to market a pharmaceutical product  however  the fda frequently exceeds the day time period 
in addition  based on its review  the fda may determine that additional clinical trials are required 
except for any potential licensing or marketing arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  we will not generate any revenues in connection with our pharmaceutical products unless and until we obtain fda approval to sell our products in commercial quantities for human application 
the investigation  manufacture and sale of agricultural products are subject to regulation by the epa  including the need for approval before marketing  and by comparable foreign and state agencies 
our agricultural products will be able to be commercially marketed for use either in the united states or other countries only by first obtaining the necessary approvals 
while we hope to obtain regulatory approvals for our proposed products  we may not obtain these approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
we have received approval from the epa  california and other states for elexa 
reimbursement procedures and future healthcare reform measures are uncertain and may adversely impact our ability to successfully sell any pharmaceutical product 
our ability to successfully sell any pharmaceutical product will depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse patients for the costs of our future pharmaceutical products and related treatments 
in the united states  government and other third party payers have sought to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these payers may refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products to treat medical conditions even though the fda has granted marketing approval 
healthcare reform may increase these cost containment efforts 
we believe that managed care organizations may seek to restrict the use of new products  delay authorization to use new products or limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products 
internationally  where national healthcare systems are prevalent  little if any funding may be available for new products  and cost containment and cost reduction efforts can be more pronounced than in the united states 
certain of our prior securities offerings may not have complied with state securities laws which could result in penalties being imposed upon us 
certain prior private placement offerings of our securities may not have complied with technical requirements of applicable state securities laws 
in such situations a number of remedies may potentially be available to regulatory authorities and stockholders who purchased securities in such offerings 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary 
our success will depend on our ability to retain key employees and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
we may hire additional clinical operations personnel in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain existing personnel or attract qualified employees in the future 
our limited drug pipeline and small size make it more difficult to compete for such personnel against larger  more diversified companies 
at present  we employ approximately full time employees and one part time worker 
we depend upon the personal efforts and abilities of our officers and directors  including bradley j 
carver  our president  ceo and a director  john w 
burns  our senior vice president and chief financial officer and brian gr hughes  chairman of the board and would be materially adversely affected if their services ceased to be available for any reason and comparable replacement personnel were not employed 
the businesses in which we engage have a risk of product liability  and in the event of a successful suit against us  our business could be severely harmed 
the testing  marketing and sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims by consumers and others 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance which we believe to be adequate and consistent with industry norms for similar stage biotechnology companies  such insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or may not be sufficient to fully cover any potential claims 
in the event of a successful suit against us  the lack or insufficiency of insurance coverage and damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are contractually obligated to issue shares in the future  including shares to be issued upon the conversion of outstanding preferred stock and warrants held by eis and others  which will cause dilution of your interest in us 
as of december   there are outstanding options to purchase  shares of common stock  at a weighted average exercise price of per share and outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
moreover  we may in the future issue additional shares to raise capital  acquire other companies or technologies  to pay for services  or for other corporate purposes 
any such issuances will have the effect of further diluting the interest of the purchasers of the current shareholders 
in july  in connection with a business venture and financing transaction  we sold to eis  shares of our series c convertible non voting preferred stock   shares of our series a convertible exchangeable non voting preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in december  we sold shares of our series b convertible non voting preferred stock to eis 
each share of our series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock is presently convertible after july  into  shares of our common stock 
each share of our series b preferred stock is presently convertible after december  into  shares of our common stock 
the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock each bear a dividend payable in series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock  respectively  which compounds annually 
in january we sold to eis warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock in connection with a private placement 
accordingly  a total of  shares of our common stock could be issued to eis  assuming the exercise of the warrants and the conversion into common stock of all shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock currently outstanding  but not including any dividends to be issued on the series a and series b preferred stock 
this amount of shares represents of our currently outstanding common stock 
pursuant to provisions in our agreement with eis  if the exercise or conversion of any of our securities held by eis would result in eis owning more than of our common stock at any time eis may opt to receive non voting securities instead of common stock 
in addition  we may elect to sell to eis  subject to its agreement  up to an additional  shares of our series b convertible non voting preferred stock in the future at a price per share of  upon conversion  a total of an additional  shares of common stock would be issued to eis assuming the purchase of all the remaining series b preferred stock  but not including any dividends to be issued on the series b preferred stock 
thus  we could potentially issue a total of  shares of our common stock to eis  assuming the exercise of all warrants and conversion of all series a  series b and series c preferred stock outstanding or that may be sold to eis in the future  but excluding any dividends to be issued on the series a and series b preferred stock 
this amount of shares represents of our currently outstanding common stock 
we must comply with the listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market or our common stock may decline and the liquidity of an investment in our securities would decrease 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq stock market for the following reasons 
if the bid price of our common stock falls below per share for thirty consecutive business days  or 
if our market capitalization falls below million and we have less than a  in net tangible assets totalassets less total liabilities and goodwill or b  in equity  or 
if the value of our common stock held by our stockholders other than our directors  executive officers and stockholders is less than  on november   the  net tangible assets test will no longer be a listing requirement and will be replaced by the requirement to have no less than  in equity 
there are other quantitative and qualitative criteria of the nasdaq smallcap market which if violated could lead to delisting of our common stock 
on june   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market notifying us that the staff had determined that we did not comply with the minimum standards for continued listing 
on july   we filed a current report on form k a containing our unaudited may  balance sheet on a pro forma basis reflecting the closing of the transaction with elan and eis 
on july   we were notified by nasdaq that they deemed us to be in compliance with the net tangible assets market capitalization net income requirement and all other requirements necessary for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
however  we may not be able to maintain our compliance with nasdaq continued listing requirements in the future 
the closing bid price of our common stock has not been below for a thirty day period 
however  the closing bid price has been below for days ending on april  and as recently as october for a five day period ending on october  our market capitalization is above million as of april  but has been below million as recently as december our net tangible assets and equity as reported in the unaudited financial statements are less than  and  respectively  as of december  if nasdaq delisted our common stock  we would likely seek to list our common stock for quotation on a regional stock exchange 
however  if we were unable to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange  trading of our common stock would occur in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board for unlisted securities or in what are commonly known as the pink sheets 
in addition  delisting from nasdaq and failure to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange would subject our common stock to so called penny stock rules 
these rules impose additional sales practice and market making requirements on broker dealers who sell and or make a market in such securities  such as disclosing offer and bid prices and compensation received from a trade to a purchaser and sending monthly account statements to purchasers 
consequently  broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell and or make a market in our common stock 
additionally  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
as a result of delisting  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our securities 
our stock price could decline if a significant number of shares become available for sale 
approximately  shares of common stock presently issued and outstanding are restricted securities as that term is defined in rule promulgated under the act 
in general  a person or persons whose shares are aggregated who has satisfied a one year holding period may sell  within any three month period  an amount of restricted securities which does not exceed the greater of of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale 
restricted securities can be sold  under certain circumstances  without any quantity limitation  by persons who are not affiliates of glycogenesys and who have beneficially owned the shares for a minimum period of two years 
the company has filed a registration statement on form s  which is not yet effective  with respect to  shares of the approximately  restricted securities  as well as with respect to shares issued upon the exercise of warrants 
in addition  the company has seven s registration statements which are currently effective 
the sale of these restricted shares and the registered shares shall increase the number of free trading shares and may have a depressive effect on the price of our securities 
moreover  such sales  if substantial  might also adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital 
because our current management controls a significant percentage of our common stock  they have substantial control over us 
the holders of the common stock do not have cumulative voting rights 
our directors  one of whom is an executive officer of glycogenesys  own approximately collectively of the outstanding shares of common stock 
these stockholders can substantially influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
one of the conditions of the transactions between us  elan and eis requires that we expand our board of directors to six members on the next regularly scheduled stockholders meeting at which time eis may appoint one director 
eis has currently decided not to appoint a director at the next regularly scheduled stockholders meeting  but may choose to do so in the future 
if eis appoints a director  members of the board of directors and their affiliates shall own approximately of the outstanding common stock  assuming eis has not converted or exercised any of our securities held by it  and the same number of shares are outstanding at such time as are currently outstanding 
if eis were to have converted or exercised all of our securities held by it  the members of our board of directors and their affiliates would own approximately of the outstanding common stock  assuming the number of shares outstanding at such time equals the number of shares currently outstanding plus the number of shares issued on exercise or conversion of securities held by eis 
this percentage would increase if we were to sell additional shares of our series b preferred stock to eis 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could materially adversely affect our stock price 
the price of our common stock has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses by you 
the market price of our common stock  which is traded on the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq small cap has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during the twelve months ending march   our common stock has traded at prices ranging from to per share 
factors such as announcements of clinical trial results  financings  technological innovations or new products  either by us or by our competitors or third parties  as well as market conditions within the biotech and pharmaceutical industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the biotechnology sector  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
current market conditions are particularly unstable and there is a large degree of uncertainty at this time 
in general  biotechnology stocks tend to be volatile even during periods of relative market stability because of the high rates of failure and substantial funding requirements associated with biotechnology companies 
market conditions and conditions of the biotechnology sector could negatively impact the price of our common stock
