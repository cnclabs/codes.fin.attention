item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows provides analysis and information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report on form k  and the section entitled risk factors included in part i  item of this report on form k 
overview comarco  inc  through its subsidiary comarco wireless technologies  inc 
collectively  we  comarco  or the company  is a leading provider of hardware and software products and services for the wireless industry 
comarco also designs and manufactures remote voice systems and mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  and handheld devices 
during october  we embarked on a plan to divest our non wireless businesses  which included the defense and commercial staffing businesses 
the divestiture plan was completed during november accordingly  our continuing operations consist solely of the operations of comarco wireless technologies  inc cwt 
results of operations continuing operations we have two reportable operating segments wireless infrastructure and wireless applications 
wireless infrastructure our wireless infrastructure business designs and manufactures hardware and software tools for use by wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and others 
rf engineers  professional technicians  and others use these tools to design  deploy  and optimize wireless networks  and to verify the performance of the wireless networks once deployed 
the wireless infrastructure business is also a provider of engineering services that assist wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and others deploy  optimize  and evaluate the performance of wireless networks 
when engaged  we are able to provide and support skilled rf engineers and professional technicians and the tools best suited for the engagement 
as wireless carriers deploy g technologies across their existing networks and ultimately evolve to g systems  the demand for next generation wireless infrastructure products and services is expected to increase 
wireless applications our wireless applications business designs and manufactures remote voice systems and mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  and handheld devices 
remote voice systems currently include various call box products that provide emergency communication over existing wireless networks 
in addition to the call box products  we provide system installation and long term maintenance services 
currently  approximately  cwt call boxes are installed  the majority of which are serviced and maintained under long term agreements 
the wireless applications segment also includes the chargesource family of mobile power products 
the watt universal ac power adapter  our second generation mobile power system  powers and charges most laptop computers  cellular telephones  handheld devices  and portable printers 
the chargesource product offering has been 
table of contents expanded with the newly designed chargesource universal dc power adapter 
the universal dc power adapter allows traveling professionals to use all of their existing chargesource smarttips on the road or in the air 
the new device connects to the in seat power outlet available on most major airlines or the cigarette lighter plug found in cars today 
the new chargesource universal dc power adapter began shipping during the third quarter of fiscal targus currently distributes these two products 
we anticipate expanding the chargesource product offering with a watt universal power adapter with both ac and dc inputs during the third quarter of fiscal this product is targeted at the users of cellular telephones  pocket pcs  handheld devices  and digital cameras and camcorders

the product revenue growth was due to increased sales from our wireless infrastructure segment  partially offset by a decrease in sales from our wireless applications segment 
the services revenue growth was due to increased sales of engineering services from our wireless infrastructure segment 
cost of revenue and gross margin total cost of revenue for fiscal increased percent to million compared with fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased slightly to percent from percent for fiscal while the gross margin for fiscal was comparable to the prior year  it was a result of increased sales volumes and margins of our wireless applications products offset by deceased sales volumes and margins of our wireless infrastructure products and services 
total cost of revenue for fiscal increased percent to million compared with fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to percent from percent for fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes in our higher margin wireless infrastructure segment  including increased sales of hardware and software tools and engineering services  partially offset by decreased sales volumes and margins in our wireless applications products 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal increased percent to million compared to fiscal excluding costs attributable to edx engineering  inc edx  which was acquired on december   selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal decreased million in comparison to the prior year 
this decrease was driven by lower sales in our wireless infrastructure segment during fiscal  as well as enterprise wide cost reductions that were put in place during fiscal these cost reductions  including eliminating direct sales and marketing efforts for our chargesource mobile power products  closing the sales and support office in london  and reorganizing our remote voice systems business  resulted in a significant reduction of indirect costs 
selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal increased percent to million compared to fiscal this increase for fiscal was due to staffing increases in support of the engineering services offering that commenced full operations during the first quarter of fiscal  costs related to the marketing of the chargesource watt universal ac power adapter  and increased commissions on wireless infrastructure product sales 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative costs were percent  percent  and percent for fiscal   and  respectively

engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  for fiscal increased percent to million compared to fiscal both year over year increases were partially offset by increased capitalized software development costs totaling million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases in gross engineering and capitalized software development costs are primarily due to continued investment in our hardware and software product development programs  which include gprs and xrtt products g technologies  as well as g scanners and related applications 
severance costs during the second quarter of fiscal and in conjunction with the disposition of our non wireless businesses  we were required to record a million charge to continuing operations for costs related to severance agreements for outgoing corporate staff 
this charge did not recur in fiscal

as previously discussed  many of our customers  primarily wireless carriers  have been negatively impacted by a wireless industry experiencing slowing subscriber growth  intensifying price competition  reduced access to capital  and the need to manage cash flow 
coupled with a weakened economy  wireless carriers have responded to these challenges by reducing capital spending and focusing on projects that can most directly contribute to their revenue 
wireless carriers now appear focused on satisfying customer demand for enhanced data services  seamless and comprehensive coverage  improved qos  and faster data transmission 
many of these initiatives require capital spending for additional network capacity and next generation technologies 
with reduced availability of capital and the transition to next generation technologies  plans  projects  and capital spending are subject to frequent change as wireless carriers reevaluate and reorder their priorities 
as a result  their spending patterns are increasingly volatile and difficult to predict 
the recent downturn in the wireless industry has reduced overall demand for our wireless infrastructure products and services  and has made it difficult for us to forecast our wireless infrastructure operations for fiscal additionally  the downturn in the wireless industry has caused us to reevaluate our strategy of providing engineering services 
we began offering engineering services  which are complementary to our wireless infrastructure products  to wireless carriers and equipment vendors during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the subsequent two years  we were awarded several profitable multi million dollar contracts  as well as numerous smaller engagements 
however  during the past year and as wireless carriers reduced their spending  the competition to provide engineering services has become more intense 
lower contract pricing and fewer opportunities are resulting in reduced revenue and profitability for all engineering services providers 
we currently do not have a major contract to provide engineering services  and accordingly  have reduced staffing and related expenses to a level consistent with the future profit opportunity associated with providing these services 
we currently expect fiscal revenue and gross profit attributable to engineering services to be significantly less than the prior year 
for fiscal   and  engineering services provided million  million  and million  respectively  of revenue  and million  million  and million  respectively  of gross profit 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to provide engineering services and intend to execute only those contracts that we project to be profitable 
for fiscal   and  customers of our wireless infrastructure business accounted for percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our annual revenue  and percent  percent  and 
table of contents percent  respectively  of our annual gross profit 
due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wireless infrastructure products and services  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue and or operating income  negatively affecting our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we are currently unable to predict when the downturn in the wireless industry will cease to have a negative impact on our revenues and operating results 
revenue from our wireless infrastructure segment for fiscal was million  an increase of million or percent compared to fiscal this increase was due to strong growth in sales of our hardware and software tools and increased sales of engineering services that were initially offered during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  during fiscal  a national wireless carrier purchased a significant number of baseline systems  our qos competitive benchmarking system 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue from our wireless infrastructure segment for fiscal was million  a decrease of million or percent compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to percent from percent for fiscal the decease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreased sales volumes of hardware and software tools 
the decrease in gross margin is attributable to decreased absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses and increased labor costs  when viewed as a percentage of revenue  driven by lower sales of our hardware and software tools 
cost of revenue from our wireless infrastructure business for fiscal was million  an increase of million or percent compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to percent from percent for fiscal the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes of both hardware and software tools and engineering services 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased revenue attributable to our lower margin engineering services 
the markets for our wireless infrastructure products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and product obsolescence  evolving industry standards  and possible price erosion over the life of a product 
due to these competitive pressures  we expect the average sales prices of our existing products to decrease during fiscal it is possible that we will release new products at lower sales prices  which will also impact the average sales prices of our products 
future pricing actions by us and by our competitors may also adversely impact our gross margins and operating income  which could also result in decreased liquidity and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
while we continue to strive for manufacturing and engineering cost reductions to offset fluctuations in demand and possible pricing pressure on our products  we cannot guarantee that these cost reduction or redesign efforts will keep pace with declining demand and pricing  and cost increases 
our existing portfolio of products  as well as our newly developed next generation products  may not be able to maintain or achieve  in the case of new products  gross margin levels achieved in prior years 
if we are unable to reduce our costs through our manufacturing and engineering efforts  our gross margins and operating income may continue to be adversely affected 
wireless applications years ended january  in thousands revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin 
table of contents revenue revenue from our wireless applications segment for fiscal was million  an increase of million or percent compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to increased sales of the chargesource watt universal ac power adapter  our second generation mobile power system that began shipping during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the introduction of the new chargesource universal dc power adapter that began shipping during the third quarter of fiscal both chargesource products are currently distributed exclusively by targus under annual non cancelable commitments specifying minimum annual quantities to be purchased 
in the event targus is unable to perform under these commitments due to their inability to take delivery of the minimum quantities and or pay for such minimum quantities in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
the financial impact of a material change in our relationship with targus cannot be precisely quantified  but we believe that a six to twelve month disruption in the distribution of our chargesource products would have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results  which could also result in decreased liquidity 
for fiscal   and  sales to targus totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we have recently received a non cancelable commitment from targus  valued at million  and have begun delivering on this commitment during fiscal revenue from our wireless applications segment for fiscal was million  a decrease of million or percent compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of upgrades to previously installed call box systems 
call box systems are upgraded periodically based on the age of the technology  condition of the installed call box system  and the needs of the respective customers 
system upgrades do not recur annually 
the decrease in fiscal was partially offset by a million increase in sales of the chargesource watt universal ac power adapter that went into production during the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue from our wireless applications segment for fiscal was million  an increase of million or percent compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to percent from percent for fiscal the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes of our chargesource mobile power products 
cost of revenue from our wireless applications segment for fiscal was million  a decrease of million or percent compared to fiscal the decrease in cost of revenue was consistent with the decreased sales volumes of call box systems and upgrades 
the decrease in gross margin was due to increased costs associated with providing maintenance services for installed call box systems and costs incurred transitioning to the chargesource watt universal ac power adapter from the watt  a first generation product 
discontinued operations as discussed above  we embarked on a plan to divest our non wireless businesses  which included the defense and commercial staffing businesses 
the divestiture plan was completed during november net loss from discontinued operations was  for fiscal  which includes net income during phase out of  on revenue of million  less an after tax loss of  on the disposition of our non wireless businesses 
liquidity and capital resources our financial position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents of million at january  cash flows from operating activities we generated cash from operations of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in cash generation from fiscal to fiscal is primarily 
table of contents due to a significant decrease in current liabilities and amounts accrued in conjunction with the disposition of our non wireless businesses during fiscal also contributing to the decrease in cash generation was a million increase in inventory 
this increase is related to the introduction of our newly developed chargesource universal dc power adapter that went into production during the third quarter of fiscal additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also increased our inventory of certain components in anticipation of fourth quarter sales of our wireless infrastructure products 
however  fourth quarter sales were lower than anticipated and historical levels 
we expect these components to be consumed in the next several quarters 
the increase in cash generation from fiscal to fiscal is due to an increase in net income from continuing operations and depreciation and amortization  amounts accrued in conjunction with the disposition of our non wireless businesses during fiscal  and an increase in the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal in all periods  capital expenditures for property and equipment  acquisitions  and software development partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities 
the development of software is critical to our products currently under development 
we intend to invest aggressively in a software development program designed to bring new products for the wireless industry to market in a timely manner 
on july   the company acquired an percent equity stake in swissqual for million in cash 
based in zuchwil  switzerland  swissqual is a developer of voice quality systems and software for measuring  monitoring  and optimizing the quality of mobile  fixed  and ip based voice and data communications 
under this alliance  comarco and swissqual will jointly develop  sell  and support wireless network qos and optimization products and services for the european marketplace 
in addition to expanding our access to european wireless carriers  swissqual will provide domain expertise and development guidance in the evolution of g and g system test solutions 
on december   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of edx for  shares of our common stock  valued at million on the day the transaction closed  and million in cash 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal and net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal in all periods  proceeds from the sales of common stock issued through employee and director stock option plans  offset by the repurchase of our common stock  constituted substantially all of our cash provided by and used in financing activities 
during  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
from program inception through january   we repurchased approximately million shares for an average price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares in the open market for an average price of per share 
we maintained a million unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility expired in june and was not renewed 
we intend to put in place an unsecured credit facility when deemed necessary 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including 
table of contents due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wireless infrastructure products and services  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue and operating results  we currently do not have a major contract to provide engineering services  and accordingly  have reduced staffing and related expenses to a level consistent with the future profit opportunity associated with providing these services  and in the event targus  the exclusive distributor of our chargesource products  is unable to perform under the non cancelable commitments due to their inability to take delivery of the minimum quantities and or pay for such minimum quantities in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
we currently expect fiscal revenue and operating results attributable to our wireless infrastructure business to be significantly less than fiscal  and  as a result we expect fiscal cash flows from operations to also decrease in comparison to fiscal to address this  we are focused on preserving our cash balances by continuously monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products most likely to contribute to our profitability 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  valuation of goodwill  and valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time products are shipped or services performed 
our products typically carry a one year warranty 
we provide reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials  and service delivery costs incurred correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates and the cost to correct differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize the development cost of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new product  but expense the costs associated with new releases  which consist of enhancements or increased functionality of existing products 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software development costs including software acquired through acquisition or by direct purchase of technology 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have 
table of contents historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts  historical bad debt  trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
as demonstrated during fiscal  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our forecasts of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory was determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
income taxes we assess our deferred tax assets to determine the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill  and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and projecting cash flows 
in our fiscal year ending january   sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill acquired prior to july  we recorded million of amortization on these amounts during fiscal year in lieu of amortization  we will be required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operation and financial position 
our evaluation may result in an impairment under this new method of evaluating goodwill 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization  the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required 
pro forma financial information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings releases and investor conference calls 
our pro forma financial information does not include unusual or non recurring events or transactions or amortization of goodwill 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 effective june  
table of contents  requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted under the purchase method 
the pooling of interests method of accounting can no longer be used for business combinations completed after june  the provisions of sfas no 
are similar to prior generally accepted accounting principles gaap  although sfas no 
requires additional disclosures for transactions occurring after the effective date 
under sfas no 
 we will continue to immediately write off in process research and development 
sfas no 
eliminates the amortization of goodwill for business combinations completed after june  effective february   goodwill will no longer be amortized  but is required to be assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
sfas no 
also provides additional guidance on acquired intangibles that should be separately recognized and amortized  which may result in the recognition of additional intangible assets as compared with prior gaap 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will no longer amortize goodwill  thereby eliminating annual goodwill amortization of approximately  we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment in fiscal to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that a charge  if any  related to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal will be significant 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
no later than the year beginning after december   and plan to adopt its provisions for the first quarter of fiscal ending april  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on our financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
pertaining to assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial condition  consolidated results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure 
table of contents to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our financial statements 
equity price risk our short term investments consist primarily of balances maintained in a non qualified deferred compensation plan funded by our executives and directors 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings 
we have also invested in equity instruments of swissqual  a privately held company 
we evaluate whether any decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary 
we had no such impairments during fiscal due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs  or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
