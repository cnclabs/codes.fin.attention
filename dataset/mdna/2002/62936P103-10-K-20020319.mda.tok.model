item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read this discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview our objective is to build a profitable biopharmaceutical company by discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins 
our product candidates are primarily for the treatment of bone and mineral disorders  gastrointestinal disorders and central nervous system disorders 
we have product drug candidates in active clinical development and several preclinical product candidates 
we have incurred cumulative losses from inception through december  of approximately million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects  particularly our clinical trial programs for preos and alx  as we maintain our contractual commitment to fund research activities in our metabolic glutamate receptor program  and as we develop internal marketing and sales capabilities and manufacturing relationships 
on december  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of allelix biopharmaceuticals inc  a biopharmaceutical company based in ontario  canada for  shares of our common stock and assumed options and warrants for the issuance of an additional  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  with an effective date of december  accordingly  operating results of allelix are only included in our consolidated statements of operations for periods after that date 
we did  however  record an expense of million in for in process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of allelix 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all of our revenues have come from license fees and research and development support or milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
these revenues fluctuate from year to year 
our revenues were million in  million in  and million in the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to the recognition of milestone payments from our licensees amgen inc  kirin brewery company  ltd  forest laboratories  inc  and janssen pharmaceutica nv the increases in revenues in from were primarily due to revenues from license agreements we acquired as a result of our purchase of allelix 
we recognized revenue from our agreements as follows 
under our agreement with glaxosmithkline we recognized  in  million in  and million in  
under our agreement with kirin  we recognized million in and million in each of and  
under our agreement with amgen we recognized million in and  in each of and  
under our agreement with forest  we recognized million in   in and nothing in  
under our agreement with lilly canada  we recognized million in  and nothing in each of and  
under our agreement with janssen  we recognized million in  million in  and nothing in  and 
under our research funding agreement with the government of canada  we recognized million in   in and nothing in research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs of our personnel who are dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside professionals to conduct research  clinical studies and trials  and for manufacturing of drug compounds and related supplies prior to fda approval 
our research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in research and development expenses increased from to principally due to an increase in the number of patients participating in a pivotal phase iii clinical trial for preos  the increased manufacturing of preos  and the ongoing pilot phase ii study with alx in patients with short bowel syndrome 
the increase from to was principally due to the commencement of the phase iii clinical trial for preos and the pilot phase ii clinical trial for alx general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  business insurance  taxes  professional fees  and market research and promotion activities for our product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase from to was primarily the result of increased costs of our operations  including our acquisition of allelix in december  and a charge of  for compensation expense for stock options held by management that vested on the signing of a license agreement in amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles 
we are required to amortize goodwill and other acquired intangibles as a result of our acquisition of allelix in december the remaining intangible assets at december  totaled approximately million 
we are amortizing these assets over their expected lives  which range from two to six years at the time of acquisition 
we recorded amortization expense of million in compared to million in we did not record any amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles in since the effective date of the allelix acquisition for accounting purposes was december  beginning january   we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and in process research and development acquired 
we recorded an expense of million in for in process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of allelix 
the acquired in process research and development consisted of five drug development programs  of which preos  for osteoporosis  and alx  for gastrointestinal disorders  accounted for percent of the total value 
since the date of the acquisition  we revised our plans for the next series of clinical trials for preos and alx we started a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with preos 
we also started enrolling a small number of patients in a pilot phase ii clinical trial with alx since the date of acquisition and through december   we have incurred development costs of approximately million for preos and million for alx total development costs and time to completion for each of these product candidates will depend on the costs we incur to conduct current clinical trials and to perform any additional work we find necessary to obtain fda approval 
we believe the assumptions we used in the valuation of the in process research and development we acquired from allelix were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
however  we have modified our development plans  as new data have become available regarding each product candidate 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results in the valuation 
total other income  net 
our total other income  net  increased to million in from million in and million in the increase from to and from to was mainly the result of increased interest income of million in and million in the increase in interest income is the result of higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities 
these balances increased primarily due to proceeds we received from the private placement offering of million shares of our common stock which was closed in april and from a public offering of million shares of our common stock which was completed in november in addition  the gain on sale of marketable investment securities increased by million in and by  in due to a decreasing interest rate environment resulting in larger realized gains on marketable investment securities 
finally  during  we recognized income of million from an equity method investment 
in  we recognized million loss on disposition of equipment  leasehold improvements  and leases 
the loss on disposition of equipment  leasehold improvements  and leases in is primarily due to a loss of approximately million associated with closing a facility in new jersey following the acquisition of allelix 
we anticipated at the time of the acquisition that we would sublease the facility for the remaining nine year term of our lease obligation and retain the existing leasehold improvements 
however  we were able to negotiate a release of our obligation from the landlord subject to our forfeiting the leasehold improvements and certain office furniture and equipment which had a net book value of approximately million 
taxes as of december   we had a united states federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a united states federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
we also had a canadian federal and provincial income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and million  respectively  a canadian research pool carryforward of approximately million and a canadian investment tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
our ability to utilize the united states operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of cumulative effect on prior years to december  of changing to a different revenue recognition method 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition sab no 

sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
under our previous accounting policy  revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees were recognized when received when we had no further obligations relative to such licensing fees 
in compliance with sab no 
 we now recognize revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees over the continuing involvement period with each licensee 
the adoption of sab no 
resulted in an increase in operating income of  and no change in the net loss for the year ended december  prior year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle 
future outlook we estimate that revenues in the first quarter of will be approximately  from existing research and development funding and license agreements 
in january  forest notified us that we had earned a million milestone payment as a result of the achievement of certain preclinical and clinical developments 
forest approved issuance of a press release by us announcing that event 
in march  we received notice from forest that it was terminating the agreement and returning all rights to alx to us 
forest also indicated that it believes this obviates its obligation to pay the million milestone payment 
we disagree with this assertion and are evaluating arbitration as provided under the agreement 
nevertheless  we will not recognize revenue for the million milestone payment in the first quarter 
we expect that research and development expenses in the first quarter of will be between and million and general and administrative expenses will be between and million 
we expect amortization of purchased intangibles to be approximately  and other income  net  to be between million and million 
on a per quarter basis during  we anticipate that research and development expenses will fluctuate between and million as we conduct current and planned clinical studies for preos and anticipated clinical trials for alx and as we increase our pre launch manufacturing and market development costs for these product candidates 
quarter to quarter fluctuations may be significant for both revenues and expenses  but we anticipate that our operations will use between and million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities in this guidance reflects the substantial increase in our enrollment in the top clinical trial for osteoporosis over earlier expected targets  the planned pace and scope of the top and other clinical trials and planned manufacturing arrangements for preos 
any changes to current plans for clinical trials or manufacturing could have an impact on cash expenditures in liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public issuance and sale of equity securities 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative revenues from payments for research support  license fees and milestone payments and million from the sale of equity securities for cash 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities  which totaled million at december  the primary objectives for the company s marketable investment security portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return to the company  consistent with these two objectives 
the company s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
we could receive future milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate if each of our current licensees accomplishes the specified research and or development milestones provided in the respective agreements 
in addition  all of the agreements require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products covered by the terms of our license agreements 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone and royalty payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
some of the late stage development milestone payments from astrazeneca will not be due if we elect a co promotion option under which we may commercialize products 
further  each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee either for any reason or under certain conditions 
prior to the time that we acquired allelix in december  allelix had entered into a research funding agreement with the government of canada pursuant to the technology partnership canada program 
under this agreement  canada is obligated to reimburse us for up to percent of eligible research and development costs we incur for our alx product candidate through december up to a maximum of cdn 
million 
as of december   we had invoiced canada for a total of cdn 
million for reimbursement 
the agreement provides canada with a percent royalty on revenues we receive from the sale or license of alx our royalty obligation terminates on december  if we have paid at least cdn 
million 
if we have not paid that amount by that date  our royalty obligation continues until the earlier of the date we have paid cdn 
million or december  the agreement contains a number of significant limitations on our ability to develop and commercialize alx outside of canada 
we have entered into sponsored research  license  and purchase agreements that obligate us to make research support and milestone payments to academic or commercial research institutions and individuals 
as of december   we have a total commitment of up to million for future research support and milestone payments 
further  depending on the commercial success of certain of our products  we may be required to pay license fees or royalties 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  we are required to co direct the research and pay for an equal share of the research costs  including personnel and capital  through at least september and  under certain circumstances  through march additionally  as of december   we have a non cancelable commitment for future manufacturing of preos of approximately million over a four year period commencing in june we expect to enter into additional collaborative research agreements and manufacturing agreements in the future  which may require long term commitments of cash 
we expect that our existing capital resources including interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through at least however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  especially with regard to the clinical trial programs and pre launch market development and production costs for preos and alx if we advance current proprietary programs  if we in license or otherwise acquire other technologies  product candidates or companies  or if current clinical trials are accelerated  delayed or terminated for any reason  we may need to make substantial additional expenditures or we may need to substantially reduce planned expenditures 
our clinical trials may be accelerated  delayed  or terminated for several reasons including the risk that our product candidates will demonstrate safety concerns  the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical trials to be performed  and the risk that contract manufacturers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to support our clinical trials  which could lead to a cessation of the clinical trials 
we do not have on hand sufficient supplies of our product candidates to meet our clinical trial requirements and we are dependent on outside contract manufacturers to provide these supplies on a timely basis 
if any of the events that pose these risks comes to fruition  we may have to substantially curtail or postpone current and planned clinical trials  our business may be materially harmed  our stock price may be adversely affected  and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired 
we need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long term research  product development  and commercialization programs 
to provide for financial flexibility and increased liquidity  the company filed a shelf registration statement in january under the shelf registration statement  the company may offer up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depository shares  and or warrants  with terms to be determined by market conditions 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  collaborations  or license agreements and other financing mechanisms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or to obtain funds through arrangements with licensees or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows 
revenue recognition  
accounting for income taxes  and 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we earn our revenue from research and development support payments  license fees  and milestone payments 
as described below  significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 to all of our revenue transactions 
we recognize revenue from our research and development support agreements as related research and development costs are incurred and from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the amount of the milestone payment  approximates the value of achieving the milestone 
we recognize nonrefundable license fees over the period we have continuing involvement 
cash received in advance of the performance of the related research and development support and for nonrefundable license fees when we have continuing involvement is recorded as deferred revenue 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation expense for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to reduce our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and 
our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets  and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of beginning january   we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill and the assembled work force component of identifiable intangible assets was million and  respectively  for the year ended december  the assembled workforce component of identifiable intangible assets was fully amortized as of december  we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and is applicable to all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
also specifies that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet certain criteria to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized effective january   rather  these assets must be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
beginning january   we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas nos 
and amortization expense related to goodwill and the assembled work force component of identifiable intangible assets was million and  respectively  for the year ended december  and the assembled workforce component of identifiable intangible assets was fully amortized as of december  we expect to complete our impairment review of goodwill during the first quarter of and do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed  a material impairment charge may not be recorded 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending march  to accomplish this  we must identify legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
because of the effort necessary to comply with the adoption of sfas no 
 it is not practicable for management to estimate the impact of adopting this statement as of the date of this report on form k 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
we are required and we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending march  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
we cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
after a review of our marketable investment securities  we believe that in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist mainly of highly liquid  investment grade securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component in stockholders equity 
foreign currency risk 
some of our research and development operations are in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar  or by weak economic conditions in canada 
when the united states dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada decreases 
when the united states dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada increases 
the monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary that are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities 
a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar from the december  rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in canada to change by an insignificant amount 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
