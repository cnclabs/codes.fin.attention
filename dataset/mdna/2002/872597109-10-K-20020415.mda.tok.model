overview acquisition of gateway technologies  inc 
on june   we completed our merger with gateway technologies  inc or gateway by exchanging  shares of our common stock for all of the common stock of gateway 
each share of gateway was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
in addition  outstanding gateway stock options were converted at the same exchange rate into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the merger constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests under accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  all prior period information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of t netix and gateway as though gateway had always been a part of t netix 
in addition  in connection with the merger transaction  t netix issued  shares of common stock to certain shareholders of gateway in exchange for the termination of a royalty agreement with gateway 
the royalty agreement related to automated call processing technology and intellectual property rights that were assigned to gateway by the royalty owners in exchange for royalty payments 
the termination of the royalty owners interests resulted in the acquisition of an intangible asset 
the asset was recorded at fair value  or million 
the fair value was based on the value of t netix common stock at february  date of the merger agreement  or  multiplied by the number of shares issued in exchange for termination of the royalty owners interests 
the intangible asset has an estimated useful life of years  the remaining term of the underlying patent 
corrections division in the corrections division we derive revenue from three main sources telecommunications services  direct call provisioning and equipment sales 
each form of revenue has specific and varying operating costs associated with such revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses  along with research and development and depreciation and amortization are common expenses regardless of the revenue generated 
telecommunications services revenue is generated under long term contracts generally  three to five years with our telecommunications service provider customers including verizon  at t  sbc communications  qwest and sprint 
here  we provide the equipment  security enhanced call processing  call validation  and service and support through the provider  rather than directly to the facility 
the provider does the billing 
we are paid a prescribed fee by our telecommunications services providers for each call completed 
we receive additional fees for validating the phone numbers dialed by inmates 
our corrections division also provides our inmate calling services directly as a certified telecommunications provider to correctional facilities  or direct customers 
in a typical arrangement  we operate under site specific contracts  generally for a period of two to three years 
we provide the equipment  security enhanced call processing  call validation  and customer service and support directly to the facility 
we then use the services of third parties to bill the calls on the called party s local exchange carrier bill 
direct call provisioning revenue is substantially higher than the percentage of revenue or transaction based pricing compensation associated with telecommunications services because we receive the entire retail value of the collect call 
due to commissions and other operating costs  including uncollectible costs  the gross margin percentage from this model are lower than our telecommunication service arrangements 
equipment sales and other revenue include the sales of our inmate calling system primarily the systems of our wholly owned subsidiary  telequip labs  inc  and digital recording systems 
currently  sales of inmate calling systems are generally made by telequip to a limited number of telecommunication service provider customers 
we experienced an increase in total revenue in from of approximately million or an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to new pricing agreements with four of our telecommunications services provider customers during the second half of we will continue to market our products and services to other telecommunication service providers  however  we expect growth in call processing volumes and corresponding telecommunications services revenue will come predominately from adding new systems for existing customers and from the sale of other corrections related products and services 
internet services division in december  we entered into a master service agreement with us west enterprise now named qwest america  inc the qwest agreement to provide interlata internet services to qwest customers 
the qwest agreement  which commenced december   called for us to buy  resell and process billing of internet bandwidth to these customers 
the initial term of the qwest agreement was for a minimum of sixteen months until march although the qwest agreement expired on march  we continued providing services under the agreement through october effective november  substantially all services under this agreement had ceased 
factors affecting margin include a negotiated base management fee and contract incentive payments based on cost savings 
the costs associated with this contract are primarily the costs for internet bandwidth 
there were no capital outlays required to begin provisioning these services 
speaker verification division all periods reflect the operating results of our speakez voice verification division as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of balance sheet presentation  the current assets and their related liabilities have been reclassified and netted to net assets of discontinued operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations current operations during  we experienced a net loss of million  which was equal to our operating results in while we achieved a million improvement in the operating results of continuing operations during  this improvement was offset by a million increased loss in discontinued operations and a million increase in income tax expense 
in august  the company formalized the decision to offer for sale it s voice verification business unit  which includes the speakez speaker verification products 
accordingly  related operating results have been reported as discontinued operations 
the increased loss in discontinued operations during resulted primarily from a one time charge of million  net of taxes  in related to the write off of the voice print patent and license assets related to the speakez product line 
this write off was based on an analysis which concluded that the carrying value of our voice print assets exceeded the present value of estimated future cash flows given current operating results and the absence of a definitive agreement to sell these assets 
we continue to aggressively pursue new contracts in our corrections division through our sales and marketing efforts 
any new agreement will require investments in new installations that  due to the long term nature of our contracts  do not produce immediate profitability but will contribute to future profitability 
additionally  we have implemented a business plan that we believe will improve operational efficiencies and will help improve overall margins

total revenue for was million  an increase of over million for the corresponding period 
this increase was attributable to increases in telecommunications services of million  internet services of million and equipment sales and other of million  offset in part by decreases in direct provisioning of million 
telecommunications services revenue increased to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the corresponding prior period  due primarily to an increase in contract prices 
we increased our per call transaction fee with a major customer and we changed our pricing with three other major customers whereby revenue is calculated as a percentage of our customer s gross revenue versus a transaction fee per call 
in addition  we experienced an increase in revenue due to a full year of price increases in combined with an increase in call volume  primarily due to the addition of new sites 
direct call provisioning revenue decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   from million in the corresponding prior period 
this decrease was primarily due to the loss of sites for which we are provisioning the long distance service 
the loss of sites is a result of our being unsuccessful in providing competitive bidding arrangements for contracts directly with correctional institutions 
internet services revenue increased to million for the twelve month period ending december   from the million in the corresponding prior period 
the increase was a result of an increase in the base of internet services subscribers 
although the qwest agreement expired on march   we continued providing services under this agreement through october effective november  operations of this segment have substantially ceased including those under the qwest agreement 
equipment sales and other revenue increased to million for the twelve month period ending december  from million in the corresponding prior period 
this increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of telequip labs  inc  an inmate equipment provider  in january the telequip sales of equipment are primarily associated with a limited number of telecommunication service providers and revenue associated with such sales are dependent upon the timing of sales and installations for these customers 
operating costs 
total operating costs increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in the corresponding prior period 
the increase was primarily due to increases in telecommunication services of million and cost of equipment sold of million  offset partially by a reduction in internet services of million and the direct call provisioning expenses of 
million  respectively 
operating costs of telecommunications services primarily consist of service administration costs for correctional facilities  including salaries and related personnel expenses  communication costs and inmate calling systems repair and maintenance expenses 
operating costs of telecommunications services also includes costs associated with call validation procedures  primarily network expenses and database access charges 
operating costs associated with direct call provisioning include the costs associated with telephone line access  long distance charges  commissions paid to correctional facilities  costs associated with uncollectible accounts and billing charges 
internet services operating costs consist of purchased internet bandwidth costs 
the following table sets forth the operating costs and expenses for each type of revenue as a percentage of corresponding revenue for the twelve months ended december  and operating costs and expenses telecommunications services direct call provisioning internet services cost of equipment sold and other operating costs associated with providing telecommunications services as a percentage of corresponding revenue was for the twelve months ended december   a decrease from for the comparable period 
total telecommunications services operating costs were million for the twelve months ended december  and million for the corresponding prior period 
the increase in is due to new services being provisioned for significant customers as part of contract amendments  increases in personnel costs  communications expenses and repairs and maintenance 
direct call provisioning costs as a percentage of applicable revenue increased to of revenue for the twelve months ended december  from in for the corresponding prior period 
this increase was primarily due to a higher level of uncollectibles as a percentage of total revenue 
internet services costs as a percentage of applicable revenue decreased to of revenue for the twelve months ended december  from for the corresponding prior period 
the decrease in costs is due to the termination of the qwest agreement in october  offset partially by an increased line costs as a result of more subscribers 
cost of equipment sold and other as a percentage of applicable revenue increased to of revenue for the twelve months ended december  from for the corresponding prior period 
this increase was primarily due to the change in the revenue mix for equipment and other sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the corresponding prior period 
the increase in the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in personnel costs  severance benefits  contract labor  travel  communications and legal fees 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the corresponding prior period 
impairment of telecommunications assets 
during  we recorded an impairment of telecommunications assets charge of million 
this impairment charge consisted of a reduction in the carrying value of software development costs and the write off of goodwill associated with our contain r and lock track tm jail management system products 
while these products have been offered for several years  we have experienced limited commercial success with these products and revenues to date have not been significant 
management has been seeking strategic alternatives for these product lines  including the possible sale  investing significantly to upgrade and enhance the current product offering  or increase sales and marketing support to enhance sales 
while we will still offer these products as part of our corrections division product line  management has determined that it is not cost justified to invest additional capital or operating funds in these products 
this impairment charge was based upon an analysis which concluded that the carrying value of software development costs and other intangible assets associated with these product lines exceeded the present value of estimated future cash flows given current sales levels 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december   an increase from million for the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to the depreciation associated with new site installations 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expense was million for the twelve months ended december  and included in interest and other expense is other income in the twelve months ended december  is a gain of approximately million on the sale of used telecommunications equipment 
interest expense was million for the twelve months ended december  and million for the corresponding prior period 
the decrease in was attributable to a decrease in the average amount of indebtedness outstanding 
the average debt balance decreased primarily due to the pay down of debt as the result of improved operating income 
results of operations for the years ended december  and the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december  and revenue telecommunications services direct call provisioning internet services equipment sales and other total revenue expenses operating costs selling  general and administrative research and development impairment of telecommunications assets depreciation and amortization operating income loss merger transaction expenses interest and other expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations accretion of discount on redeemable convertible preferred stock net income loss applicable to common stockholders total revenue 
total revenue in was million  an increase of over million in this revenue increase was attributable to increases in internet services of million due to the qwest agreement being in effect for the entire year of  increases in telecommunications services revenue of million and direct call provisioning revenue of million  partially offset by decreases in equipment sales and other of million 
telecommunications services revenue increased to million in from million in due primarily to an increase in contract pricing 
in addition  we experienced an increase in revenue due to higher call volumes from the addition of new sites 
direct call provisioning revenue increased to million in from million in this increase was due to the addition of sites for which we are provisioning the long distance service 
the addition of sites is primarily the result of our being successful in competitive bidding arrangements for contracts directly with correctional institutions 
internet services revenue increased  to million in from million in this increase was largely attributable to a full year of operating results for this segment in the primary contract for internet services  the qwest agreement  commenced in december equipment sales and other revenue decreased to million for from million in this reduction was primarily due to lower equipment sales in to a telecommunications service provider customer 
operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses were million in  an increase of from million in the increase in was primarily due to the commencement of the internet services segment combined with increases in telecommunication services and direct call provisioning costs  offset partially by a reduction in the cost of equipment sold and other expenses 
operating costs of telecommunications services primarily consist of service administration costs for correctional facilities  including salaries and related personnel expenses  communication costs and inmate calling systems repair and maintenance expense 
operating costs of telecommunications services also includes costs associated with call validation procedures  primarily network expenses and database access charges

telecommunications services operating costs for and were million  and million  respectively 
the increase from to was due primarily to new services being provisioned for a significant customer as part of a contract amendment and to an increase in personnel costs 
the increase included bonus costs associated with our line installation bonus program 
the bonus program ended june  also  the addition of new personnel in the national service center and other operational support functions contributed to cost increases 
to a lesser extent  increases in travel  consulting services  repairs and maintenance contributed to the overall cost increase 
operating costs and expenses associated with providing direct call provisioning as a percentage of corresponding revenue was in and in the decrease in was primarily due to a lower level of uncollectible expense resulting from improved collection efforts 
operating costs and expenses associated with providing internet services as a percentage of corresponding revenue was in and in the decrease is largely due to a full year operating results for this segment in the contract for internet services  the qwest agreement  commenced in december cost of equipment sold and other decreased to million in from million in this decrease was largely attributable to the reduction in equipment sales in to one telecommunication service provider customer compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits for additional personnel and the implementation of a performance bonus program 
other expenses increased due to travel  communications  and professional fees due to the integration of gateway operations 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in versus million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses and higher travel and consulting costs 
impairment of telecommunications assets 
during  we recorded an impairment of telecommunications assets of million 
impaired telecommunications assets consisted of software development costs  construction in progress  and inmate calling platform assets 
two events indicated that the carrying value of certain equipment and intangible assets might not be recoverable 
in september  we completed an evaluation of the future viability of our new inmate calling platform dl platform  which we had been developing over the past two years 
the merger with gateway allowed us to consider an alternative to the dl platform 
we determined that the gateway combridge platform combridge would be the preferred platform to install for both new customers and upgrades of existing customers 
however  during  we had been awarded certain contracts where the dl platform was to be deployed 
since we believe that it would not be cost effective to maintain and support two separate systems  we proceeded to renegotiate all existing contracts to install combridge instead of the dl platform 
during the quarter ended september   we successfully completed these negotiations 
due to the abandonment of the dl platform  we no longer anticipated any cash flow to support the carrying value of assets related to the dl platform 
capitalized costs relating to the dl platform included the software development costs  components consisting primarily of telephony cards and other supporting computer peripheral equipment 
as a result  software development costs at december  were impaired by million and certain components of construction in progress relating to these products were impaired by million 
this charge was applicable to the corrections division 
in addition  we had deployed a version of our old inmate calling platform that resides in our customers network locations 
during  we experienced a reduction in call volumes and revenues for this platform 
additionally  since the platform was based on the predecessor to the dl platform  it was determined that no upgrade path would be available for the platform 
any new feature or service offering would be evaluated based on the new combridge platform 
the reduction in call volumes caused the estimated fair value of these assets to be less than its existing book value 
we estimated the fair value of these assets based on the discounted cash flows from each location 
after consideration of minimal salvage value of these assets due to their specific use  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
this charge was applicable to the corrections division 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million in  versus million in the increase was due primarily to the depreciation of fixed assets placed in service in merger transaction expenses 
these expenses were directly related to the merger with gateway and amounted to approximately million in merger transaction expenses consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  financial printing and other related charges 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expense was million in  versus million in included in interest and other expense is other income in and were gains of approximately million and million  respectively  on the sale of used telecommunications equipment 
interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to an increase in the average amount of indebtedness outstanding and an increase in interest rates 
the average debt balance increased in primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically relied upon operating cash flow  debt financing and the sale of equity securities to fund our operations and capital needs 
our capital needs consist primarily of additions to property and equipment for site telecommunication equipment  upgrades to existing systems and to fund acquisitions 
cash provided by continuing operations increased by to million for from million in  primarily due to a million improvement in net income from continuing operations combined with a million increase in net working capital and the million impairment charge in cash provided by continuing operations declined to million for from million in primarily due to a million decrease in net working capital and the million impairment charge in  offset partially by a million improvement in net income from continuing operations 
net cash used in investing activity of continuing operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment of million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in and spending was the result of a lower level of new calling system installations and upgrades to existing systems  as compared to levels 
cash used for acquisitions totaled million in and million in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the sale of surplus equipment of million in both and we anticipate that our capital expenditures in will increase over levels based on our anticipated growth in installed systems at correctional facilities 
we believe our cash flows from operations and our availability under our credit facility will be sufficient in order for us to meet our anticipated cash needs for new installations of inmate call processing systems  upgrades of existing systems  and to finance our operations for at least the next months 
due primarily to repayments on our credit facility  cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was million during this repayment was largely the result of improved operating performance and lower spending on property and equipment in than in prior years 
cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of million in consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock of million and subordinated debt of million  less net payments on the credit facility and other debt of million 
cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of million in reflects the net proceeds from debt  including the line of credit of million 
capital resources in september  we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility with a commercial bank for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in july our lenders amended our credit agreement to revise certain financial covenants 
the maximum available amount of credit under the credit facility available was dependent upon our financial performance 
based on these financial covenants  our maximum borrowings at december  were million 
in april our lenders extended the credit facility maturity date to march  the maximum available borrowing on the facility was reduced to million consisting of a million term portion and a million line of credit 
interest was set at prime rate plus effective march   increasing by each quarter thereafter on june  september  and december  as of december  
in addition  monthly payments of million on the term loan commenced on april  in march the maturity date of our credit facility was extended to june  maximum available borrowing from the facility was reduced to million  consisting of a million term portion and a million line of credit 
interest was set at prime plus  effective march  in addition  monthly payments of million on the term loan will continue through the maturity date 
further  the company  in april  obtained a commitment from the bank to extend  at the option of t netix  this facility beyond june  to january the credit facility under this commitment requires interest payments  principal and borrowing base reductions and banking fees 
the company has retained jp morgan securities inc to explore and advise us on various financing opportunities and strategies 
in april  we raised million of debt and equity financing 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the credit facility 
the company issued  shares of series a non voting redeemable convertible preferred stock and five year stock purchase warrants to acquire  common shares for net proceeds of million 
in november  shares of the preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in february of the remaining  shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock at an average conversion price of 
the unamortized discount on the preferred stock of million was recognized as a charge to income loss applicable to common stockholders 
the company also issued a subordinated note payable of million  due april   to a director and significant shareholder of the company 
the note bears interest at prime rate plus one percent per annum at december  which is payable every six months 
the lender received warrants  which are immediately exercisable  to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for a period of five years 
this note was extended in april to april   at which time the lender received additional warrants  which are immediately exercisable  to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for a period of five years 
in march  this note was extended to july  in april this note was extended to february to facilitate the refinancing of our overall financing structure 
warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at market price  on the previous terms  have been issued to mr

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in general  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  and requires that all intangible assets acquired  other than those acquired in a business combination  be initially recognized and measured based on fair value 
in addition  the intangible assets should be amortized based on useful life 
if the intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life  it should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment at least annually 
for the years ended december  and  amortization expense for goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
management has not determined the potential impact that this statement will have on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and reported as a liability 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of sfas critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the significant accounting policies of the company are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies as discussed below require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that could materially affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
revenue from telecommunications services and direct call provisioning is recognized at the time the telephone call is completed 
revenue from equipment sales is recognized when the equipment is shipped to customers  while revenue from internet services is recognized when the services are provided 
the company records deferred revenue for advance billings to customers  or prepayments by customers prior to the completion of installation or prior to the provision of contractual bandwidth usage 
in evaluating the collectibility of its trade receivables from telecommunications services and direct call provisioning customers  the company assesses a number of factors including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  the company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectibles to reduce the related receivables to the amount the company ultimately expects to collect from customers 
if circumstances related to specific customers change or economic conditions worsen such that the company s past collection experience is no longer relevant  the company s estimate of the recoverability of its trade receivables could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of amortization expense is based on the cost and estimated economic useful lives of the underlying intangible assets  including goodwill  intellectual property assets  capitalized computer software  and patent defense and applications costs 
the company reviews its unamortized intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life has been reduced 
the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from operations and if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  the company recognizes an impairment loss by reducing the unamortized cost of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
although the company believes it is unlikely that any significant changes in the carrying value or the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets will occur in the near term  rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and the company s future consolidated operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as discussed below 
interest rate risk we have current debt outstanding under the credit facility of million at december  under the terms of the debt agreement the maximum credit available at december  is million 
the loan bears interest at prime rate plus at december  with interest payable monthly 
since the interest rate on the loan outstanding is variable and is reset periodically  we are exposed to interest risk 
an increase in interest rates of would increase estimated annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december
