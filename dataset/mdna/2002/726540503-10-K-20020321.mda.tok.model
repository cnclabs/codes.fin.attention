item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general before the second quarter of we were engaged in two related lines of business within the energy industry 
the first line of business  referred to as upstream  acquires  exploits  develops  explores and produces crude oil and natural gas 
the second line of business  referred to as midstream  engaged in the marketing  transportation and terminalling of crude oil 
our midstream business was conducted through our majority ownership in paa 
for financial statement purposes  for the years prior to  the assets  liabilities and earnings of paa were included in our consolidated financial statements  with the public unitholders interest reflected as a minority interest 
june strategic restructuring on june   we sold a portion of our interests in paa to a group of investors and management of paa for approximately million 
the assets we sold in this restructuring included  or approximately million  of the subordinated units of paa  at per unit  and an aggregate ownership interest in the general partner of paa 
we received approximately million in cash and  shares of our series f preferred stock valued at million as consideration for the sale 
we recognized a pre tax gain of million in connection with this sale 
in connection with our strategic restructuring  the holders of the remaining shares of our series f preferred stock converted their shares into million shares of our common stock and received from us a cash payment of approximately million  equal to  with respect to each share of our series f preferred stock converted  the accrued dividends on each share from june  until the first date on which we could cause conversion of the shares  plus a premium on the amount of the accrued dividends 
also  in connection with our strategic restructuring  holders of our series h preferred stock converted an aggregate of  shares into approximately million shares of our common stock 
we also granted management of paa an option to acquire an additional ownership interest in the general partner of paa  which paa management exercised in september by paying us million in cash and notes 
as a result of this exercise we recognized a gain of million 
as a result of our strategic restructuring  all of our series f preferred stock and all but approximately  shares of our series h preferred stock were retired or converted 
the remaining outstanding shares of our series h preferred stock were converted into million shares of our common stock during the third quarter of the excess of the fair value of our series f preferred stock redeemed as consideration over the carrying value of such series f preferred stock million is deemed to be a dividend to our preferred stockholders 
as a result  for purposes of determining our basic and diluted earnings per share  we deducted this amount in determining our income available to our common stockholders 
in exchange for the significant value we received for the subordinated units which are subordinated in right to distributions from paa and are not publicly traded relative to the then current market price of the publicly traded common units  we entered into a value assurance agreement with each of the purchasers of the subordinated units 
the value assurance agreements require us to pay to the holders an amount per fiscal year  payable on a quarterly basis  equal to the difference between per unit and the actual amount distributed during that period 
the value assurance agreements will expire upon the earlier of the conversion of the subordinated units to common units  or june  also in connection with our strategic restructuring 
we appointed james c 
flores as our chairman of the board and chief executive officer and we appointed a new chief operating officer  chief financial officer  and general counsel and secretary  
certain of our employees received transaction related bonuses and other payments and vested in benefits in accordance with the terms of our employee benefit plans  
we entered into a separation agreement with paa whereby  among other things  we agreed to indemnify paa  its general partner  and its subsidiaries against a any claims related to the upstream business  whenever arising  and b any claims related to federal or state securities laws or the regulations of any self regulatory authority  or other similar claims  resulting from alleged acts or omissions by us  our subsidiaries  paa  or paa s subsidiaries occurring on or before june   and paa agreed to indemnify us and our subsidiaries against any claims related to the midstream business  whenever arising  
we entered into a pension and employee benefits assumption and transition agreement pursuant to which we and the general partner of paa agreed to the transition of certain employees to the general partner  our provision of certain benefits with respect to the transfer  and our provision of transition related services  
with respect to certain of our employees who transferred to the general partner of paa and who held in the money but unvested stock options to acquire our common stock  which were subject to forfeiture due to the transfer of employment  we agreed to substitute for the unvested options a total contingent grant of  subordinated units with a value equal to the discounted present value of the spread on the unvested options  to vest on the same vesting schedule as the options  as a result of which we recognized million in noncash compensation expense  and 
we agreed to contribute  subordinated units to the general partner of paa to be used for performance option grants to officers and key employees of the general partner 
as a result of our reduced ownership of paa and our inability to control paa s operations  our minority interest in paa is accounted for using the equity method of accounting effective january  under this method  we no longer consolidate the assets  liabilities and operating activities of paa 
rather  we record our proportionate share of paa s net assets and results of operations 
as of december   our aggregate ownership interest in paa was approximately  which was comprised of a interest in the general partner of paa   or approximately million  of the subordinated units and  or approximately million  of the common units  including approximately million class b common units 
based on paa s current annual distribution rate of per unit  we would receive an annual distribution from paa of approximately million  including million for our of the general partner incentive distribution 
the general partner of paa is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount paa distributes with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in paa s partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  generally the general partner is entitled to of distributions in excess of per unit  of distributions in excess or per unit and of distributions in excess of per unit 
based on the current annual distribution level quarterly and the current units outstanding  the general partner s incentive distribution is forecast to be approximately million  of which we would receive

during the year ended december   our operating revenues from oil  natural gas and electricity sales increased by million  from million in to million in the increase primarily reflects more favorable results of our hedging program and higher gas prices 
increased prices contributed million in additional revenue  and increased sales volumes contributed million 
our oil sales volumes increased  from mbbls per day in to mbbls per day in on an as produced basis  our oil volumes increased from mbbls per day in to mbbls per day in our gas sales volumes increased  from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in production increases were primarily attributable to the continuing development of our onshore california properties 
the average realized price for crude oil and liquids increased  from per barrel in to per barrel in hedges that we put into place in the latter part of  when crude oil prices were considerably lower  significantly impacted the realized price 
the average realized price for natural gas increased  from per mcf in to per mcf in this increase is reflective of the well publicized high natural gas prices in california during the first half of our production costs increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes  which accounted for million of the increase 
on a barrel equivalent basis  production costs increased  from per boe in to per boe in  primarily reflecting higher electricity costs in california during the year 
our general and administrative  or g a  expense increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in included in g a is approximately million of nonrecurring costs associated with our june strategic restructuring  of which million was noncash compensation cost primarily associated with the vesting of performance based stock options in connection with our restructuring

our equity in the earnings of paa was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in our ownership interest in as well as nonrecurring gains included in paa s earnings 
at december  our ownership interest in paa was approximately 
primarily as a result of paa s two public unit offerings during  and our june strategic restructuring  our ownership interest was approximately at december  the gain on paa units reflects i million in gains related to the sale of a portion of our investment in paa in connection with our june strategic restructuring  ii million of gains resulting from the increase in the book value of our equity in paa to reflect our proportionate share of the increase in the underlying net assets of paa resulting from paa s public equity offerings  in which we did not participate  and iii a million gain related to the vesting of certain unit grants 
no similar transactions occurred in our interest expense decreased by million  from million to million for the year ended december  compared to  reflecting lower bank debt and lower interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to the gains on paa units discussed above and an increase in our effective tax rate from in to in in we recognized a deferred tax provision of million and a current tax provision of million 
the current tax provision is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of paa units 
for we recognized a deferred tax provision of million and a current tax provision of million 
at december  we have a net deferred tax liability of million  primarily attributable to timing differences between the deductibility of certain costs for book and tax purposes 
the cumulative effects of accounting change recognized for the year ended december  is for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the amount in is for the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  we reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the same period in combined ebitda increased in  to million from the million reported in our operating revenues from oil and natural gas sales were million in  an increase of million over due to higher commodity prices and increased sales volumes  which contributed approximately million and million to the increase  respectively 
our oil sales volumes increased from mbbls per day in to mbbls per day in the volume increase is primarily attributable to a full year of production from our offshore california property that was acquired in mid our gas sales volumes decreased from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in the average realized price for oil increased  from per barrel in to per barrel in the average nymex oil price increased from per barrel in to per barrel in we did not participate in the full amount of this increase as hedges that we put into place in the latter part of  when oil prices were significantly lower  decreased our realized price by per barrel 
the average realized price for gas increased  from per mcf in to per mcf in this increase is reflective of the well publicized high gas prices in california during the latter half of our production costs were million in  an increase of million over due to higher production costs and increased sales volumes  which contributed million and million to the increase  respectively 
on a barrel equivalent basis  production costs increased  from per boe in to per boe in  primarily reflecting a full year of production from our offshore california property  increased gas fuel costs and upward pressure on costs throughout the service industry 
our g a expense increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs and expenses related to our corporate reorganization and million in expenses related to paa s unauthorized trading loss

our income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the same period in the extraordinary items in and relate to the early redemption and refinancing of paa debt 
liquidity and capital resources general cash generated from our upstream operations  paa distributions and our revolving credit facility are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december  we had availability on our revolving credit facility of million 
we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash from operations and  if necessary  borrowing capacity under our credit facility to meet our short term normal recurring operating needs  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
we also believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit facility to meet our long term normal recurring operating needs  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
in  our approximately million of senior subordinated notes will mature 
we believe that we will refinance the senior subordinated notes before they mature  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
cash flows year ended december in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the net increase is primarily attributable to higher realized oil and gas prices and increased sales volumes 
net cash used in operating activities in resulted from the unauthorized trading losses of paa 
investing activities 
in net cash used in investing activities was million 
additions to oil and gas properties and equipment used million in cash  and we made capital contributions to paa of million to maintain our proportionate general partner share of equity offerings by paa 
to maintain its general partner interest  the general partner of paa is required to make a capital contribution each time paa has a new equity offering 
these uses of cash were offset by million in cash proceeds received as a result of our june strategic restructuring 
during investing activities provided cash of million 
proceeds from paa asset sales of million were offset primarily by expenditures of million for crude oil pipeline  gathering and terminal costs and million for upstream acquisition  exploration and development costs 
net cash used in investing activities for included approximately million for midstream acquisitions  primarily for the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions  approximately million for midstream capital costs and for upstream acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development costs

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to eight million shares of our common stock 
during we repurchased million shares for million and in we repurchased million shares for million 
our average cost for the share purchases was per share in and per share in capital expenditures we have made and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  bank borrowings and the issuance of our common stock and our preferred stock 
we intend to make aggregate capital expenditures  including capitalized g a and interest  of approximately million in for exploitation of our existing properties 
in addition  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of underdeveloped producing properties 
we will also be required to make capital contributions to the general partner of paa for any paa equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash from operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund our capital expenditures 
commitments at december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows in thousands thereafter long term debt     operating leases the long term debt amounts consist principally of amounts due under our revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes 
historically  we have renewed and or extended our revolving credit facility prior to commencing scheduled payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to do so in the future 
we believe that we will refinance the senior subordinated notes before they mature  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in connection with our june strategic restructuring  we entered into value assurance agreements with the purchasers of the subordinated units  under the terms of which we will pay the purchasers an amount per fiscal year  payable on a quarterly basis  equal to per unit less the actual amount distributed during that year 
the value assurance agreements will expire upon the earlier of a the conversion of all of the subordinated units to common units or b june  in the first quarter of paa paid a quarterly distribution of per unit annualized

the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility at december  was million and is subject to redetermination from time to time by the lenders in good faith  in the exercise of the lenders sole discretion  and in accordance with customary practices and standards in effect from time to time for crude oil and natural gas loans to borrowers similar to us 
our borrowing base may be affected from time to time by the performance of our oil and natural gas properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
we incur a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
in addition  we pay a fee of per annum of the face amount of letters of credit that are issued under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility terminates on july   at which time the remaining outstanding balance converts to a term loan  repayable in eight equal quarterly installments commencing october   with a final maturity of july  our revolving credit facility bears interest  at our option  of either libor plus or the base rate as defined in our facility 
at december   letters of credit of million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  limit the payment of cash dividends on our common stock  limit repurchases of our common stock  limit the amount of our consolidated debt  limit our ability to make certain loans and investments  and provide that we must maintain a specified relationship between current assets and current liabilities 
in october we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility to allow us to purchase any combination of our own common stock  our senior subordinated notes and paa common units and pay cash dividends on our common stock up to million up to a total of million 
at december  we had million available under this provision of the credit facility

sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
and at this time cannot reasonably estimate the effect of this statement on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab as a result  we record revenue from crude oil production in the period it is sold as opposed to when it is produced and carry any unsold production as inventory valued at historical cost 
the total effect of implementing sab was to reduce reported sales volumes by  barrels for and net income for the year by  including a  reduction for the cumulative effect of prior years 
the effect of this change in accounting for crude oil inventories on prior periods was deminimus 
critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results based on the accounting policies we have in place  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  certain factors may impact our future financial results 
the most significant of these factors and their effect on certain of our accounting policies is discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities prices for oil and gas have historically been volatile 
decreases in oil and gas prices from current levels will adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserves 
if the industry experiences significant prolonged future price decreases  this could be materially adverse to our operations and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures periodically  we enter into hedging arrangements relating to a portion of our oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations 
hedging instruments used are typically fixed price swaps and purchased puts and calls 
while the use of these types of hedging instruments limits our downside risk to adverse price movements  they are subject to a number of risks  including instances in which the benefit to revenues is limited when commodity prices increase 
for a further discussion concerning our risks related to oil and gas prices and our hedging programs  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
write downs under full cost ceiling test rules under the sec s full cost accounting rules we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling equal to the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves including the effect of any related hedging activities  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized net of related tax effects 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flows from our operating activities 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this annual report are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the proved reserve information included in this annual report is based on estimates prepared by outside engineering firms 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than these estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimates of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the ceiling test discussed above 
operating risks and insurance coverage our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of crude oil and natural gas  including blowouts  cratering  oil spills and fires  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of crude oil and natural gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
our operations in california  including transportation of crude oil by pipelines within the city of los angeles  are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury  property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of the area 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against some risks  including earthquake risk in california  either because insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating our pipelines  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
environmental matters as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
these laws and regulations may  among other things  impose liabilities on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean up resulting from operations  subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages  and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
we maintain insurance coverage  which we believe is customary in the industry  although we are not fully insured against all environmental risks 
we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations and have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements  which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry 
although we obtained environmental studies on our properties in california  the sunniland trend and illinois basin  and we believe that such properties have been operated in accordance with standard oil field practices  certain of the fields have been in operation for approximately years  and current or future federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to comply with such rules and regulations 
while we do not believe that compliance with current federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position  there is no assurance that changes in or additions to such laws or regulations will not have such an impact 
consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our crude oil and natural gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
we have estimated that the cost to perform these tasks is approximately million  net of salvage value and other considerations 
such estimated costs are amortized to expense through the unit of production method as a component of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization 
results from operations for  and each include million of expense associated with these estimated future costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in crude oil commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage our exposure  we monitor current economic conditions and our expectations of future commodity prices and interest rates when making decisions with respect to risk management 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas and sfas  or sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or foreign currency hedge 
currently  we use only cash flow hedges and the remaining discussion will relate exclusively to this type of derivative instrument 
if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  or oci  a component of our stockholders equity  to the extent the hedge is effective 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related product is delivered 
if it is determined that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
hedge effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
no amounts were excluded from the computation of hedge effectiveness 
at december   all open positions qualified for hedge accounting 
unrealized gains and losses on hedging instruments reflected in oci and adjustments to carrying amounts on hedged volumes are included in oil and gas revenues in the period that the related volumes are delivered 
gains and losses of hedging instruments which represent hedge ineffectiveness as well as any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized currently in oil and gas revenues 
effective october  we implemented derivatives implementation group  or dig  issue g  cash flow hedges assessing and measuring the effectiveness of a purchased option used in a cash flow hedge  which provides guidance for assessing the effectiveness on total changes in an option s cash flows rather than only on changes in the option s intrinsic value 
implementation of this dig issue g will reduce earnings volatility since it allows us to include changes in the time value of purchased options and collars in the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
time value changes were previously recognized in current earnings since we excluded time value changes from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  include a million non cash loss related to the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges representing the fair value change in the time value of options for the nine months prior to the implementation of dig issue g we utilize various derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on crude oil sales 
the derivative instruments consist primarily of cash settled crude oil option and swap contracts entered into with financial institutions 
we do not currently have any natural gas hedges 
we also utilize interest rate swaps and collars to manage the interest rate exposure on our long term debt 
in october we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement  fixing at the interest rate on million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
on january   in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas  we recorded a gain of million in oci representing the cumulative effect of an accounting change to recognize at fair value all cash flow derivatives  including our equity in the cash flow derivatives of paa 
we recorded cash flow hedge derivative assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  and a net of tax non cash charge of million was recorded in earnings as a cumulative effect adjustment 
for the year ended december  net unrealized gains of million were added to oci and the fair value of open positions increased million 
at december   we had an interest rate swap arrangement to protect interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our outstanding debt 
the position was terminated prior to maturity and as a result million related to such position was relieved from oci 
at december   net unrealized gains on our option and swap contracts included in oci was million 
the related assets and liabilities were included in other current assets million  other assets million  and deferred income taxes million 
additionally  oci includes our million net of tax equity in the unrealized oci losses of paa 
as of december   million of deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in oci are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve month period 
commodity price risk 
at march   we had the following open crude oil hedge positions barrels per day puts average price bbl  calls average price bbl  swaps average price bbl  average price bbl  these positions provide for us to receive for the year ended december  an average minimum nymex price of approximately per barrel on  barrels per day with full upside participation above per barrel on of those hedged barrels  and upside participation above per barrel on of those hedged barrels 
for example  if the nymex index averages during  we will receive per barrel  if the nymex index averages per barrel  we will receive per barrel  if the nymex index averages per barrel  we will receive per barrel  and if the nymex index average were to fall to per barrel we would receive per barrel  all on the hedged barrels 
for  we have entered into various arrangements that provide for us to receive an average fixed nymex price of per barrel on  barrels per day regardless of the nymex index average 
location and quality differentials attributable to our properties and the cost of the hedges are not included in the foregoing prices 
because of the quality and location of our crude oil production  these adjustments will reduce our net price per barrel 
the agreements provide for monthly cash settlement based on the differential between the agreement price and the actual nymex price 
gains or losses are recognized in the month of related production and are included in crude oil and natural gas sales revenues 
such contracts resulted in a reduction of revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had an unrealized gain of million net of tax with respect to such contracts 
the estimated fair value of the hedges is included in our balance sheet at december  the fair value of outstanding derivative commodity instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below in millions december  effect effect of of fair price fair price value decrease value decrease swaps and options contracts futures contracts the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the swap and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market 
none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude oil prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
in the fourth quarter of we terminated our open crude oil put options with enron risk management corp 
and charged earnings for million  representing unamortized premiums for such options 
the contract counterparties for our current derivative commodity contracts are all major financial institutions with standard poor s ratings of a or better 
three of the financial institutions are participating lenders in our revolving credit facility  with one such counterparty holding contracts that represent approximately of the fair value of all open positions at december  our management intends to continue to maintain hedging arrangements for a significant portion of our production 
these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if crude oil prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set  but ceiling prices in our hedges may cause us to receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
interest rate risk 
our debt instruments are sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and the estimated fair value for debt outstanding at december  our variable rate debt bears interest at libor or prime plus the applicable margin 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  the carrying value of variable rate bank debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable  based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of fixed rate debt was based on quoted market prices based on trades of subordinated debt 
expected year of maturity fair thereafter total value dollars in millions long term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt fixed rate average interest rate interest rate swaps are used to hedge underlying debt obligations 
these instruments hedge specific debt issuances and qualify for hedge accounting 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instruments 
at december   we had an interest rate swap for an aggregate notional principal amount of million  for which we would receive approximately million if such arrangement were terminated as of such date 
the swap is based on libor margins and provides for a fixed rate of with an expiration date of october the adjustment to interest expense resulting from interest rate swaps for the years ended december  and was a million loss and a million gain  respectively
