item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at the end of item is a glossary of terms 
item business general benton oil and gas company is an independent energy corporation which has been engaged in the development and production of oil and gas properties since  when it was incorporated under delaware law 
we have developed significant interests in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela and the russian federation russia  and have acquired certain less significant interests in other parts of the world 
our producing operations are conducted principally through our percent owned venezuelan subsidiary  benton vinccler  ca  which operates the south monagas unit in venezuela  and geoilbent ltd  a russian limited liability company of which we own percent  which operates the north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye fields in west siberia  russia 
additionally  we own percent of the equity interest in arctic gas company  of which percent was subject to restrictions on transfer and percent was not subject to restrictions on transfer  as of december  arctic gas was formed to explore and develop the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks in the west siberian basin of russia 
on february   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement transaction to sell our entire percent interest in arctic gas company proposed arctic gas sale to a nominee of the yukos oil company  a russian oil and gas company  for million plus approximately million as repayment of inter company loans owed to us by arctic gas 
we have expanded into other  less significant projects in china  california  and louisiana 
as of december   we had total estimated proved reserves net of minority interest of mmboe  and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow  before income taxes  for total proved reserves of million 
of these totals  the south monagas unit represented mmbbls and million  geoilbent represented mmbbls and million  and arctic gas based on our percent unrestricted ownership represented mmboe and million 
as of december   we had total assets of million 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million  cash flows from operations  before working capital changes  of million  earnings before interest  income taxes and depletion  depreciation and amortization ebitda of million and long term debt of million 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million  cash flows from operations  before working capital changes  of million  ebitda of million and long term debt of million 
we currently have significant debt principal obligations payable in million and million 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on the implementation of our strategic objectives  and in particular the proposed arctic gas sale 
on march   we were notified that the transaction had received the requisite consents from the russian ministry for antimonopoly policy and support for entrepreneurship 
on march   we received the first payment million of the proposed arctic gas sale proceeds 
we expect that all aspects of the transaction will be completed by april while we have no assurance that the transaction will close  the net proceeds should be sufficient to retire early all of our debt service obligation 
see the proposed arctic gas sale if closed can partially reduce the impact of leverage in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the audited financial statements in item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
in the event the proposed arctic gas sale does not close  we will evaluate alternatives with respect to our repayment obligation 
in the meantime  we believe that cash flow from operations  supplemented by other asset sales or borrowings will be adequate to satisfy interest payments on outstanding debt 
however  general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
management  operational and financial restrictions we have taken the necessary steps to strengthen management  improve our operations and enhance our financial flexibility 
in  we completed the following installed new senior management  redefined our strategic priorities to focus on value creation  initiated capital conservation steps and financial transactions  including the proposed arctic gas sale  designed to de leverage the company and improve our cash flow allowing debt retirement and reinvestment  undertook a comprehensive study of our core venezuelan asset which focused on enhancing the value of its production  built the tucupita pipeline in venezuela to reduce transportation costs  sought and received relief from certain restrictive provisions of our debt instruments  reduced our operating expenses  corporate overhead  moved our headquarters to houston and transferred engineering  geological and geophysical activities to our overseas offices  and proposed a change in our name to harvest natural resources  inc we continue to explore means by which to maximize stockholder value 
on february   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement transaction to sell our entire percent interest in arctic gas company proposed arctic gas sale to a nominee of the yukos oil company  a russian oil and gas company  for million plus approximately million as repayment of inter company loans owed to us by arctic gas 
on march   we were notified that the transaction had received the requisite consents from the russian ministry of antimonopoly and support for entrepreneurship 
on march   we received the first payment million of the proposed arctic gas sale proceeds 
while no assurances can be given  we expect that all aspects of the transaction will be completed by april the net proceeds expected to be realized from the sale  after expenses  taxes  and the settling of certain related claims  is estimated to be approximately million 
these funds will be used  in part  to retire early all of the million of senior notes  which are due in may  in accordance with their terms and without penalty 
we intend to use any remaining net proceeds and cash received from the repayment of loans to further reduce debt from time to time  accelerate our strategic growth in venezuela and russia  and for general corporate purposes 
retirement of all the outstanding notes eliminates million  or per diluted share  of annual interest expense and should mitigate near term concern about the company s liquidity 
these retirements  plus the gain on sale  will allow us to fulfill our previous commitment to restore our balance sheet strength by reducing our debt to capitalization ratio from over to the range see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of management  operational and financial restrictions 
we possess significant producing properties in venezuela  which we believe have yet to be optimized  and valuable unexploited acreage in both venezuela and russia 
we believe the eleven new wells drilled in the south tarasovskoye field since july significantly increase the value of our geoilbent properties 
in december and january  we spudded the first two wells in our seven well tucupita field program in venezuela 
we are evaluating the construction of additional processing and handling facilities and are in discussions with an affiliate of petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa regarding a sales contract that may allow for the first time sale of natural gas in venezuela by our affiliate 
in may  we initiated a process intended to effectively extend the maturity of the senior notes due may  by exchanging new percent senior notes due december plus warrants to purchase shares of our common stock for each of the notes 
the exchange offer was withdrawn in july however  in august  we solicited and received the requisite consents from the holders of both the notes and the notes to amend certain covenants in the indentures governing the notes to enable arctic gas company to incur nonrecourse debt of up to million to fund its oil and gas development program 
as an incentive to consent  we paid each noteholder an amount in cash equal to per  principal amount of notes held for which executed consents were received 
the total amount of consent fees paid to the consenting noteholders was million  which has been included in general and administrative expenses 
in june  we implemented a plan designed to reduce overall general and administrative costs  including exploration overhead  at our corporate headquarters and to transfer management oversight of geological and geophysical activities to our overseas offices in maturin  venezuela and in western siberia and moscow  russia 
the reduction in general and administrative costs was accomplished by reducing our headquarters staff and relocating our headquarters to houston  texas from carpinteria  california 
for  we recorded non recurring items of million  million of which are included in general and administrative expenses  million of which are included in depletion  depreciation and amortization  million in operating expenses and in taxes other than income 
the general and administrative expenses include million on the withdrawn debt exchange  million for severance and termination benefits for employees  million for lease relinquishment expenses and million for relocation costs to houston 
depletion  depreciation and amortization included million for the reduction in the carrying value of fixed assets that were not transferred to houston and million loss on subleasing the former carpinteria headquarters 
all expenses were paid or accrued by december  the accrued balance of million will be paid in operating strategy our business strategy supports the steady investment  prudent risk management and timely harvest of large hydrocarbon resources for attractive values 
for the foreseeable future  we believe our best success will be found in venezuela and russia  areas in which we have significant experience and expertise 
during  our operating strategy was necessarily focused on improving the efficiency and efficacies of our current operations in both venezuela and russia 
over the years  we have benefited from the significant capital commitment made to these areas  but have suffered financially from sub optimal operating  contracting and risk management practices  which  for the most part  have been or are currently in the process of being significantly improved 
in venezuela  we implemented new development and production plans at benton vinccler following an eight month suspension of drilling and an extensive reservoir study  which resulted in increased production  lower operating costs and added confidence in our future drilling plans to extend the life and value of the field 
we have also streamlined decision making  improved internal controls and implemented industry standard techniques to mitigate geologic  operating  financial and political risks attendant with doing business in venezuela 
in russia  where we are a minority owner in geoilbent  we are attempting to pursue a similar course with the help of other interest owners  in order to improve operations and extend the life of the field  lower operating costs and enhance financial results 
these assets represent significant potential value for us  but remain subject to sub optimal operating conditions while our lack of majority control over its operations could inhibit our ability to implement necessary changes in management  operations or financing matters 
in both venezuela and russia  and in other countries around the world  the development of local markets for natural gas represents a significant opportunity for us 
however  the development of these markets  in large part  depends upon substantial capital investment by third parties in the infrastructure needed to produce  gather  treat  transport  store and convert natural gas into marketable products 
while this investment is beginning to materialize in many of these markets  it will take many years  in some instances  to place such assets into service 
we are well positioned to benefit from the emergence of new regional gas markets in proximity to our reserves 
our long term strategy is to identify  access and exploit large resources of hydrocarbons in underexploited areas around the world that can be developed at low overall finding costs  produced at low operating costs and converted into proved reserves  production and value 
while our success is dependent upon many factors both within and outside of our control  in order to achieve this strategy  we must continue to improve our financial flexibility and financing strategies  exploit our core assets in venezuela and russia  and seek and exploit new oil and natural gas resources in our core areas 
we intend to continue to seek and exploit new oil and natural gas reserves in current areas of interest while working toward minimizing the associated financial and operating risks 
to reduce these risks  not only in seeking new reserves  but also with respect to our existing operations  we focus our efforts in areas of low geologic risk we intend to focus our exploration and development activities only in areas of known  proven hydrocarbons 
establish a local presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a local presence in our areas of operation to facilitate stronger relationships with local government and labor 
in addition  using local personnel helps us to take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find local investment partners in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we often agree to minimum capital expenditure or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments so that we can fulfill them over time  thereby limiting our initial cash outlay  as well as maximize the amount of local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
operations the following table summarizes our proved reserves  drilling and production activity  and financial operating data by principal geographic area at and for each of the three years ended december all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and an affiliate of pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
geoilbent and arctic gas company are accounted for under the equity method and have been included at their respective ownership interest in our consolidated financial statements 
our year end financial information contains results from our russian operations based on a twelve month period ending september accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent for the twelve months ended september   and  and from arctic gas for the twelve months ended september  and we own percent of benton vinccler 
the reserve information presented below is net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler

these fields comprise the south monagas unit 
we were the first us company since to be granted such an oil field development contract in venezuela 
the oil and natural gas operations in the south monagas unit are conducted by benton vinccler  our percent owned subsidiary 
the remaining percent of the outstanding capital stock of benton vinccler is owned by vinccler 
through our majority ownership of stock in benton vinccler  we make all operational and corporate decisions related to benton vinccler  subject to certain super majority provisions of benton vinccler s charter documents related to mergers  consolidations  sales of substantially all of its corporate assets  change of business  and similar major corporate events 
vinccler has an extensive operating history in venezuela 
it provided benton vinccler with initial financial assistance and significant construction services 
vinccler continues to provide ongoing assistance with construction projects  governmental and labor relations 
under the terms of the operating service agreement  benton vinccler is a contractor for pdvsa 
benton vinccler is responsible for overall operations of the south monagas unit  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the fields comprising the south monagas unit 
the venezuelan government maintains full ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
in addition  pdvsa maintains full ownership of equipment and capital infrastructure following its installation 
benton vinccler invoices pdvsa each quarter based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted contract service fees per barrel 
benton vinccler receives its payments from pdvsa in us dollars deposited directly into a us bank account 
the operating service agreement provides for benton vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides benton vinccler with the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
the operating fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the special energy index of the us consumer price index 
the maximum total fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the average of certain world crude oil prices 
in december  benton vinccler entered into an alliance with schlumberger for the uracoa field which includes reservoir modeling  drilling and downhole electrical pumping 
the alliance gives us access to schlumberger s technical resources and personnel and provides financial incentives for schlumberger based on their performance 
the incentives are designed to reduce drilling costs  improve initial production rates of new wells and increase the average life of downhole pumps 
schlumberger maintains a full time staff at benton vinccler s office as part of this agreement 
we signed an amendment to the alliance in whereby schlumberger agreed to provide drilling and completion services for new wells utilizing fixed lump sum pricing 
the amended alliance continues to provide incentives to schlumberger designed to improve initial production rates of new wells and to increase the average life of the downhole pumps 
we drilled eight oil wells in as part of our strategic shift in focus on the value of the barrels produced  we suspended the development drilling program for a period of approximately eight months starting in january during this period  with the assistance of alliance partner schlumberger  all aspects of operations were thoroughly reviewed to integrate field performance to date with revised computer simulation modeling and improved well completion technology 
we believe this helped to produce a streamlined and more effective infill drilling and well workover program that is part of an overall reservoir management strategy 
location and geology the south monagas unit extends across the southeastern part of the state of monagas and the southwestern part of the state of delta amacuro in eastern venezuela 
the south monagas unit is approximately miles long and eight miles wide and consists of  acres  of which the fields comprise approximately one half 
at december   proved reserves attributable to our venezuelan operations were  mbbls  mbbls net to benton 
this represented approximately percent of our proved reserves 
benton vinccler has been primarily developing the oficina sands in the uracoa field 
the uracoa field contains percent of the south monagas unit s proved reserves 
in december  benton vinccler began the development of the tucupita field 
we intend to drill seven oil wells and two water injection wells in the tucupita field during benton vinccler is currently reinjecting most of the associated natural gas produced at uracoa back into the reservoir 
natural gas sale negotiations we are currently in discussions with pdvsa regarding the negotiation of a contract contemplating the sale of natural gas produced from the south monagas unit 
benton vinccler anticipates natural gas from the uracoa and bombal fields could be dedicated to pdvsa over the remaining life of the operating service agreement 
if the parties reach an agreement  construction of a pipeline  compressor and other necessary infrastructure may be required in order to deliver natural gas to pdvsa in accordance with agreed specifications 
however  there are no assurances that a natural gas contract will result from these negotiations 
drilling and development activity benton vinccler drilled wells and had an average of wells on production in all fields in uracoa field benton vinccler has been developing the south monagas unit since  beginning with the uracoa field 
the following table sets forth the uracoa field drilling activity and production information for each of the quarters presented wells drilled average daily vertical horizontal production from field bbls first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  in  we developed a geologic and reservoir simulation study which indicated the viability of multiple additional primary infill wells in the uracoa field 
we believe many of these new locations are in underdeveloped sands where the model may help to optimize well spacing and location 
in the more developed areas of the field  we used the model to verify our economic assumptions regarding infill locations 
in the first quarter of  we began a comprehensive technical review of the south monagas unit that includes the completion of an extensive geologic and reservoir computer simulation study which we believe will assist in optimizing field management 
the computer simulation study  built jointly with schlumberger  may update and extend the study performed on a portion of the uracoa field to the entire south monagas unit 
it will incorporate all new geologic and reservoir information as well as the total production and drilling history from the more mature uracoa field and the underdeveloped tucupita and bombal fields 
we expect several benefits from the study including an optimum production profile of oil and gas  a revised water and natural gas injection strategy  more efficient development locations and improved well completion techniques 
we anticipate completing a revised uracoa field development plan  incorporating the results of this study  in mid since  we have reactivated previously drilled wells and drilled new wells in the uracoa field using improved drilling and completion techniques that had not previously been utilized on the field 
of the new wells drilled  wells were drilled as water or natural gas injector wells and an additional producing wells have been converted into injection wells 
two of the drilled injector wells were subsequently converted into producing wells 
we process the oil  water and natural gas produced from the uracoa field in the uracoa central processing unit 
we ship the processed oil via pipeline to the pdvsa custody transfer point 
we treat and filter produced water  and then re inject it into the aquifer to assist the natural water drive 
we re inject natural gas into the natural gas cap primarily for storage conservation 
the major components of the state of the art process facility were designed in the united states and installed by benton vinccler 
this process design is commonly used in heavy oil production in the united states  but was not previously used extensively in venezuela to process crude oil of similar gravity or quality 
the current production facility has capacity to handle mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day  and mcf of natural gas per day 
in august  benton vinccler sold its power generation facility located in the uracoa field for million 
concurrently with the sale  benton vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreement with the purchaser of the facility to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
tucupita and bombal fields before becoming inactive in  the tucupita field had been substantially developed 
it had produced mmbbls of oil  mmbbls of water and bcf of natural gas 
benton vinccler drilled a successful pilot horizontal well in late to evaluate the remaining development potential of the tucupita field 
this well has produced mmbbls of oil at an average rate of bbls of oil per day 
the early success of this pilot horizontal well led to the drilling of a second horizontal well in initial oil rates from the horizontal wells were encouraging  but water production soon increased sharply 
as a result  we changed the redevelopment strategy to include drilling deviated wells to allow for more effective water shut off 
during the second half of  we drilled five deviated infill wells to target undepleted portions of the field and reactivated an additional nine wells 
all five drilled wells encountered high oil saturations  with an average initial production rate of bbls of oil per day 
in  we reactivated nine wells in tucupita and identified seven new well locations in what we believe are undepleted portions of the tucupita field  which we anticipate drilling in as a result of our analysis of the potential in the tucupita field  and for environmental and safety reasons  we constructed a million  mile   bbl per day capacity oil pipeline from tucupita to the uracoa central processing unit in we are reinjecting produced water from tucupita into the aquifer to aid the natural water drive  and we utilize a portion of the associated natural gas to operate a power generation facility 
to date  we have drilled one well in the bombal field and reactivated another 
the bombal field is now shut in 
we are currently evaluating the future development plan for bombal in light of our negotiations with pdvsa concerning the sale of natural gas 
customers and market information oil produced in venezuela is delivered to pdvsa under the terms of an operating service agreement for an operating service fee 
benton vinccler has constructed a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility 
this is the custody transfer point 
the service agreement specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than one percent base sediment and water 
quality measurements are conducted both at benton vinccler s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
we installed a continuous flow measuring unit at our facility to closely monitor the quantities of hydrocarbons delivered to pdvsa 
this flow measuring unit was completed in january pdvsa provides benton vinccler with a daily acknowledgment regarding the amount of oil accepted during the previous day 
at the end of each quarter  benton vinccler prepares an invoice to pdvsa for that quarter s deliveries 
pdvsa pays the invoice by the end of the second month after the end of the quarter 
invoice amounts and payments are denominated in us dollars 
payments are wire transferred into benton vinccler s account in a commercial bank in the united states 
natural gas produced by benton vinccler is currently re injected or used as fuel gas in operations 
we are currently in negotiations with pdvsa for sale of natural gas in the south monagas unit 
there are no assurances that natural gas contracts will result from these negotiations 
employees and community relations benton vinccler has a highly skilled staff of predominately venezuelan nationals 
benton vinccler has also formed successful and supportive relationships with local government agencies and communities 
there are local employees and expatriates working at benton vinccler 
benton vinccler has invested in a social community program that includes medical care programs such as in ophthalmologic and dental care 
from to  a total of eye surgeries were performed on patients ranging in age from two to eighty five years  solely as a result of financial assistance provided by benton vinccler 
the dental program focuses on comprehensive dental care for public school children 
from to  the program has involved approximately  children 
additional social investments include sponsoring the purchase of medicines and medical equipment in local communities within the south monagas unit  as well as supporting local schools  education programs and environmental improvements 
health  safety and environment benton vinccler s health  safety and environmental policy is an integral part of its business 
annually  improvements have been made in operating performance  personnel safety  property protection and environmental management 
these improvements can be directly attributed to the efforts in accident prevention programs and the training and implementation of a comprehensive process safety management system 
north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye  russia geoilbent general in december  the joint venture agreement forming geoilbent was registered with the ministry of finance of the ussr 
geoilbent s ownership is as follows benton owns percent  open joint stock company minley minley owns percent 
in november  the agreement was registered with the russian agency for international cooperation and development 
geoilbent was later re chartered as a limited liability company 
we believe that we have developed a good relationship with our shareholder and have not experienced any disagreements on major operational matters 
purneftegazgeologia and purneftegas co founding shareholders contributed their interest to minley in we are reviewing ways to improve the operations  but we are a minority partner and therefore may not be able to fully effect changes in operations  if indicated by our review 
geoilbent shareholder action requires a percent majority vote of its shareholders 
location and geology geoilbent develops  produces and markets crude oil from the north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye fields in the west siberia region of russia  located approximately  miles northeast of moscow 
large proven oil and gas fields surround all four of geoilbent s licenses 
the north gubinskoye field is included inside a license block of  acres  an area approximately miles long and four miles wide 
the field has been delineated with over exploratory wells  which tested separate reservoirs 
the field is a large anticlinal structure with multiple pay sands 
the development to date has focused on the bp    and reservoirs with minor development in the bp and reservoirs 
geoilbent is currently flaring the produced natural gas in accordance with environmental regulations  although it is exploring alternatives to market the natural gas 
the south tarasovskoye field is located a few miles southeast of north gubinskoye field and straddles the eastern boundary of the urabor yakhinsky exploration block acquired by geoilbent in it is estimated a majority of the field is situated within the block 
the remaining portion of the field falls within a license block owned by purneftegaz 
production began in early from a discovery well drilled close to the boundary by purneftegaz 
only of geoilbent s  acres in this field are reflected as proved developed acres 
geoilbent also holds rights to two more license blocks comprising  acres in the west siberia region of russia 
drilling and development activity geoilbent commenced initial operations in the north gubinskoye field during the third quarter of with the construction of a mile oil pipeline and installation of temporary production facilities 
during  approximately wells were producing with injection wells 
drilling in south tarasovskoye field began at the end of may the first well was completed on july  for an initial production rate of  bbls oil per day 
in  geoilbent drilled wells at an average production rate of bbls oil per day 
by the end of  total production from the wells was  bbls oil per day 
plans are to drill between to more wells by to more fully develop the portion of the field within the urabor block 
the following table sets forth drilling activity and production information for each of the quarters presented average daily wells drilled production from field bbls first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  geoilbent contracts with third parties for drilling and completion of wells 
to date  previously drilled wells have been reactivated and wells have been drilled in the field 
a total of wells  or percent  have been completed and placed on production  of which were converted to water injection wells 
each well is drilled to an average measured depth of approximately  feet and an average true vertical depth of  feet 
the current production facilities are operating at or near capacity and will need to be expanded to accommodate production increases 
geoilbent transports oil produced from the north gubkinskoye field to production facilities constructed and owned by geoilbent 
it then transfers the oil to geoilbent s mile pipeline  which transports the oil from the north gubkinskoye field south to the main russian oil pipeline network 
geoilbent has obtained financing through a million parallel loan facility for the development of the north gubkinskoye field from the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and the international moscow bank 
a total of million had been advanced from the loan facility 
debt outstanding under the facility at december  was million 
as of september   geoilbent was not in compliance with the current ratio covenant but received a waiver from ebrd through march  geoilbent has reduced its capital budget to approximately million  of which million is for the north gubkinskoye field  million is for the south tarakovskoye field  million is to carry out seismic and related exploration activity and million is for natural gas plant economic  technical and feasibility studies 
geoilbent s operating budget includes million for principal payments on the loan facility 
in addition  geoilbent had outstanding accounts payable of million as of december   primarily to contractors and vendors for drilling and construction services 
although geoilbent s reduced capital expenditure budget may help to alleviate any shortfall of funds available to make payments to the banks and its creditors as those payments come due  it is uncertain that geoilbent s cash flow from operations will be sufficient to do so  and it may be necessary for geoilbent to obtain capital contributions from its partners  including the company  to have sufficient funds to make these payments on a timely basis 
although the company may consider making such a capital contribution  there can be no assurances that the company will do so  nor can there be any assurances that geoilbent s other partner will be willing or able to do so 
under russian law  a creditor can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy if the company s payments have been due for more than days 
customers and market information geoilbent s mile pipeline runs from the field to the main pipeline in the area where geoilbent transfers the oil to transneft  the state oil pipeline monopoly 
transneft then transports the oil to the western border of russia for export sales or to various domestic locations for non export sales 
trading companies such as rosneftegasexport handle all export oil sales 
all export sales have been paid in us dollars into geoilbent s account in moscow 
domestic sales are paid in russian rubles 
during  geoilbent sold approximately percent of its production in the export market and percent in the domestic market 
excise  pipeline and other tariffs and taxes continue to be levied on all oil producers and certain exporters  including an oil export tariff that decreased in to per ton approximately per barrel from euros per ton approximately per barrel 
we are unable to predict the impact of taxes  duties and other burdens for the future for our russian operations 
employees  community and country relations geoilbent employs russian nationals almost exclusively 
presently  there are two full time expatriates working with geoilbent and local employees 
we have conducted community relations programs  providing medical care  training  equipment and supplies in towns in which geoilbent personnel reside and also for the nomadic indigenous population which reside in the area of oilfield operations 
east urengoy  russia arctic gas company general see the proposed sale of arctic gas company  if closed  will reduce the impact of leverage in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the audited financial statements in item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
arctic gas company  formerly severneftegaz  was formed in as a private company to explore and develop the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks 
the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks are located within the west siberian basin  the world s largest sedimentary basin  which contains a significant portion of the world s natural gas reserves 
both license blocks are on the eastern flank of the giant urengoy natural gas field  which currently produces hydrocarbons from cenomanian reservoirs 
under the terms of agreements signed in april  we acquired a percent interest in arctic gas in return for providing or arranging up to million of credit financing for the project 
our agreements impose restrictions on the sale and transfer of these shares subject to disbursements under the credit financing and provide that for every million of credit made available  percent of the interest will be released from the restrictions 
as of december   we had provided million of credit  of which million had been applied to the release of restrictions on the shares 
as a result  we removed restrictions from shares representing an approximate percent equity interest 
from through december  we separately purchased shares representing an additional percent equity interest not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions 
including the additional purchased shares  as of december   we owned a total of percent of the voting shares of arctic gas  of which percent was not subject to restrictions 
the following table summarizes our ownership interests of arctic gas company as of december  shares released from restrictions additional purchased shares total shares not subject to restrictions shares subject to restrictions total ownership in february  we announced the proposed arctic gas sale 
on march   we were notified that the transaction had received the requisite consents from the russian ministry for antimonopoly policy and support for entrepreneurship 
on march   we received the first payment million of the proposed arctic gas sale proceeds 
location and geology the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks comprise  acres and are situated approximately miles north of our geoilbent affiliates operations in the yamal nenets autonomous region of russia 
the towns and communities of novy urengoy  samburg  urengoy and nyda are located near the two licenses 
extensive exploration drilling and testing over wells on the samburg and yevo yakha licenses has resulted in the discovery of major resources of natural gas  condensate and oil 
the primary reservoirs of these fields are currently being produced in both the adjacent urengoy field and rospan block 
drilling and development activity arctic gas has reactivated previously drilled oil wells through march  we are trucking oil to storage facilities where it is collected for sale 
arctic gas is currently producing approximately  bbls of oil per day 
the following table sets forth reactivation activity and production information for each of the quarters presented wells average daily reactivated production from field bbls first quarter second quarter third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  arctic gas is currently planning for a samburg oil and natural gas pilot development project 
the pilot project calls for drilling new wells  installing natural gas processing facilities  and connecting into the export pipeline system 
the arctic gas blocks are located in the heart of the urengoy yamburg producing and support infrastructure region and are well situated for development 
natural gas export trunklines are located kilometers from the blocks 
arctic gas and gazprom have entered into agreements to allow access to existing oil  liquids and natural gas pipelines and facilities that could potentially result in product sales to domestic and export markets 
see note to the audited financial statements in item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
arctic gas had entered into contracts with various parties concerning the export of natural gas 
all natural gas contracts have been cancelled pursuant to the proposed arctic gas sale 
further development activities are subject to the pace and scope of arctic gas s internally generated funds and to our ability to provide or arrange further funding 
employees  community and country relations arctic gas is a russian company that employs russian nationals almost exclusively 
presently  there are full time expatriates working with arctic gas and local employees 
we have conducted community relations programs in russia  providing medical care  training  equipment and supplies in towns in which arctic gas personnel reside and also for the nomadic indigenous population which reside in the area of oilfield operations 
wab  south china sea benton offshore china company general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  a privately held company headquartered in denver  colorado  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with conoco inc the dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
we cannot predict how or when  if at all  this dispute will be resolved or whether it would result in our interest being reduced 
location and geology the wab contract area is located approximately miles southeast of the dai hung big bear oil field 
the block is adjacent to british petroleum s giant natural gas discovery at lan tay red orchid and miles north of exxon s natuna discovery 
the contract area covers several similar structural trends  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones 
drilling and development activity due to the sovereignty issues  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained extensions  with the current extension in effect until may  domestic operations in april and may  we entered into agreements with coastline energy corporation coastline for the purpose of acquiring  exploring and developing oil and natural gas prospects both onshore and in the state waters of the gulf coast states of texas  louisiana and mississippi 
we acquired a percent working interest in the lakeside exploration prospect in cameron parish  louisiana 
we farmed out percent of the working interest in the prospect for million cash and a percent carried interest in the first well 
we anticipate that drilling of the well may commence in the agreement with coastline was terminated on august  however  certain ongoing operations related to the lakeside exploration prospect are conducted by coastline on a consulting basis 
in march  we acquired a percent participation interest in three california state offshore oil and natural gas leases california leases from molino energy company  llc molino energy  which held percent of these leases 
the project area covers the molino  gaviota and caliente fields  located approximately miles west of santa barbara  california 
in consideration of the percent participation interest in the california leases  we became the operator of the project and agreed to pay percent of the first million and percent of the remainder of the costs of the first well drilled on the block 
during  the exploratory well was drilled to the gaviota anticline 
drill stem tests proved to be inconclusive or non commercial  and the well was temporarily abandoned for further evaluation 
in november  we entered into an agreement to acquire molino energy s interest in the california leases in exchange for the release of their joint interest billing obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to focus our capital expenditures on existing producing properties and fulfilling work commitments associated with our other properties 
because we had no firm approved plans to continue drilling on the california leases and the exploratory well did not result in commercial reserves  we wrote off all of the capitalized costs associated with the california leases of million and the joint interest receivable of million due from molino energy at december  however  we continue to evaluate the prospect for potential future drilling activities

in prior years  reserve estimates were prepared by us and audited by huddleston co  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
the following table sets forth information regarding estimates of proved reserves at december  the venezuelan information includes reserve information net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler 
all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
although we estimate that there are substantial natural gas reserves in the benton vinccler properties in venezuela and the license blocks held by geoilbent  no natural gas reserves have been recorded as of december  because of a lack of sales and or transportation contracts in place 
geoilbent and benton vinccler are currently evaluating alternatives to market this natural gas 
natural gas proved reserves have been recognized for arctic gas  which has transportation and marketing contracts in place 
the marketing contracts were cancelled in anticipation of the proposed arctic gas sale 
see note to the audited financial statements in item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
the cancellation will have an impact on the equity affiliate russia reserves found on table iv quantities of oil and natural gas reserves 
net crude oil and condensate mbbls proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela    geoilbent    arctic gas    total    net natural gas mmcf proved proved developed undeveloped total arctic gas    based on percent ownership not subject to restrictions as of december  estimates of commercially recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of the future net cash flows derived therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the subject properties  comparison with other producing properties  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  export tariffs  abandonment costs  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are to some degree speculative  and various classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved 
for these reasons  estimates of the commercially recoverable reserves of oil attributable to any particular property or group of properties  the classification  cost and risk of recovering such reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
the difficulty of making precise estimates is accentuated by the fact that percent of our total proved reserves were undeveloped as of december  therefore  the following costs will likely vary from our estimates and such variances may be material actual production  oil sales  severance and excise taxes  export tariffs  development expenditures  workover and remedial expenditures  abandonment expenditures  and operating expenditures 
reserve estimates are not constrained by the availability of the capital resources required to finance the estimated development and operating expenditures 
in addition  actual future net cash flows will be affected by factors such as actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  availability and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines  changes in governmental regulations or taxation  and the impact of inflation on costs 
the timing of actual future net oil sales and natural gas from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value  can be affected by the timing of the incurrence of expenditures in connection with development of oil and gas properties 
the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate present value for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry 
discounted present value  no matter what discount rate is used  is materially affected by assumptions as to the amount and timing of future production  which assumptions may and often do prove to be inaccurate 
for the period ending december   we reported million of discounted future net cash flows before income taxes from proved reserves based on the sec s required calculations 
production  prices and lifting cost summary in the following table we have set forth by country our net production  average sales prices and average lifting costs for the years ended december   and the presentation for venezuela includes percent of the production  without deduction for minority interest 
geoilbent percent ownership and arctic gas percent  percent and percent ownership not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions at december  and  respectively  which are accounted for under the equity method  have been included at their respective ownership interest in the consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal period ending september and  accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent for the twelve months ended september   and  and from arctic gas for the twelve months ended september  and years ended december  venezuela net crude oil production bbls    average crude oil sales price per bbl average lifting costs per bbl geoilbent average crude oil production bbls    average crude oil sales price per bbl average lifting costs per bbl arctic gas net crude oil production bbls   average crude oil sales price per bbl average lifting costs per bbl regulation general our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by change in governments  price and currency controls  limitations on oil and natural gas production  world demand for crude oil  tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in such laws  and changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations 
in addition  various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and costs 
in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation is periodically changed for a variety of political  economic  environmental and other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business 
venezuela venezuela requires environmental and other permits for certain operations conducted in oil field development  such as site construction  drilling  and seismic activities 
as a contractor to pdvsa  benton vinccler submits capital and operating budgets to pdvsa for approval 
capital expenditures to comply with venezuelan environmental regulations relating to the reinjection of natural gas in the field and water disposal were million in and million in benton vinccler also submits requests for permits for drilling  seismic and operating activities to pdvsa  which then obtains such permits from the ministry of energy and mines and ministry of environment  as required 
benton vinccler is also subject to income  municipal and value added taxes  and must file certain monthly and annual compliance reports to the national tax administration and to various municipalities 
russia geoilbent and arctic gas submit annual production and development plans  which include information necessary for permits and approvals for their planned drilling  seismic and operating activities  to local and regional governments and to the ministry of fuel and energy and the ministry of natural resources 
they also submit annual production targets and quarterly export nominations for oil pipeline transportation capacity to the ministry of fuel and energy 
geoilbent and arctic gas are subject to customs  value added  and municipal and income taxes 
various municipalities and regional tax inspectorates are involved in the assessment and collection of these taxes 
geoilbent and arctic gas must file operating and financial compliance reports with several agencies  including the ministry of fuel and energy  ministry of natural resources  committee for technical mining monitoring and the state customs committee 
russian companies are subject to a statutory income tax rate of up to percent and are subject to various other tax burdens and tariffs 
excise  pipeline and other tariffs and taxes continue to be levied on all oil producers and certain exporters  including an oil export tariff that decreased to per ton approximately per barrel from euros per ton approximately per barrel 
we are unable to predict the impact of taxes  duties and other burdens in the future for our russian operations 
drilling  acquisition and finding costs from commencement of operations through december   we added  net of production and property sales  approximately mmboe of proved reserves through purchases of reserves in place  discoveries of oil and natural gas reserves  extensions of existing producing fields and revisions of previously estimated reserves  for which the finding costs were per boe 
our estimate of future development costs for our undeveloped proved reserves at december  was per boe 
the estimated future development costs are based upon our anticipated cost of developing our non producing proved reserves  which costs are calculated using historical costs for similar activities

all of our drilling activities are conducted on a contract basis with independent drilling contractors 
we do not directly own or operate any drilling equipment

competition we encounter strong competition from major oil and gas companies and independent operators in acquiring properties and leases for exploration for crude oil and natural gas 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and gas properties include the staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such leases  and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases 
many of our competitors have financial resources  staffs and facilities substantially greater than ours 
environmental regulation we are subject to environmental regulations administered by foreign governments  their agencies  or other international organizations 
we are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 
however  regulatory requirements change and become more stringent  and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
employees at december   we had full time employees  augmented from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
benton vinccler had employees  geoilbent had employees and arctic gas had employees 
title to developed and undeveloped acreage all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
with regard to russian acreage  geoilbent and arctic gas have obtained certain documentation from appropriate regulatory agencies in russia which we believe is adequate to establish their right to develop  produce and market oil and natural gas from their fields 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for another million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with conoco inc the territorial dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution  although certain proposed economic solutions currently under discussion would result in our interest being reduced 
as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we make a limited review of title to farm out acreage and to undeveloped us oil and natural gas leases upon execution of the contracts and leases 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations  a thorough drillsite title examination is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects 
we follow the practice of obtaining title opinions on our domestic producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens for current taxes  and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties

exploratory well 
an exploratory well is a well drilled in search of a new and as yet undiscovered pool of oil or natural gas  or to extend the known limits of a field under development 
finding cost 
finding cost  expressed in dollars per boe  is calculated by dividing the amount of total capital expenditures related to acquisitions  exploration and development costs reduced by proceeds for any sale of oil and gas properties by the amount of total net reserves added or reduced as a result of property acquisitions and sales  drilling activities and reserve revisions during the same period 
future development cost 
future development cost of proved nonproducing reserves  expressed in dollars per boe  is calculated by dividing the amount of future capital expenditures related to development properties by the amount of total proved non producing reserves associated with such activities 
gross acres or wells 
gross acres or wells are the total acres or wells  as the case may be  in which an entity has an interest  either directly or through an affiliate 
lifting costs 
lifting costs are the expenses of lifting oil from a producing formation to the surface  consisting of the costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities  including labor costs  repair and maintenance  supplies  insurance  production  severance and windfall profit taxes 
net acres or wells 
a party s net acres or net wells are calculated by multiplying the number of gross acres of gross wells in which that party has an interest by the fractional interest of the party in each such acre or well 
producing properties or reserves 
producing reserves are proved developed reserves expected to be produced from existing completion intervals now open for production in existing wells 
producing properties are properties to which producing reserves have been assigned by an independent petroleum engineer 
proved developed reserves 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and natural gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  that is  on the basis of prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made and any price changes provided for by existing conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves 
reserves means crude oil and natural gas  condensate and natural gas liquids  which are net of leasehold burdens  are stated on a net revenue interest basis  and are found to be commercially recoverable 
royalty interest 
a royalty interest is an interest in an oil and gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production or the proceeds of the sale thereof free of the costs of production 
standardized measure of future net cash flows 
the standardized measure of future net cash flows is a method of determining the present value of proved reserves 
the future net oil sales from proved reserves are estimated assuming that oil and natural gas prices and production costs remain constant 
the resulting stream of oil sales is then discounted at the rate of percent per year to obtain a present value 
undeveloped acreage 
undeveloped acreage is oil and natural gas acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit commercial production regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves

item legal proceedings on february   the wrt creditors liquidation trust wrt trust filed suit in the united states bankruptcy court  western district of louisiana against us and benton oil and gas company of louisiana  aka ventures oil gas of louisiana bogla  seeking a determination that the sale by bogla to tesla resources corporation tesla  a wholly owned subsidiary of wrt energy corporation  of certain west cote blanche bay properties for million  constituted a fraudulent conveyance under usc sections  and the bankruptcy code 
the alleged basis of the claim is that tesla was insolvent at the time of its acquisition of the properties  and that it paid a price in excess of the fair value of the property 
a trial commenced on may  that concluded at the end of august  and post trial briefs were filed 
in august  a favorable decision was rendered in bogla s favor denying any and all relief to the wrt trust 
the wrt trust has filed a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy court  however  we believe that the appeal will result in an outcome consistent with the court s prior decision 
from through  we made unsecured loans to our then chief executive officer  ae benton  bearing interest at the rate of percent per annum 
we subsequently obtained a security interest in mr 
benton s shares of stock and stock options 
in august  mr 
benton filed a chapter reorganization bankruptcy petition in the us bankruptcy court for the central district of california  in santa barbara  california 
in february  we entered into a separation agreement and a consulting agreement with mr 
benton pursuant to which we retained mr 
benton as an independent contractor to perform certain services for us 
during  we paid mr 
benton  and have paid a total of  from february through may  for services performed under the consulting agreement

benton and the company entered into a settlement and release agreement under which the consulting agreement was terminated and mr 
benton agreed to propose a plan of reorganization in his bankruptcy case that provides for the repayment of our loans to him 
we currently continue to retain our security interest in mr 
benton s  shares of our stock and in his stock options  and we have the right to vote the shares owned by him and to direct the exercise of his options 
repayment of our loans to mr 
benton may be achieved through mr 
benton s liquidation of certain real and personal property assets and a phased liquidation of stock resulting in mr 
benton s exercise of his stock options 
the amount that we eventually realize  and the timing of receipt of payments will depend upon the timing and results of the liquidation of mr 
benton s assets 
the amount of mr 
benton s indebtedness to us is currently approximately million 
the consulting agreement provides that if we close the proposed arctic gas sale  mr 
benton will be entitled to receive two percent of our net after tax cash receipts  actually received by us in the us  resulting from the proposed arctic gas sale  excluding any repayment of indebtedness or advances by us to arctic gas 
the consulting agreement further provides that under his proposed bankruptcy plan of reorganization  mr 
benton will pay five percent of such amounts to us 
based upon information provided by mr 
benton s bankruptcy counsel  we anticipate that under the bankruptcy plan of reorganization that mr 
benton will propose  we will receive million 
this amount does not include the amounts that we will realize from the exercise of mr 
benton s options and the subsequent sale of the resulting shares  nor does it include the net proceeds that we will receive from the sale of mr

on february   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement proposed arctic gas sale to sell our entire percent stock ownership interest in arctic gas company to a nominee of the yukos oil company for million 
we will also receive approximately million as repayment of intercompany loans owed to us by arctic gas 
we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to retire all of the million outstanding percent senior notes in accordance with their terms 
we intend to use any remaining net proceeds and cash received from the repayment of loans to further reduce debt from time to time  accelerate the strategic growth of its assets in venezuela and russia and for general corporate purposes 
on march   we were notified that the transaction had received the requisite consents from the russian ministry for antimonopoly policy and support for entrepreneurship 
on march   we received the first payment million of the proposed arctic gas sale proceeds 
however  in the event that the transaction does not close  we will be required to review additional strategic alternatives to repay the million of percent senior notes due in may  including  but not limited to  selling all or part of our existing assets in venezuela and russia  restructuring our debt  some combination thereof  or the selling of the company 
however  no assurance can be given that any of these steps can be successfully completed or that we ultimately will determine that any of the steps should be taken

in the event that the proposed arctic gas sale does not close  we will request arctic gas to immediately repay this facility 
we possess significant producing properties in venezuela  which we believe have yet to be optimized  and valuable unexploited acreage in both venezuela and russia 
we believe the eleven new wells drilled in the south tarasovskoye field since july may significantly increase the value of our geoilbent properties 
in december and january  we spudded the first two wells in our seven well tucupita field program in venezuela 
we are evaluating the construction of additional processing and handling facilities and are in discussions with pdvsa to negotiate a sales contract that will allow for the first time sale of natural gas in venezuela by our affiliate 
in may  we initiated a process intended to effectively extend the maturity of the senior notes due may  by exchanging new percent senior notes due december plus warrants to purchase shares of our common stock for each of the notes 
the exchange offer was withdrawn in july however  in august  we solicited and received the requisite consents from the holders of both the notes and the notes to amend certain covenants in the indentures governing the notes to enable arctic gas company to incur nonrecourse debt of up to million to fund its oil and gas development program 
as an incentive to consent  we paid each noteholder an amount in cash equal to per  principal amount of notes held for which executed consents were received 
the total amount of consent fees paid to the consenting noteholders was million  which has been included in general and administrative expenses 
in june  we implemented a plan designed to reduce overall general and administrative costs  including exploration overhead  at our corporate headquarters and to transfer management oversight of geological and geophysical activities to our overseas offices in maturin  venezuela and in western siberia and moscow  russia 
the reduction in general and administrative costs was accomplished by reducing our headquarters staff and relocating our headquarters to houston  texas from carpinteria  california 
for  we recorded non recurring items of million  million of which are included in general and administrative expenses  million of which are included in depletion  depreciation and amortization  million in operating expenses and million in taxes other than income 
the general and administrative expenses include million on the failed debt exchange  million for severance and termination benefits for employees  million for lease relinquishment expenses  and million for relocation costs to houston 
depletion  depreciation and amortization included million for the reduction in the carrying value of fixed assets that were not transferred to houston and million loss on subleasing the former carpinteria headquarters 
all expenses were paid by december  geoilbent has reduced its capital budget to approximately million  of which million is for the north gubkinskoye field  million is for the south tarakovskoye field  million is to carry out seismic and related exploration activity and million is for natural gas plant economic  technical and feasibility studies 
geoilbent s operating budget includes million for principal payments on the loan facility 
in addition  geoilbent had outstanding accounts payable of million as of december   primarily to contractors and vendors for drilling and construction services 
although geoilbent s reduced capital expenditure budget may help to alleviate any shortfall of funds available to make payments to the banks and its creditors as those payments come due  it is uncertain that geoilbent s cash flow from operations will be sufficient to do so  and it may be necessary for geoilbent to obtain capital contributions from its partners  including the company  to have sufficient funds to make these payments on a timely basis 
although the company may consider making such a capital contribution  there can be no assurances that the company will do so  nor can there be any assurances that geoilbent s other partner will be willing or able to do so 
under russian law  a creditor can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy if the company s payments have been due for more than days 
at the annual meeting of our shareholders to be held on may   our stockholders will vote on a proposal to change the name of our company to harvest natural resources  inc operating strategy our business strategy supports the steady investment  prudent risk management and timely harvest of large hydrocarbon resources for attractive values 
for the foreseeable future  we believe our best success will be found in venezuela and russia  areas in which we have significant experience and expertise 
during  our operating strategy was necessarily focused on improving the efficiency and efficacies of our current operations in both venezuela and russia 
over the years  we have benefited from the significant capital commitment made to these areas  but have suffered financially from sub optimal operating  contracting and risk management practices which  for the most part  have been or are currently in the process of being significantly improved 
in venezuela  we implemented new development and production plans at benton vinccler following an eight month suspension of drilling and an extensive reservoir study  which resulted in increased production  lower operating costs  and added confidence in our future drilling plans to extend the life and value of the field 
we have also streamlined decision making  improved internal controls and implemented industry standard techniques to mitigate geologic  operating  financial and political risks attendant with doing business in venezuela 
in russia  where we are a minority holder in geoilbent  we are attempting to pursue a similar course  with the help of other interest owners  in order to improve operations and extend the life of the field  lower operating costs and enhance financial results 
these assets represent significant potential value for us  but remain subject to sub optimal operating conditions while our lack of majority control over its operations could inhibit our ability to implement necessary changes in management  operations or financing matters 
in both venezuela and russia  and in other counties around the world  the development of local markets for natural gas represents a significant opportunity for us 
however  the development of these markets  in large part  depends upon substantial capital investment by third parties in the infrastructure needed to produce  gather  treat  transport  store and convert natural gas into marketable products 
while this investment is beginning to materialize in many of these markets  it will take many years  in some instances  to place such assets into service 
we are well positioned to benefit from the emergence of new regional gas markets in proximity to our reserves 
our long term strategy is to identify  access and exploit large resources of hydrocarbons in underexploited areas around the world that can be developed at low overall finding costs  produced at low operating costs and converted into proved reserves  production and value 
while our success is dependent upon many factors both within and outside of our control  in order to achieve this strategy  we must continue to improve our financial flexibility and financing strategies  exploit our core assets in venezuela and russia  and seek and exploit new oil and natural gas resources in our core areas 
we intend to continue to seek and exploit new oil and natural gas reserves in current areas of interest while working toward minimizing the associated financial and operating risks 
to reduce these risks  not only in seeking new reserves  but also with respect to our existing operations  we focus our efforts in areas of low geologic risk we intend to focus our exploration and development activities only in areas of known  proven hydrocarbons 
establish a local presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a local presence in our areas of operation to facilitate stronger relationships with local government and labor 
in addition  using local personnel helps us to take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find local investment partners in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we often agree to minimum capital expenditure or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments so that we can fulfill them over time  thereby limiting our initial cash outlay  as well as maximize the amount of local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
results of operations we include the results of operations of benton vinccler in our consolidated financial statements and reflect the percent ownership interest of vinccler as a minority interest 
we account for our investments in geoilbent and arctic gas using the equity method 
we include geoilbent and arctic gas in our consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal year ending september our results of operations reflect the results of geoilbent and arctic gas for the twelve months ended september   and you should read the following discussion of the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition as of december  and in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have presented selected expense items from our consolidated income statement as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales in the following table years ended december  operating expenses depletion  depreciation and amortization general and administrative taxes other than on income interest non recurring costs excluded in millions in natural gas fuel use charges for the period of through before venezuelan tax and minority interest is included 
reduction in carrying value of california office lease 
in debt exchange costs  california office lease relinquishment  relocation to houston  severance and termination payments 
in municipal tax adjustments before venezuelan tax and minority interest 
years ended december  and our results of operations for the year ended december  primarily reflected the reversal of our tax valuation allowance and results for benton vinccler  ca in venezuela  which accounted for all of our production and oil sales revenue 
as a result of decreases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by higher production from the south monagas unit  oil sales in venezuela were percent lower in compared with realized fees per barrel decreased percent from in to in and oil sales quantities increased percent from mmbbls of oil in to mmbbls of oil in 
our operating expenses from the south monagas unit decreased by percent due to decreased workover costs and completion of the mile oil pipeline in the fourth quarter of to transport oil from the tucupita field to the central processing unit in the uracoa field 
our revenues decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to decreased oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of decreases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by higher sales quantities 
our sales quantities for the year ended december  from venezuela were mmbbls compared to mmbbls for the year ended december  the increase in sales quantities of  bbls  or percent  was due primarily to production efficiency and reservoir management at uracoa  and enhanced drilling performance for the eight wells drilled in the uracoa field beginning august  as a result of incorporating information from the field simulation study conducted during the first eight months of production increased to  bbls or oil per day by the end of as a result of drilling additional wells during the year 
prices for crude oil averaged per bbl pursuant to terms of an operating service agreement from venezuela compared with per bbl for our operating expenses decreased million  or percent  which included a fuel gas charge of million  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the fuel gas charge related to a dispute regarding a difference between rates we paid and rates claimed by pdvsa for natural gas used as fuel for the period through depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with primarily due to decreased proved reserves 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during as a result of a decrease in proved reserves 
we recognized write downs of capitalized costs of million associated with exploration activities during the year ended december  compared with million associated with exploration activities in california 
general and administrative expenses decreased million from million in to million in  exclusive of million of non recurring costs 
non recurring general and administrative costs are comprised of million in debt exchange cost  million in california lease relinquishment  million relocation costs to houston and million severance and termination payments paid or accrued in taxes other than on income increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to increased venezuelan municipal taxes 
investment income and other decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the reduction of debt balances  partially offset by a reduction of capitalized interest expense 
net gain on exchange rates increased million  or percent for the year ended december  compared with this was due to changes in the value of the bolivar 
we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during the year ended december  compared with million in the negative effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate of percent primarily because of the reversal of a us tax valuation allowance 
the reversal related to the potential utilization of net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that these us deferred tax assets will be realized in see note to the audited financial statements in item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
the income attributable to the minority interest decreased million for the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the decreased profitability oil prices of benton vinccler 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the increased income from geoilbent 
our share of revenues from geoilbent was million for the year ended september  compared with revenues of million for the increase of million  or percent  was due to higher world crude oil prices and higher sales quantities 
prices for geoilbent s crude oil averaged per bbl during the year ended september  compared with per bbl for the year ended september  our share of geoilbent oil sales quantities increased by  bbls  or percent  from  bbls sold during the year ended september  to  bbls sold during the year ended september  capital resources and liquidity the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see risk factors 
we require capital principally to service our debt and to fund the following costs drilling and completion costs of wells and the cost of production  treating and transportation facilities  geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
our future rate of growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
additionally  our ability to pay interest on our debt and general corporate overhead is dependent upon the ability of benton vinccler to make loan repayments  dividends and other cash payments to us  however  there may be contractual obligations or legal impediments such as currency controls to receiving dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries 
debt reduction and restructuring program 
we currently have significant debt principal obligations payable in million and million 
as described below  we have reduced our obligations due in by million since september  we further intend to retire the million obligation with the proceeds from the proposed arctic gas sale 
however  in the event we do not close the proposed arctic gas sale  we will be required to review additional strategic alternatives to repay the million of percent senior notes due may we intend to pursue additional open market debt purchases of the obligations due in to further reduce debt 
working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the timing of our semiannual interest payments of approximately million each may and november and by the quarterly payments from pdvsa at the end of the months of february  may  august and november pursuant to the terms of the contract between benton vinccler and pdvsa regarding the south monagas unit 
as a consequence of the timing of these interest payment outflows and the pdvsa payment inflows  our cash balances can increase and decrease dramatically on a few dates during the year 
in each may and november in particular  interest payments at the beginning of the month and pdvsa payments at the end of the month create large swings in our cash balances 
in october  an uncommitted short term working capital facility of billion bolivars approximately million currently was made available to benton vinccler by a venezuelan commercial bank 
the credit facility bears interest at fixed rates for day periods  is guaranteed by us and contains no restrictive or financial ratio covenants 
we believe that similar arrangements will be available to us in future quarters 
at december   there was no outstanding balance 
in february  the venezuelan bolivar was allowed to float against the us dollar 
while the long term impact of this action is uncertain  the short term implication may be difficulty in purchasing us dollars with bolivars and reducing us dollar equivalent amounts of benton vinccler s short term working capital facility 
we are negotiating with a bank to increase the bolivar denominated short term working capital facility to approximately million us dollar equivalent 
we do not expect this action to have a material impact on benton vinccler s operations 
the proposed arctic gas sale can provide the additional funds for both the service of our debt and the development of our assets 
however  in the event we do not close the proposed arctic gas sale  we will be required to review additional strategic alternatives to repay the million of percent senior notes due may we continue to develop sources of additional capital and or reduce or reschedule our cash requirements by various techniques including  but not limited to  the pursuit of one or more of the following alternatives restructure the existing debt  manage the scope and timing of our capital expenditures  substantially all of which are within our discretion  form joint ventures or alliances with financial or other industry partners  there can be no assurance that any of the above alternatives  or some combination thereof  will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in negative working capital of million and a negative current ratio 
this compares with our working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the decrease in working capital of million was primarily due to lower prices and additional investments in and advances to arctic gas company during the year ended december  geoilbent has reduced its capital budget to approximately million  of which million is for the north gubkinskoye field  million is for the south tarakovskoye field  million is to carry out seismic and related exploration activity and million is for natural gas plant economic  technical and feasibility studies 
geoilbent s operating budget includes million for principal payments on the loan facility 
in addition  geoilbent had outstanding accounts payable of million as of december   primarily to contractors and vendors for drilling and construction services 
although geoilbent s reduced capital expenditure budget may help to alleviate any shortfall of funds available to make payments to the banks and its creditors as those payments come due  it is uncertain that geoilbent s cash flow from operations will be sufficient to do so  and it may be necessary for geoilbent to obtain capital contributions from its partners  including the company  to have sufficient funds to make these payments on a timely basis 
although the company may consider making such a capital contribution  there can be no assurances that the company will do so  nor can there be any assurances that geoilbent s other partner will be willing or able to do so 
under russian law  a creditor can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy if the company s payments have been due for more than days 
cash flow from operating activities 
during the year ended december  and  net cash provided by used in operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operating activities decreased by million during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to collections of accrued oil revenues 
cash flow from investing activities 
during the year ended december  and  we had drilling and production related capital expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively 
of the expenditures  million was attributable to the development of the south monagas unit and million was attributable to the delta centro block in venezuela 
in addition  during the year ended december   we increased our investment in arctic gas by million 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately million at the south monagas unit during the next months 
the timing and size of the investments for the south monagas unit are substantially at our discretion 
we anticipate that geoilbent will continue to fund its expenditures through its own cash flow  credit facilities and potentially a shareholder contribution 
our remaining capital commitments worldwide are relatively minimal and are substantially at our discretion 
we will also be required to make interest payments of approximately million related to our outstanding senior notes in april and million in november  assuming we close the proposed arctic gas sale and retire million of the percent senior notes prior to november we continue to assess production levels and commodity prices in conjunction with our capital resources and liquidity requirements 
the results from the new wells drilled in the tucupita field in venezuela under the alliance agreements with schlumberger indicate that the reservoir formation quality is as expected  but may be sensitive to drilling and completion practices 
cash flow from financing activities 
in may  we issued million in percent senior unsecured notes due may   of which we repurchased million at their discounted value in september and november the notes were repurchased with the issuance of million common shares and cash of million plus accrued interest 
in november  we issued million in percent senior unsecured notes due november   of which we subsequently repurchased million at their par value for cash 
interest on all of the notes is due may st and november st of each year 
the indenture agreements provide for certain limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  certain investment and capital expenditures  dividends  mergers and sales of assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the indentures 
we have a deferred drilling and completion obligations under our alliance with schlumberger and with flint south america  inc as well as a lease for our houston office space 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligation total year years years years in thousands long term debt      deferred drilling and completion   building lease total      while we can give you no assurance  we currently believe that our cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings and asset sales if required  will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our planned capital expenditures  investments in and advances to affiliates  and semiannual interest payment obligations for the next months 
our expectation is based upon our current estimate of projected price levels  production and the availability of short term working capital facilities of up to million currently during the time periods between the submission of quarterly invoices to pdvsa by benton vinccler and the subsequent payments of these invoices by pdvsa and other financial alternatives 
actual results could be materially affected if there is a significant decrease in either price or production levels related to the south monagas unit 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including  but not limited to  the level of production and prices  as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business 
additionally  prices for oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control 
however  we currently have significant debt obligations payable in may and november of million and million  respectively 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on the successful implementation of our strategic objectives  in particular the timely close of the proposed arctic gas sale 
while we believe the proposed arctic gas sale will be consummated  there can be no assurance that the transaction will close 
in the event that the transaction does not close  we will be required to review additional strategic alternatives to repay the million due in may in debt  including but not limited to  selling all or part of our existing assets in venezuela and russia  restructuring our debt  some combination thereof  or selling the company 
however  no assurances can be given that any of these steps can be successfully completed or that we ultimately will determine that any of the steps should be taken 
years ended december  and our results of operations for the year ended december  primarily reflected the results for benton vinccler  ca in venezuela  which accounted for substantially all of our production and oil sales revenue 
as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower production from the south monagas unit  oil sales in venezuela were percent higher in compared with realized fees per barrel increased percent from in to in and oil sales quantities decreased percent from mmbbls of oil in to mmbbls of oil in 
our operating expenses from the south monagas unit increased percent primarily due to increased chemical treatment  electricity and natural gas compression station maintenance and operating costs  partially offset by reduced salaries and material costs 
our revenues increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to increased oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower sales quantities 
our sales quantities for the year ended december  from venezuela were mmbbls compared to mmbbls for the year ended december  the decrease in sales quantities of  bbls  or percent  was due primarily to production declines beginning in resulting from the curtailment of the venezuelan development drilling program 
venezuelan production declined to  bbls of oil per day by the end of production increased to  bbls or oil per day by the end of as a result of drilling additional wells during the year 
prices for crude oil averaged per bbl pursuant to terms of an operating service agreement from venezuela compared with per bbl for our operating expenses increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this was primarily due to increased chemical treatment  electricity and natural gas compression station maintenance and operating costs  which were partially offset by reduced salaries and material costs at the south monagas unit in venezuela 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with primarily due to decreased proved reserves and increased future development costs at the south monagas unit 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during we recognized write downs of capitalized costs of million associated with exploration activities in jordan and california during the year ended december  compared with million associated with exploration activities in california  china  senegal and jordan during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the following our reduction in workforce and related restructuring costs in  the write off of the joint interest receivable due from molino energy at december  associated with the california leases  and an allowance for doubtful accounts in  related to amounts owed to us by our former chief executive officer see note to the audited financial statements in item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
taxes other than on income increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to increased venezuelan municipal taxes  which are a function of oil revenues 
investment income and other decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the reduction of debt balances  partially offset by a reduction of capitalized interest expense 
net gain on exchange rates decreased million  or percent for the year ended december  compared with this was due to changes in the value of the bolivar 
we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during the year ended december  compared with a loss of million in this resulted in increased income tax expense of million 
the effective tax rate of percent varies from the us statutory rate of percent primarily because income taxes are paid on profitable operations in foreign jurisdictions and no benefit is provided for net operating losses generated in the us the income attributable to the minority interest increased million for the year ended december  compared to this was primarily due to the increased profitability of benton vinccler 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the increased income from geoilbent 
our share of revenues from geoilbent was million for the year ended september  compared with revenues of million for the increase of million  or percent  was due to significantly higher world crude oil prices partially offset by lower sales quantities 
prices for geoilbent s crude oil averaged per bbl during the year ended september  compared with per bbl for the year ended september  our share of geoilbent oil sales quantities decreased by  bbls  or percent  from  bbls sold during the year ended september  to  bbls sold during the year ended september  the decrease in oil sales was due primarily to the temporary interruption of production in early resulting from an accident during the period that affected certain production facilities 
we recorded extraordinary income of million during the year ended december  related to the repurchase at a discount of million of our senior unsecured notes due in we exchanged a total of million shares of our common stock with a market value of million and cash of million for million in notes 
we also wrote off million in unamortized loan fees related to the notes 
effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
however  our south monagas unit oil sales are based on a fee adjusted quarterly by the percentage change of a basket of crude oil prices instead of by absolute dollar changes 
this dampens both any upward and downward effects of changing prices on our venezuelan oil sales and cash flows 
if the price of oil increases  there could be an increase in our cost for drilling and related services because of increased demand  as well as an increase in oil sales 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
there are presently no restrictions in either venezuela or russia that restrict converting us dollars into local currency 
however  from june through april  venezuela implemented exchange controls which significantly limited the ability to convert local currency into us dollars 
because payments to benton vinccler are made in us dollars into its united states bank account  and benton vinccler was not subject to regulations requiring the conversion or repatriation of those dollars back into venezuela  the exchange controls did not have a material adverse effect on us or benton vinccler 
currently  there are no exchange controls in venezuela or russia that restrict conversion of local currency into us dollars for routine business operations  such as the payments of invoices  debt obligations and dividends 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor in results of operations in venezuela and russia 
with respect to benton vinccler and geoilbent  a significant majority of the sources of funds  including the proceeds from oil sales  our contributions and credit financings  are denominated in us dollars  while local transactions in russia and venezuela are conducted in local currency 
if the rate of increase in the value of the dollar compared with the bolivar continues to be less than the rate of inflation in venezuela  then inflation could be expected to have an adverse effect on benton vinccler 
during the year ended december   our net foreign exchange gain attributable to our venezuelan operation was million 
however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by price controls  tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  by changes in such laws and by changing administrative regulations and the interpretations and application of such rules and regulations 
in addition  various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and results 
significant accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
all intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
we account for our investment in geoilbent and arctic gas based on a fiscal year ending september oil and natural gas revenue is accrued monthly based on sales 
each quarter  benton vinccler invoices pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted us dollar contract service fees per barrel 
the operating service agreement provides for benton vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
the operating fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the special energy index of the us consumer price index 
the maximum total fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the average of certain world crude oil prices 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties with costs accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as incurred  including exploration overhead 
only overhead that is directly identified with acquisition  exploration or development activities is capitalized 
all costs related to production  general corporate overhead and similar activities are expensed as incurred 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we regularly evaluate our unproved properties on a country by country basis for possible impairment 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration and acquisition costs associated with the country are expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
the full cost method of accounting uses proved reserves in the calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are those which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly  and the estimation of reserves involves judgmental determinations 
reserve estimates must be reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data and economic changes 
the estimates are based on current technology and economic conditions  and we consider such estimates to be reasonable and consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and extent of production 
the estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future  or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and or marketing contracts are not in place 
changes in previous estimates of proved reserves result from new information obtained from production history and changes in economic factors 
we perform a quarterly cost center ceiling test of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant estimates pertain to proved oil  plant products and gas reserve volumes and the future development costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is after june   sfas also establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas also requires unallocated negative goodwill in a case where the purchase price is less than fair market value of the acquired assets to be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain  rather than deferred and amortized 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas are goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period for intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to years 
in august  the fasb also approved sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas replaces sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the new accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
sfas requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally are to be applied prospectively 
these statements are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb also approved for issuance sfas asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets such as wells and production facilities 
sfas guidance covers the timing of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
the company will adopt the statement effective no later than january   as required 
the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of this statement on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cost reductions in an effort to reduce general and administrative expenses  we closed our carpinteria  california office 
we completed our relocation to houston  texas 
the technical capabilities of the field offices managing the key foreign assets have been enhanced  particularly in venezuela 
accountability has been transferred our offices in maturin  venezuela and western siberia  russia 
venezuelan operating costs were reviewed and reduced to per bbl before a non recurring charge for fuel gas use for the period of through compared with average operating cost of per bbl in we expect operating costs to average between and per bbl sold in risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating the company 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
the average price we received for oil in venezuela decreased from approximately per bbl for the year ended december  to per bbl for the year ended december  during the same period  the average price we received for oil in russia increased from per bbl to per bbl 
our venezuelan oil sales are based on a fee adjusted quarterly by the percentage change of a basket of crude oil prices instead of by absolute dollar changes  which dampens both any upward and downward effects of changing prices on our venezuelan oil sales and cash flows 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause this fluctuation include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  particularly those in russia and the middle east  and overall economic conditions 
new york stock exchange delisting 
in october  we received a letter from the new york stock exchange nyse notifying us that we have fallen below the continued listing standards of the nyse 
these standards include a total market capitalization of at least million over a day trading period and stockholders equity of at least million 
according to the nyse s notice  our total market capitalization over the trading days ended october   was million  and our stockholders equity as of september   was million 
in accordance with the nyse s rules  we submitted a plan to the nyse in december detailing how we expect to reestablish compliance with the listing criteria within the next months 
in january  the nyse accepted our business plan  subject to quarterly reviews of the goals and objectives outlined in that plan 
these initiatives include continued cost reductions  production enhancements  selling all or part of our assets in venezuela and or russia  restructuring the debt or some combination of these alternatives 
failure to achieve the financial and operational goals may result in being subject to nyse trading suspension at the point the initiative or goal is not met 
as a result of a delisting  an investor will find it more difficult to dispose or obtain quotations or market value of our common stock  which may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock 
however  given the successful execution of our strategic plan referenced above  we are optimistic that we will be able to meet the nyse requirements in the future and consequently  do not expect our stock to be delisted 
as of december   our stockholders equity was million  and as of march  our market capitalization was in excess of million 
the proposed arctic gas sale may not close 
while we can give you no assurance  we currently believe that our cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings and asset sales if required  will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our planned capital expenditures  investments in and advances to affiliates  and semiannual interest payment obligations for the next months 
our expectation is based upon our current estimate of projected price levels  production and the availability of short term working capital facilities of up to million currently during the time periods between the submission of quarterly invoices to pdvsa by benton vinccler and the subsequent payments of these invoices by pdvsa and other financial alternatives 
actual results could be materially affected if there is a significant decrease in either price or production levels related to the south monagas unit 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including  but not limited to  the level of production and prices  as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business 
additionally  prices for oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control 
however  we currently have significant debt obligations payable in may and november of million and million  respectively 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on the successful implementation of our strategic objectives  in particular the timely closing of the proposed arctic gas sale 
while we believe the proposed arctic gas sale will be consummated  there can be no assurance that the transaction will close 
in the event that the proposed arctic gas sale does not close  we will be required to review additional strategic alternatives to repay the million in debt  including but not limited to  selling all or part of our existing assets in venezuela and russia  restructuring our debt  some combination thereof  or selling the company 
however  no assurances can be given that any of these steps can be successfully completed or that we ultimately will determine that any of the steps should be taken 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
undeveloped reserves  by their nature  are less certain 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the estimates of our future reserves include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the securities and exchange commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and our risks or the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
leverage materially affects our operations 
even if the proposed arctic gas sale is completed  we remain leveraged 
as of december   our long term debt was million 
our long term debt represented percent of our total capitalization at december  if the proposed arctic gas sale closes  our debt level will be reduced to percent of our total capitalization 
our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  the high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the indentures governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default or a change of control 
lower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
in  we recorded after tax write downs of million million pre tax 
since  we recorded no ceiling limitation write downs 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling limitation write downs in the future 
we perform quarterly cost center ceiling tests of our oil and gas properties 
no ceiling test write downs were required in we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
our future oil production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  and shortages in experienced labor or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pump and pipe failures  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
the events of september  forced changes to our insurance coverage 
acts of terrorism are excluded risks from our property insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
our concentration of assets increases our exposure to production declines 
during  the production from the south monagas unit in venezuela represented approximately percent of our total production from consolidated companies 
our production  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if production from the south monagas unit decreases significantly 
venezuela is a member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  which has collectively reduced crude oil exports in an attempt to increase crude oil prices 
we have been required to curtail sales to pdvsa from time to time due to their insufficient crude oil storage capacity 
we cannot be assured that our sales to pdvsa will not be curtailed in the future in the same manner 
in march  the managers of pdvsa are challenging the replacement of their senior management by the president of venezuela 
the implications of this unrest are uncertain at this date 
our international operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and economic and political developments 
we have substantially all of our operations in venezuela and russia 
the expenses of such operations are payable in local currency while most of the revenue from oil sales is paid in us dollars 
as a result  our operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the bolivar  ruble and us dollar 
our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other laws or policies in these countries  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in other countries 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various foreign governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  our operations are subject to taxation policies  that in russia have changed significantly 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
foreign currency risk 
we have significant operations outside of the united states  principally in venezuela and russia 
both venezuela and russia have historically been considered highly inflationary economies 
operations in those countries are re measured in united states dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the statement of income 
we attempt to manage our operations in a manner to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
however  there are many factors which affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the united states dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
in february  venezuela elected to float the bolivar  resulting in approximately a percent devaluation 
our venezuelan receipts are denominated in us dollars  while most expenditures are in bolivars 
management does not expect the devaluation to have a material impact 
foreign operations risk 
our operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
venezuela has had labor strikes and demonstrations in and the first quarter of the implications and results of this unrest are uncertain at this time 
we are dependent on cash flows received from benton vinccler to fund our us expenses  including interest expenses for the million of percent senior notes and the million of percent senior notes 
if venezuela imposed currency restrictions which prohibited our receipt of funds from benton vinccler  our ability to meet our interest payments would be adversely affected 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and the possibility of having to be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states 
to date  our international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
minority ownership in geoilbent 
we own percent in geoilbent 
we are reviewing ways to improve the operations  but we are a minority partner and therefore may not be able to fully influence changes in the daily operations  if indicated by our review 
geoilbent has reduced its capital budget to approximately million  of which million is for the north gubkinskoye field  million is for the south tarakovskoye field  million is to carry out seismic and related exploration activity and million is for natural gas plant economic  technical and feasibility studies 
geoilbent s operating budget includes million for principal payments on the loan facility 
in addition  geoilbent had outstanding accounts payable of million as of december   primarily to contractors and vendors for drilling and construction services 
although geoilbent s reduced capital expenditure budget may help to alleviate any shortfall of funds available to make payments to the banks and its creditors as those payments come due  it is uncertain that geoilbent s cash flow from operations will be sufficient to do so  and it may be necessary for geoilbent to obtain capital contributions from its partners  including the company  to have sufficient funds to make these payments on a timely basis 
although the company may consider making such a capital contribution  there can be no assurances that the company will do so  nor can there be any assurances that geoilbent s other partner will be willing or able to do so 
under russian law  a creditor can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy if the company s payments have been due for more than days 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange  as discussed below 
oil and natural gas prices as an independent oil and natural gas producer  our revenue  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and condensate 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
this volatility is demonstrated by the average realizations in venezuela  which declined from per bbl in to in and increased to in  then back down to in based on our budgeted production and costs  we will require an average realization in venezuela of approximately relates to west texas intermediate benchmark price per bbl in in order to break even on income from consolidated companies before our equity in earnings from affiliated companies 
we have not hedged our oil production since while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
interest rates total long term debt at december   consisted of million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes maturing in million and million on debt 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material affect on our results of operations for the year ended december  foreign exchange our operations are located primarily outside of the united states 
in particular  our current oil producing operations are located in venezuela and russia  countries which have had recent histories of significant inflation and devaluation 
for the venezuelan operations  oil sales are received under a contract in effect through in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency 
for the russian operations  a majority of the oil sales are received in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency  although a larger percentage of the expenditures are in local currency 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in these countries  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in these countries
