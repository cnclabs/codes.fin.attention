item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is to help facilitate an understanding of the significant factors influencing our historical operating results  financial condition and cash flows and also to convey management s expectations of the potential impact of known trends  events or uncertainties that may materially impact future results 
our md a should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k 
overview we are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states 
our services assist employers  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups  managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in delivering prescription drugs in a cost effective manner 
our pharmaceutical services are generally referred to as pharmacy benefit management  or pbm  services and involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety  effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use 
we dispense prescription drugs on behalf of our customers through our three large  automated mail service pharmacies and our seventeen smaller regional pharmacies as well as through a nationwide network composed of over  independent retail pharmacies 
our net revenue generally includes amounts paid or payable by our customers based on the price of prescription drugs dispensed on their behalf and administrative fees 
the preponderance of our net revenue is earned on a fee for service basis through contracts covering one to three year periods 
revenues for selected types of services are earned based on a percentage of savings achieved or on a per capita basis 
our cost of revenues is primarily composed of prescription drug acquisition costs and associated dispensing costs 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition discontinued operations 
our financial statements are prepared using discontinued operations accounting for our discontinued ppm business 
under discontinued operations accounting  we accrued estimates of our expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through their eventual discharge  which  in many cases  was expected to be several years in the future 
there are primarily two remaining liabilities related to our discontinued ppm operations  leases and litigation  which continue to require significant judgements and estimates on the part of our management 
our accrual for lease liabilities could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
these factors are significantly dependent on the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
our accrual for litigation is based on our lawyers estimates of legal expenses and probable losses for eventual settlement of lawsuits 
this litigation could take several years to complete 
accordingly  actual legal fees and  possibly  damage awards or settlements  could differ significantly from our estimates 
while we believe our current estimates of discontinued operations liabilities are adequate  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
trade receivables sales facility 
we have sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in certain of our trade accounts receivable to unrelated third parties under a million revolving trade receivables sales facility  which is described in further detail at historical liquidity and capital resources trade receivables sales facility below 
the unrelated third parties  referred to as the conduit  had purchased a million interest in our accounts receivable under this facility at december  transactions occurring under our trade receivables sales facility can be summarized as follows caremark generates accounts receivable from its customers through the ordinary course of business 
certain of these receivables are required to be sold to mp receivables company  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of caremark 
mp receivables only business activities relate to acquiring and selling interests in certain of caremark s receivables 
mp receivables is included with our other subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements  and the activity between caremark and mp receivables is eliminated during the consolidation process 
mp receivables sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in each individual receivable to the conduit at a discount and uses the cash collected on these receivables to purchase additional receivables from caremark 
additionally  mp receivables pays funds to  or receives funds from  the conduit for the discount on the purchased receivables which we include in interest expense or to increase or decrease the conduit s ownership percentage of its accounts receivable 
the trade receivables sales facility represents off balance sheet financing  since the conduit s ownership interest in mp receivables accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our balance sheet  rather than resulting in a liability to the conduit 
since the conduit purchases accounts receivable from mp receivables on a revolving basis  we currently have access to all of the cash collections on our accounts receivable 
upon the facility s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on mp receivables accounts receivable until its net investment million at december  had been repaid 
because mp receivables and caremark are separate legal entities  the assets held by mp receivables would not be available to satisfy the claims of our creditors until after all amounts due and owing by mp receivables to the conduit have been paid in full 
during  the conduit s ownership of mp receivables accounts receivable fluctuated between million and million  and averaged million 
amounts due to the conduit fluctuate based on the conduit s net investment  which cannot exceed million 
we believe that the terms of the agreements governing this facility qualify our trade receivables sales transactions for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment allows us to account for mp receivables transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as long term debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
absent this sale treatment  our balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and long term debt  which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital 
our results of operations would not be impacted  however 
see historical liquidity and capital resources trade receivable sales facility 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
certain of our accounts receivable which are not subject to the trade receivables sales facility discussed above are generated on a fee for service basis and are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time 
we continually review and refine the estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible  however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these accounts receivable 
income taxes 
we have a history of unprofitable operations from losses incurred in our discontinued ppm business 
the year was the first year out of the last five in which we have reported net income and taxable income 
these losses generated a sizeable federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforward of approximately billion as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations and to the continuing uncertainties surrounding our discontinued operations as discussed above  we have not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates  rather than the rate currently being used 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgement in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to market our services profitably  successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
our future operating results and financial condition may be affected by a number of additional factors  including i our ability to successfully terminate leases and other contractual agreements related to our discontinued operations and the outcome of various litigation surrounding the closure or sale of our ppm business  ii identification of and competition for growth and expansion opportunities  iii declining reimbursement levels for products distributed  iv exposure to liabilities in excess of our insurance  v compliance with  or changes in  government regulation  including pharmacy licensing requirements and healthcare reform legislation  vi adverse resolution of existing or future lawsuits  vii costs of modifications of our information systems to comply with hipaa privacy and electronic interchange standards and viii liquidity and capital requirements 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition 
there are various legal matters which  if adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

results of continuing operations the following tables set forth selected unaudited information about our results of continuing operations for each of the years ended december   and year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net revenue    operating expenses cost of revenues    selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization    interest expense  net    income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes    income from continuing operations    income from continuing operations per common share diluted operating income operating margin ebitda    ebitda margin pharmacy claims processed millions mail retail year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net revenue    operating expenses cost of revenues    selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization    interest expense  net    income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes    income from continuing operations    income from continuing operations per common share diluted operating income operating margin ebitda    ebitda margin pharmacy claims processed millions mail retail we define operating income as net revenue less cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization 
we define ebitda as net revenue less cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of continuing operations for compared to net revenue 
the growth in net revenue in was due primarily to new customer contracts which began on january   coupled with retention and growth of existing customers  additional services provided to existing customers  increases in the volume of pharmacy claims processed and drug cost inflation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased on an absolute basis due to the factors cited above for the increase in net revenue but remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in in line with the overall growth in our business and remained constant as a percentage of net revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization in was due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures made in and interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from our retirement of our million senior subordinated notes in september  as well as a reduction in amounts due under our credit facility which were funded from operating cash flows and the taps proceeds as described below 
interest expense was also positively impacted by lower average interest rates applicable to both the credit facility and the trade receivables sales facility  which are subject to variable interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was for both the and periods 
this effective rate is significantly below the statutorily enacted corporate income tax rates applicable to our taxable income for each period and is the result of i the tax nol carryforwards discussed below and ii state tax planning strategies which will allow us to utilize our consolidated state tax nols in certain states 
results of continuing operations for compared to net revenue 
the growth in net revenue in was due primarily to new customer contracts  including two managed care contracts added since the second quarter of coventry health care  inc  the largest of the two managed care contracts  began on january   and is reflected only in revenues  while oxford health plans  the smaller contract which was restructured in as described in historical liquidity and capital resources cash flows from continuing operations below  began during the third quarter of adding these managed care contracts resulted in higher revenues and higher average revenue per customer  however  the coventry contract has a high concentration of retail claims when compared to our other customers 
this concentration of retail claims results in a lower gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for this contract when compared to our other contracts  and the size of these managed care contracts is significant enough to reduce our consolidated gross margin as well 
the increase in net revenue in also reflects retention and growth of existing customers  additional services provided to existing customers  increases in the volume of pharmacy claims processed and drug cost inflation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased on an absolute basis due to the factors cited above for the increase in net revenue 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue reflects the lower gross margins associated with the managed care contracts as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was in line with the overall growth in our business but decreased as a percentage of net revenue primarily because of the increases in net revenue associated with the managed care contracts discussed above 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization in was due primarily to amortization expense associated with our purchase of certain pharmacy assets from oxford health plans in conjunction with entering into the managed care contract discussed above 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from our retirement of our million senior subordinated notes in september  as well as a reduction in amounts due under our credit facility which were funded from operating cash flows and the approximately million in proceeds we received from the maturity of our threshold appreciation price securities taps  in the reduction in interest expense due to reduced debt levels was offset by increases in interest rates applicable to both the credit facility and the trade receivables sales facility  which are subject to variable interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
see the discussion of income taxes in the comparison of to above 
results of discontinued operations during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million as a result of our progress in completing the exit from our ppm operations 
this charge included a million adjustment in the net assets of our remaining ppm operations and million in adjustments to reserves for potential future obligations such as rents and litigation 
these amounts are estimates  and actual costs could differ from those recorded 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million related to the net loss on the disposal of our ppm operations  including a million adjustment to the impairment and write off of intangibles and other ppm assets  an adjustment to the estimated costs to exit our ppm operations of approximately million  and an adjustment of approximately million related to the gain on the sale of our contract services business 
for the year ended december   our discontinued operations had net revenue of approximately billion and an operating loss of approximately million 
we received net cash proceeds of million and million during from the sales of our ppm and contract services businesses  respectively 
net interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  historical liquidity and capital resources general 
we broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing to meet our business objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
the following tables set forth selected information concerning our liquidity and capital resources and changes therein at and for the year ended december  in millions net cash and cash equivalents provided by used in continuing operations investing activities financing activities discontinued operations special charges net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents december  cash and cash equivalents december  net working capital deficiency december  december  december  december  long term debt fixed rate debt variable rate debt availability under revolving credit facility working capital equals total current assets minus total current liabilities excluding current portion of long term debt cash flows from continuing operations 
our performance relative to cash and cash equivalents provided by continuing operations for the year ended december   resulted from factors discussed above related to income from continuing operations coupled with focused management of working capital  including the changes related to inventory discussed below 
additionally  cash provided by operating activities includes million received from oxford health plans under an agreement whereby we and oxford restructured our business relationship 
this amount will be amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the restructured agreement  which expires in september cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december   consist of million of capital expenditures  offset by million of funds received from oxford under the agreement referred to above 
approximately million of our capital expenditures in relate to our relocation of our illinois automated mail service pharmacy from lincolnshire to a larger facility located in nearby mount prospect 
we began dispensing prescriptions from the mount prospect pharmacy during the second quarter of and completed the transition of all lincolnshire operations to mount prospect during the third quarter of cash flows from financing activities 
we received net proceeds of million from issuance of our common stock under employee benefit plans and million of returned escrowed funds related to our taps during the year ended december  these amounts were offset by payments of preferred security dividends of million  payment of million of costs associated with renewing our credit facility  and principal payments on long term debt of million 
cash flows from discontinued operations 
in addition to the amounts paid through december   to service liabilities which arose from our discontinued ppm operations  we have accrued approximately million of remaining net liabilities related to our discontinued operations 
we expect to pay approximately million of this accrued amount during with the majority of the remainder being paid in these amounts are estimates  and actual amounts could differ from those recorded 
working capital 
we generally operate with negative working capital due to i the sale of accounts receivable under our trade receivables sales facility and ii the inclusion of net current liabilities related to our discontinued operations in the computation of working capital 
the increase in working capital from december  to december   is due primarily to our operating cash flow performance during the period offset by payments of discontinued operations liabilities 
changes in inventory levels 
in march  we entered into a pharmaceutical wholesale supply agreement with mckesson corporation 
this agreement became effective on july   and replaced an existing agreement with another supplier 
under this agreement  we will continue to purchase pharmaceuticals both directly from certain manufacturers and from mckesson  however  we have shifted purchases of several products formerly purchased on a direct basis to mckesson in order to take advantage of beneficial terms of the mckesson agreement 
this agreement resulted in a significant reduction in our inventory balances to million at december   from million at december  this reduction was made possible primarily through a shift toward just in time delivery and electronic data interchange with mckesson 
credit facility 
we have a million credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent which was put in place on march  this credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility maturing in march and a million term loan facility maturing in march this facility replaced our former credit facility  which was scheduled to mature in june at december   borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  plus varying margins and consisted of outstanding term loans of million 
we began making required principal payments of  per quarter with respect to the term loan facility on june  at december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  exclusive of approximately million reserved under letters of credit 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and secured by certain liens and pledges  contains prepayment provisions with respect to certain cash proceeds and contains other customary restrictive covenants 
the security interests  guarantees and covenants applicable to the credit facility are described in further detail in note  long term debt and operating leases to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
senior notes 
our senior notes are in an aggregate principal amount of million and bear interest at annually  with all principal amounts due in october the indenture for the senior notes contains  among other things  restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness  sale and leaseback transactions and consolidation  merger and sale of assets 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by any subsidiary 
the indenture for the senior notes also contains restrictions on indebtedness secured by liens 
to comply with this covenant  we have secured the senior notes on an equal and ratable basis with the credit facility 
trade receivables sales facility 
we have sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable pursuant to a million revolving period trade receivables sales facility with general electric capital corporation gecc as funding agent and the chase manhattan bank chase as group agent collectively referred to as the conduit 
gecc s million commitment under this facility expires in january  and chase s million commitment expires in february at december  and  the conduit had purchased an interest in approximately million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable owned by our mp receivables company subsidiary 
mp receivables retained interest in these accounts receivable  excluding the million restricted capital amount described below  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
delinquent amounts and credit losses on these receivables have historically been immaterial 
we are required by the terms of the facility to maintain million of net assets in mp receivables 
to comply with this requirement  we have classified million of mp receivables retained interest in the trade accounts receivable subject to the facility as other assets rather than accounts receivable in the audited consolidated balance sheets which appear on page f of this annual report on form k 
additionally  this facility is structured so that the accounts receivable sold to the conduit are segregated from the remainder of our assets 
the collections on these receivables must be used to satisfy the conduit s interest in these receivables before they are available to be used by us to satisfy our other obligations 
outlook liquidity and capital resources overview 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from i funding discontinued operations including the funding of any retained liabilities  ii commitments related to financing obtained through the issuance of long term debt and our convertible preferred securities  iii working capital requirements and iv capital expenditures 
additionally  subject to certain restrictions in the credit facility  we may seek to acquire businesses in the future and could fund any such acquisition using cash on hand or availability under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments continuing operations 
we have various contractual obligations and or commercial commitments arising from both our continuing and discontinued operations 
these obligations and commitments are more fully described in this annual report on form k under various headings in md a as well as in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to our continuing operations at december  in millions payments due under contractual obligations total after long term debt term loan facility long term debt senior subordinated notes operating leases conduit s net investment in trade accounts receivable convertible preferred securities see historical liquidity and capital resources credit facility and financial statement note  long term debt and operating leases

anticipated impact of patent expirations for certain drugs 
the patent held by the inventor of a high utilization drug expired in the third quarter of  and several similar patents held by other inventors or manufacturers are scheduled to begin expiring in the near future 
we anticipate that these patent expirations will have the effect of lowering net revenue as prescriptions begin to be filled with generic equivalent drugs instead of the formerly patented drugs  however  based on our experience to date we believe that our gross margins and overall profitability should be favorably impacted due to the associated lower cost of the generic equivalent drugs 
planned capital expenditures 
we expect total capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
in  we plan to build a fourth automated mail service pharmacy in phoenix  arizona  in order to meet projected demand 
we have entered into a long term operating lease for the associated real property and expect to make approximately million to million of capital expenditures  consisting primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and specialized mail service pharmacy automation equipment 
additionally  we continue to evaluate the scope of modifications of our information systems needed to comply with applicable hipaa rules 
we expect that hipaa requirements will result in additional capital expenditures over the level required for maintenance and growth of our operations through  which is the scheduled deadline for hipaa compliance 
we do not expect costs associated with hipaa to materially impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
principal payment for excess cash flows 
we will be required to make a term loan principal payment of approximately million in april under the excess cash flow covenant contained in our credit facility 
this payment will be made in addition to the scheduled principal payments of million in discontinued operations 
future cash needed to fund the remaining net liabilities of discontinued operations and estimated exit costs  which was estimated to be approximately million  in aggregate  at december   will be funded by cash flows from continuing operations and by borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund these payments  which we expect to total approximately million in  with the majority of the remaining amount expected to be paid in we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising from our discontinued operations 
these primarily include obligations under various leases for commercial real estate 
these leases had aggregate remaining rental payments  net of amounts to be paid to us under subleases  of approximately million at december   due as follows million  million  million and after million 
these amounts represent totals for our net existing contractual obligations under these various leases and do not reflect our estimates of the effects of early termination 
additionally  we are named as guarantor or obligor on additional discontinued operations real estate leases which we assigned to third parties 
the aggregate amount of these guarantees totaled approximately million at december   and expire as follows million  million  million and after million 
additional information concerning the remaining contractual obligations and commercial commitments related to our discontinued operations can be found in note  discontinued operations and related contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
deferred income taxes 
we had nol carryforwards of approximately billion as of december  if not utilized to offset future taxable income  these nol carryforwards will expire on various dates through in addition to these nol carryforwards  we had approximately million of future additional income tax deductions as of december   related to our discontinued operations 
we also have a federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million  which may be used to offset our ordinary federal corporate income taxes in the future 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  we are required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize the deferred tax asset to offset future taxes 
as previously discussed  management believes that  based upon all available historical information and after considering appropriate tax planning strategies in light of the uncertainty of forecasting future taxable income  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the amount of the deferred tax assets in excess of the deferred tax liabilities 
however  the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible and nols can be carried forward 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas revised the standard for accounting for transfers of financial assets and requires additional disclosures  however  it left intact most of the provisions of fasb statement no 
 under which we had previously accounted for our trade receivables sales facility transactions 
fas is effective for all transfers and servicing of financial assets occurring after march   however  the expanded disclosure requirements of fas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and are reflected in note  trade receivables sales facility 
we adopted the accounting requirements of fas on april  the adoption of fas had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
business combinations initiated after june   must be accounted for under the provisions of these two statements 
we must also apply these provisions to previously recorded business combinations as of january  the principal provisions of fas and fas are as follows all business combinations initiated after june   will be accounted for using the purchase method  under which the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair market values with the residual amount being recorded as goodwill 
the pooling of interests method  under which the financial statements of the acquirer and the acquiree were combined as if the two businesses had always been one  will no longer be used 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets will no longer be amortized over a maximum period of forty years 
goodwill will not be amortized but will instead be tested for impairment annually or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events 
identifiable intangible assets will be amortized over their expected useful lives  those with indefinite expected useful lives will not be amortized 
identifiable intangible assets will continue to be tested for impairment under previously existing accounting standards 
additionally  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas and no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas during fas relates to obligations which generally are incurred in connection with the ownership of real property 
we currently lease the substantial majority of our real property and  therefore  do not believe that the provisions of fas apply to our current operations 
fas superseded statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
fas also amended accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
we adopted fas  fas  fas and fas on january   and expect the adoption of these standards to have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to debt outstanding under our credit facility and for the discount on revolving sales of accounts receivable under our trade receivables sales facility 
our earnings and the market value of our fixed rate debt are subject to change as a result of movements in market interest rates 
at december   we had million of obligations which were subject to variable rates of interest 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of from the rate at december   would result in an increase in annual interest expense of million  presuming that obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined based on only the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding obligations and do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment
