overview we provide network management services that allow enterprises and carriers to outsource some or all network specific activities in order to increase network reliability and uptime  reduce overall network costs  and simplify timely migration to new technologies 
we were incorporated in september in the state of delaware and began operating during the second half of until december  substantially all of our services revenues were derived from the sale of data transport services 
to provide these transport services  we leased network transmission facilities from major carriers  and we also resold at t s transport services 
we began developing our first remote network management service offering for wans in early and began offering that service  together with at t s transport services  in the quarter ended march  we began selling network management services separately from our data transport services in the quarter ended march  we introduced our first security service in the quarter ended september  we discontinued our data transport business in the quarter ended december  we began offering network management services for lans in the quarter ended june  we began offering virtual private network vpn management services during the quarter ended september  on june   we announced that ibm global services will offer netsolve s prowatch suite of managed network services worldwide 
the acceptance of our first software licensing agreement occurred in the quarter ended september  this agreement allows another organization to utilize our technology to provide remote network management services to its customers 
additionally  on october   we announced that we will offer remote network management for cisco systems  inc architecture for voice  video and integrated data avvid internet protocol ip telephony ipt 
revenues our revenues consist of network management services revenues as well as equipment resales and other revenues 
our network management services include both recurring and nonrecurring revenues 
revenues from recurring services represent monthly fees charged to resellers or end users for our network management services  software licensing fees  software usage royalties and software maintenance fees 
recurring network management services revenues are typically based on a fixed monthly fee per customer site or device and are recognized in the period in which the services are rendered 
for fiscal year  approximately of network management services revenues were from recurring services 

nonrecurring network management services consist of data network design  project implementation services  equipment installation services  one time project and development assignments that assist resellers in defining and creating new network management services and software professional fees 
nonrecurring network management services primarily relate to services performed to assist customers in implementing new networks 
nonrecurring network management revenues are also earned when implementing network management services for existing networks  however  the level of work and related fees are both lower 
nonrecurring network management services revenues are generally recognized upon completion of the assignment or service 
for example  we charge fees for project implementation services on a per location or per device basis and we recognize revenues associated with these services upon completion of the network implementation for the location or device 
our network management services revenues are derived from contracts with telecommunications carriers  value added resellers of networking equipment and services  and enterprises sold to by our direct sales force 
our services include both initial implementation and project management services for a one time fee per location as well as ongoing management services for a fixed monthly fee per managed device 
network management services revenues also include software licensing  usage royalties  maintenance fees and professional fees 
our contracts with end users are generally for terms of to months  although customers may cancel services prior to the end of the service terms 
cancellations due to reasons other than closings of managed locations  which to date have not been material  are generally subject to cancellation fees ranging from to of the recurring charges payable for the remainder of the service term 
cancellation fees as a percentage of network management services revenues were less than in each of fiscal years and we recognize revenues from cancellation fees on a cash basis unless collection is assured 
our contracts with resellers typically extend from to months and  in most cases  require that we continue providing services throughout the term of the reseller s contract with the end user 
in these cases  we continue to recognize revenues upon performance of the services  even if performance occurs after the term of the contract with the reseller 
our network management services for wans typically include a guarantee providing end to end network availability for at least of the time in any given month 
in the event the guaranteed availability is not achieved  we generally are obligated to refund all or a portion of our wan management fees for that month 
this guarantee covers some components of the end user s wan  such as the transport services provided by the end user s carrier  that are not directly under our control 
as a result  we may  in some instances  refund amounts to customers for circumstances beyond our control 
we establish a reserve against guarantees we offer 
historically  guarantee payments have not been material in relation to network management services revenues 
however  in the future  refunds made under our guarantees or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations 
we derive equipment and other revenues from the resale of customer premise equipment  or cpe  and from the sale of cpe maintenance contracts to certain of our network management services customers 
cpe is networking equipment which usually resides at the customer s location and includes routers  customer service units or csus  and lan switches 
we utilize cpe produced by cisco and  to a lesser extent  by bay nortel  visual networks and others 
we recognize equipment revenues in the period the cpe is shipped to the customer 
however  if the transaction is financed through our lease financing subsidiary  we recognize the revenues upon sale of the underlying lease contract on a nonrecourse basis 
we recognize revenues from cpe maintenance contracts on a monthly basis as the services are provided 
we only resell cpe to our network management services customers 
although we believe some of our customers will continue to purchase cpe from us  our strategy is to focus on our network management services which generate higher margins 
we therefore anticipate that revenues from cpe sales will continue to decline as we seek to manage our mix of revenues 
we currently have two primary reseller agreements with at t  one for managed router service and one for managed dsu service 
at t accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal year  of our total revenues in fiscal year  and of our total revenues in fiscal year we anticipate that sales to at t will continue to comprise a substantial percentage of our revenues in fiscal  but believe the percentage will continue to decline 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal years  or in january  we entered into a new amendment to our agreement with at t relating to the managed router services which accounted for of our total revenues  of our total network management services revenues and of our recurring network management services revenues in fiscal year the pricing terms of the new amendment include discounts on our services that we estimate will reduce recurring management revenues by approximately  for the quarter ending june   and an additional  for the quarter ending september  with prices increasing slightly thereafter 
historically  we have generated substantially all of our revenues from sales to customers in the united states  although we manage devices in several locations around the world for these us based customers 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year network management services 
revenues from network management services increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the increase was due to increased recurring revenues resulting from a growth in the number of managed devices under contract 
equipment and other 
revenues from equipment and other decreased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year revenues from equipment and other sales decreased primarily as a result of lower equipment sales due to lower demand caused by a general slowdown of corporate spending on network infrastructures 
costs of revenues cost of network management services 
cost of network management services includes salary and other costs of personnel  depreciation of equipment utilized to manage customer networks  the network management infrastructure utilized to provide remote network management services  and the costs of third party providers of cpe installation services 
cost of network management services is expensed as incurred 
cost of network management services increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of network management services revenues in fiscal year and of such revenues in fiscal year the dollar and percentage increase was due primarily to the addition of personnel and network management infrastructure enhancements that should allow us to scale efficiently going forward in anticipation of continued growth 
cost of equipment and other 
cost of equipment and other includes the purchase of cpe from manufacturers and distributors and maintenance contracts purchased for resale to end users 
these costs are expensed in the period the related revenues are recognized 
cost of equipment and other decreased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of equipment and other revenues in fiscal year and of equipment and other revenues in fiscal year the decrease in dollars was primarily due to the decrease in equipment sales 
the decrease in percentage was due to an increase in cpe maintenance revenue as a percentage of equipment and other revenue which generally has higher gross margins than equipment sales 
operating expenses development 
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of development personnel  including contract programming services 
development employees are responsible for developing internal software systems  selecting and integrating purchased software applications  developing software tools for our network management services  developing our web enabled software applications that give customers access to network management information  and defining and developing operating processes for new services 
development expenses increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in both fiscal years and the increase in dollars was due to an increase in the number of software and service development personnel devoted to the development and enhancement of network management tools and our network management services and increased use of software development consulting services 
development costs of approximately  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year were capitalized to match against software license fees under a licensing agreement with a three year term 
selling and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel and costs associated with creating awareness of our services 
sales and marketing expenses increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in both fiscal years and the increase in dollars was due to increased costs related to the addition of sales and marketing personnel 
this increase was partially offset by decreased spending for advertising during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as well as the one time costs incurred in fiscal year of  in connection with the acquisition of certain of comdisco s customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses related to our human resources  finance and executive departments 
included in human resources spending is a majority of costs of recruiting and relocating new employees 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to approximately million of additional spending related to rent and operating costs of a leased facility that we will occupy in the quarter ending june  as we consolidate substantially all of our operations into the new facility as noted in item facilities 
we therefore anticipate that our quarterly costs for facilities which are included in general and administrative costs will decline by approximately  per quarter beginning with the quarter ending september other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash balances  slightly offset by interest expense from our leases for capital equipment 
other income  net decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates earned on invested cash during fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues total revenues 
total revenues increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year network management services 
revenues from network management services increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the increase was due almost entirely to increased recurring revenues resulting from a growth in the number of managed devices under contract 
equipment and other 
revenues from equipment and other decreased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of amendments we have made to some of our reseller agreements whereby we receive management fees for ordering cpe and managing cpe inventories for these resellers as well as fewer installations of new networks which drive cpe sales 
the decrease was partially offset by increased cpe maintenance revenue due to an increase in the number of equipment maintenance contracts in place 
costs of revenues cost of network management services 
cost of network management services increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of network management services revenues in fiscal year and of such revenues in fiscal year the dollar and percentage increase was due primarily to the addition of personnel and network management infrastructure enhancements that should allow us to scale efficiently going forward in anticipation of continued growth 
cost of equipment and other 
cost of equipment and other decreased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of equipment and other revenues in fiscal year and of equipment and other revenues in fiscal year the decrease in dollars was due to reduced costs of resold equipment resulting from the decrease in equipment resales 
the decrease in costs of resold equipment was partially offset by an increase in maintenance costs which occurred as a result of an increase in the number of maintenance contracts in place 
the percentage decrease was due to increased cpe maintenance revenue which generally has higher gross margins than equipment sales 
operating expenses development 
development expenses increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the increase in dollars was due to an increase in the number of software and service development personnel devoted to the development and enhancement of network management tools and our network management services 
during fiscal year  approximately  of development costs were capitalized to match against software license fees under a three year agreement 
no development costs were capitalized in fiscal year selling and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the increase in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues was due to costs of  incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in connection with the acquisition of customers from comdisco  increased spending for advertising as well as costs related to the addition of sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in both fiscal years and the dollar increase was due primarily to legal fees related to the pending class action securities lawsuit  additional spending related to recruiting and relocating new employees and to being a public company 
other income  net other income  net increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to interest income earned on the net proceeds received from the company s initial public offering 
income tax expense benefit the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year was million  compared to an expense of million for fiscal year the benefit in fiscal year is attributable to a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
since the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was completely eliminated as of march  resulting in the recording of income tax benefits  income tax provisions for periods subsequent to march  are no longer offset by similar benefits 
quarterly results of operations results of operations have varied from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including our ability to renew or retain existing end user and reseller relationships  the cost of introducing new service offerings and the profitability of such offerings  and the level and nature of competition 
further  we may be unable to adjust spending rapidly enough to compensate for any significant fluctuations in the number of new managed devices implemented in a given period 
any significant shortfall in the number of new managed devices could therefore seriously damage our business 
finally  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in the future or  if we are profitable  that our levels of profitability will not vary significantly between quarters

 customers         managed devices         average monthly recurring revenue per customer         liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year we used  during fiscal year to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
we have approval from our board of directors to purchase up to four million shares  including those previously repurchased 
since the inception of the stock repurchase program  the company has repurchased million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other business considerations 
repurchased shares may be held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including for use in connection with the company s stock option plans  or may be retired 
we used million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year to purchase capital assets which includes leasehold improvements related to the addition of our new facility  and to purchase capital assets used in the delivery of our network management services 
as discussed in item facilities  the company plans to consolidate operations in its new facility in the quarter ending june this lease commenced in april and will expire in april if the renewal option is not exercised 
we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we paid  during fiscal year   during fiscal year and  during fiscal year toward our lease obligations for capital equipment 
we have no future commitments for capital leases 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in net accounts receivable and million in working capital 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital needs and capital expenditures  including capital expenditures related to our newly leased facility  and any potential future acquisitions for at least months 
our current cash balances are kept in short term  investment grade  interest bearing securities pending their use 
in the event our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or if we consummate any unplanned acquisitions of businesses or assets  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
sources of additional capital may include public and private equity and debt financings  sales of nonstrategic assets and other financing arrangements 
as of march  and march   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which will expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the company had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  as of march  and march   respectively  which do not expire 
the company also has foreign tax credits of  that expire beginning in if not utilized 
utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses before utilization 
as of march   the company has no debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of march   the company has noncancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million of which million relates to the  square foot facility that we will be exiting in the first quarter of fiscal year at march   the company did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company were engaged in such relationships 
related party transactions the consolidated balance sheets as of march  and include in accounts receivable a  loan to an officer of the company 
the loan is represented by a full recourse note  is payable upon default  bears interest at per annum and is secured by a security interest in all stock options granted to the officer by the company at any time prior to the satisfaction of the loan and all shares of the company s common stock issued upon the exercise of any such options 
critical accounting policies general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition network management services revenues are recognized in the period services are provided by netsolve  whether sold directly or through resellers  based upon rates established by contract 
these amounts are adjusted to the extent of any reserves affecting the realization of these revenues as described below 
the typical contract terms are from to months and provide for one time services  consisting primarily of project implementation services at a fixed fee per customer site or device  as well as recurring services which are provided at a fixed monthly fee per customer site or device over the life of the contract 
revenues for project implementation services are recognized upon completion of the assignment or service  and recurring revenues are recognized on a monthly basis as the services are performed 
revenue from software licensing arrangements is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the licensing agreement s term 
revenue from software royalty fees are based on a flat fee per device and are recognized monthly 
equipment revenues are recognized in the period the equipment is shipped to the customer 
equipment revenues from assets leased by the company s lease financing subsidiary are recognized upon the sale of the equipment and the related lease to a third party lessor on a nonrecourse basis following installation of the equipment 
other revenues  which consist primarily of equipment maintenance services  are recognized in the period services are provided 
receivables we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while losses due to bad debt have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of bad debt losses that we have in the past 
in addition  a significant amount of our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in at t 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of at t could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
availability reserve the company s remote network management services for wans typically include a guarantee providing end to end network availability for at least of the time in any given month 
in the event the guaranteed availability is not achieved  the company generally is obligated to refund its wan management fees for that month 
the company provides a reserve based on the estimated costs of these refunds 
historically  guarantee payments have not been significant

risk factors we may be unable to operate profitably in the future 
we may not operate profitably 
although we began operating in  we did not introduce our first network management service until the quarter ended march  our history of operating profitably in the network management services business is short  and it is difficult to predict our future revenues and operating results 
we have previously incurred substantial net losses 
our ability to operate profitably in the future depends on increasing sales of our services while maintaining sufficient gross profit margins 
we must  among other things 
maintain satisfactory relationships with resellers such as at t  our largest customer  and network equipment manufacturers such as cisco  
renew our two primary agreements with at t beyond the ordering periods that currently expire in june  
establish relationships with additional marketing partners for the resale of our services  
develop software to make our principal existing service  prowatch for wans  as well as other services as they achieve larger volumes  more efficient and economical  
develop and sell other network management services  and 
maintain reliable  uninterrupted service from our network management center hours per day  seven days per week 
our revenues will decline significantly and our business will be adversely affected if at t discontinues  or materially reduces  sales of our services 
sales to at t  which resells our services to its customers  accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal year and of our total revenues in fiscal year we anticipate that sales to at t will continue to comprise a substantial percentage of our revenues in fiscal year  but we believe the percentage will continue to decline 
to the extent we continue to depend on at t for a large portion of our sales  our total revenues will decline materially if at t discontinues selling our services  significantly reduces its sales of our services  or fails to renew our two primary agreements that have ordering periods expiring in june we cannot be sure that we will be successful in reducing our dependence on at t in the future  or that at t will continue to renew its agreements with us 
our agreements with at t are not exclusive arrangements 
we will need to maintain a good working relationship with different business units of at t in order to maintain the business we currently provide to at t s customers and to encourage at t to sell our services to additional customers 
we cannot assure that at t will continue to sell our services to existing or additional at t customers 
a substantial reduction in our at t business from any cause  including those described above  would result in diminished revenues for an extended period of time as we attempted to replace that business 
our quarterly results may fluctuate and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if either our revenues or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall dramatically 
our revenues are difficult to forecast and may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
the market for network management services is relatively new  and we have no reliable means to assess overall customer demand  
we derive a majority of our revenues from at t and other resellers  and our revenues therefore depend significantly on the willingness and ability of at t and those other resellers to sell our services to their customers  
we may not be able to attract additional resellers to market our services as expected  
we expect to continue encouraging end users to purchase equipment and equipment maintenance services from other sources  and we therefore anticipate that our revenues from equipment hardware and maintenance resales will continue to decline as we seek to manage our mix of revenues  
we may not add new end users as rapidly as we expect  
we may lose existing end users as the result of competition  problems with our services or  in the case of end users who are customers of our resellers  problems with the reseller s services or an unwillingness by our resellers to renew their agreements with us  and 
we may not be able to develop new or improved services as rapidly as they are needed 
most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
as a result  variations in the timing of revenues could significantly affect our results of operations from quarter to quarter and could result in quarterly losses 
our future operating results may vary by season  which will make it difficult to predict our future performance 
as a result of seasonal factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
these factors may adversely affect our operating results or cause our operating results to fluctuate  resulting in a decrease in our stock price 
quarterly results of operations should not be relied upon to predict our future performance 
our bookings may be slower during the months of july and august due to the vacation schedules of our resellers sales and marketing employees 
this situation may lead to lower levels of revenues earned during the following fiscal quarter  which ends december our revenues during our third and fourth fiscal quarters may be more volatile and difficult to predict due to the budgeting and purchasing cycles of our end users 
end users often purchase our services at the same time they purchase new network equipment such as routers 
as a result  the timing of their large capital expenditures could affect the timing of their purchases of our services 
some end users may not be able to purchase network equipment and our services near the end of a calendar year due to depleted budgets 
other end users may accelerate purchases in order to use an unspent portion of their budget 
the market for our services is new and evolving rapidly  and our business will be seriously damaged if the market does not develop as we expect 
our long term viability depends significantly upon the acceptance and use of remote network management services 
the market for remote network management services is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
this market environment makes it more difficult to determine the size and growth of the market and to predict how this market will develop 
changes in technology  the availability of qualified information technology professionals and other factors that make internal network management more cost effective than remote network management would adversely affect the market for our services 
our business may be seriously damaged if this market fails to grow  grows more slowly than we expect or develops in some way that is different from our expectations 
we must establish relationships with additional resellers in order to increase our revenues and become consistently profitable 
we expect to rely increasingly on resellers such as telecommunications carriers  internet service providers and data networking value added resellers to market our services 
we must establish these alternative sales channels in order to increase our revenues and become consistently profitable 
we have only recently begun to develop these sales channels  and we have established relationships with only a few resellers 
while we have gained additional experience in managing sales through resellers  we have not yet achieved consistent results from such sales 
except for at t  these resellers have not generated significant sales of our services to date and may not succeed in marketing our services in the future 
our agreements with resellers  including at t  generally do not require that the resellers sell any minimum level of our services and generally do not restrict the resellers development or sale of competitive services 
we cannot be sure that these resellers will dedicate resources or give priority to selling our services 
in addition  resellers may seek to make us reduce the prices for our services in order to lower the total price of their equipment  software or service offerings 
reseller relationships may adversely affect our business by weakening our relationships with end users  decreasing the strength of our brand name and limiting our ability to sell services directly to resellers customers 
our strategy of selling our services primarily through resellers may result in us having weaker relationships with the end users of our services 
this may inhibit our ability to gather customer feedback that helps us improve our services  develop new services and monitor customer satisfaction 
we may also lose brand identification and brand loyalty  since our services may be identified by private label names or may be marketed differently by our resellers 
a failure by any of our resellers to provide their customers with satisfactory products  services or customer support could injure our reputation and seriously damage our business 
our agreements with these resellers may limit our ability to sell our services directly to the resellers customers in the future 
any material decrease in sales of our wan management services will significantly reduce our total revenues and adversely affect our business 
competitive pressures  general declines in the levels of new wide area network  or wan  installations or other factors that adversely affect sales of our wan management services or that cause significant decreases in the prices of our wan management services could significantly limit or reduce our revenues 
sales of our prowatch for wans and similar wan management services accounted for of our recurring network management services revenues in fiscal year likewise  a substantial portion of our nonrecurring network management services and equipment resale revenues depend on the successful sale of these wan management services 
we expect that these wan management services will continue to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our financial performance therefore depends directly on continued market acceptance of our wan management services  as well as our ability to introduce enhanced versions of these services that make these services more efficient and economical 
our failure to develop and sell additional services could impair our financial results and adversely affect our business 
our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop  introduce and sell new and enhanced network management services other than wan management services  including services that 
address the increasingly sophisticated needs of current and prospective end users  and 
respond on a timely and cost effective basis to technological advances and emerging industry standards and protocols 
although we have developed new services  such as network management services for local area networks  or lans network security services and ip telephony  we have not derived significant revenues from these services to date 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful selling these services or developing additional services on time or on budget 
the development of new services is a complex and uncertain process 
the newness of the market for remote network management services makes it difficult to determine whether a market will develop for any particular network management service 
if we succeed in increasing the percentage of our revenues that is derived from resellers  we may have weaker relationships with the end users of our services  making it even more difficult for us to identify services acceptable to our target market 
we cannot assure that future technological or industry developments will be compatible with our business strategy or that we will be successful in responding to these changes in a timely or cost effective manner 
our failure to develop and sell services other than wan management services could seriously damage our business 
our business may be harmed if we lose the services of any member of our management team without appropriate succession and transition arrangements 
our ability to continue to build our business and meet our goals going forward depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our management team  including craig s 
tysdal  our president and chief executive officer 
we do not have employment contracts requiring any of our personnel  including the members of our management team  to continue their employment for any period of time  and we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our personnel  including our executive officers 
the loss of the expertise of any member of our management team without appropriate succession and transition arrangements could seriously damage our business 
in order to support our business  we must hire additional information technology professionals  who are in short supply 
we derive all of our revenues from network management services and related resales of equipment 
these services can be extremely complex  and in general only highly qualified  highly trained information technology  or it  professionals have the skills necessary to develop and provide these services 
in order to continue to support our current and future business  we need to attract  motivate and retain a significant number of qualified it professionals 
qualified it professionals are in short supply  and we face significant competition for these professionals  from not only our competitors but also our end users  marketing partners and other companies throughout the network services industry 
other employers may offer it professionals significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive career paths or geographic locations than we are able to offer 
any failure on our part to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified it professionals would seriously damage our business 
we could incur significant costs if we are unable to retain our information technology professionals 
because of the limited availability of it professionals  we seek to hire persons who have obtained college bachelor s degrees and then train those persons to provide our services 
as a result  we invest a significant amount of time and money in training these new employees before they begin to support our business 
we do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time 
departures of trained employees could limit our ability to generate revenues and would require us to incur additional costs in training new employees 
we currently compete most directly with our customers internal solutions  and we expect increasing competition from other network services companies 
to compete successfully  we must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change  evolving standards and our competitors innovations by continuing to enhance our services  as well as our sales programs and channels 
any pricing pressures  reduced margins or loss of market share resulting from increased competition  or our failure to compete effectively  could seriously damage our business 
we face competition from different sources 
currently  a major source of competition is the internal network administration organizations of our end users and resellers 
these organizations may have developed tools and methodologies to manage their network processes and may be reluctant to adopt applications offered by third parties like us 
if the market for outsourced network management services grows as we expect  we believe this market will become highly competitive 
competition is likely to increase significantly as new network management services companies enter the market and current competitors expand their service and product lines 
many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including 
larger technical staffs  
more established sales channels  
more software development experience  
greater name recognition  and 
substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
if our operations are interrupted  we may lose customers and revenues 
we must be able to operate our network management infrastructure hours a day  days a year without interruption 
if our operations are interrupted  we may lose customers and revenues 
all of our network management services are provided remotely from our network management center  which is located at a single site in austin  texas 
we currently have redundant systems at separate geographic locations 
however  in order to operate without undue risk of interruption  we must guard against 
power outages  fires  tornadoes and other natural disasters at our network management center  
telecommunications failures  
equipment failures or crashes  
security breaches  and 
other potential interruptions 
any interruptions could 
require us to make payments on the contractual performance guarantees we offer our customers  
cause end users to seek damages for losses incurred  
require us to spend more money replacing existing equipment or adding redundant facilities  
damage our reputation for reliable service  
cause existing end users and resellers to cancel our contracts  and 
make it more difficult for us to attract new end users and resellers 
our revenues would decline and our business would be adversely affected if the networking equipment and carrier services we support become obsolete or are otherwise not used by a large part of our target market 
as part of our strategy  we have elected to support only selected providers of networking equipment and carrier services 
for example  we support routers manufactured by com  bay nortel and cisco  but not by other equipment providers 
our services cannot be used by companies with networking equipment and carrier services that we do not support 
our business would be seriously damaged if  in the future  the networking equipment manufacturers and carrier services that we support were not the predominant providers to our target market or if their equipment or services became unavailable or significantly more expensive 
technological advances that make obsolete any of the networking equipment and carrier services that we support  or that offer significant economic or functional advantages over the equipment and services  also could limit or reduce our revenues or could force us to incur significant costs attempting to support other networking equipment and carrier services 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  and we could incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property against infringers or defending claims of infringement made by others 
our business and financial performance depends to a significant degree upon our software and other proprietary technology 
the software industry has experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of software products 
we have only two patents 
the steps we have taken may not be adequate to deter competitors from misappropriating our proprietary information  and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we could be the subject of claims alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify our distribution partners and end users for similar claims made against them 
any infringement claim could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims 
as a result  any infringement claim could seriously damage our business
