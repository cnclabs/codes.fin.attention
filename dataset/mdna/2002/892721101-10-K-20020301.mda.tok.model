we are paid by our clients primarily on a success based model in that we receive a fee for every lead  customer or sale generated for the client 
in addition to our client based revenue  pursuant to an asset acquisition completed in fiscal see note in the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this report we began generating revenue from our products and services eg  costume jewelry and inexpensive gift items and from the sales and rentals for use both on line and off line from profiled data base information generated by such acquisition 
background from our inception in under the name quintel communications  inc through  we generated the bulk of our revenue from database marketing using the traditional media of television  postal mail and telemarketing 
in  we repositioned our database marketing business to the on line media of the web 
applying the direct marketing disciplines honed from our years of operating in the off line media  our management believes it is able to provide significantly enhanced response based results in a more cost efficient and scaleable manner via on line marketing 
in addition  as a result of our direct marketing background  we believe we are able to design on line marketing programs to cost effectively generate traffic and leads for traditional direct marketing media channels  such as inbound and outbound telemarketing and direct mail 
on line marketing we own the free on line lottery  www 
grouplotto 
com  as well as a number of other interactive games  sites and services on the web

grouplotto 
com 
the grouplotto website offers consumers the opportunity to win up to million daily in a free  on line lottery 
the lottery prizes are indemnified by an independent  third party agency 
in order to play  each consumer must provide complete and accurate registration information and agree to receive opt in marketing messages from grouplotto and our marketing partners 
the interactive media on this website includes registration pages  game banners  and pop ups  the purpose of which is to generate web traffic  leads and sales 
revenue is generated at this website from our corporate clients who pay for such traffic  leads and sales 
we generate our bulk consumer traffic to this website through email marketing to lists of consumers who have indicated an interest in our marketing programs by opting in to receive such offers 
similar to the grouplotto website  we generate results for our clients through several other interactive games and products 
for example  we market through a scratch and win game that offers consumers the chance to instantly find out if they have won any number of prizes 
the consumer plays the game by scratching with the mouse certain parts of the entry ticket to uncover the results 
these games can be pushed to consumers by delivering them to the player s email inbox 
we recently launched www 
prizecade 
com  a destination website where consumers have access to parlor  arcade and casino style games 
we intend to use these games to generate revenue from our clients in a similar manner as the grouplotto model 
we believe these games could also offer other new revenue opportunities  such as brand marketing 
email marketing 
one of our most important revenue sources is direct marketing via email 
each program that we market for our clients can be implemented not only through the interactive games and pop ups  but also  and often primarily  through email marketing 
we currently have almost million profiled  permission based records which have been acquired under a number of affinity group based brands 
compared to postal marketing and telemarketing  email marketing is significantly less expensive  offers much faster response times  and  we believe  provides for a more rich consumer media experience 
we now own an email delivery system which reduces our dependence on third party vendors and further reduces the expenses associated with delivering our monthly commercial email messages 
one of the attractive features for clients  and  we believe  a significant competitive advantage  is our ability to create and test a variety of marketing campaigns for prospective and existing corporate clients at no risk to the client 
since we own extensive databases  manage a creative department  and can deliver email at a low cost  we are able to offer prospective and existing clients the opportunity to test market new products  services  price points and creative concepts in order to determine if an on line campaign works for the client and which campaigns work most effectively 
even after campaigns are fully implemented  we further analyze the marketing results to gauge whether the campaigns are continuing to generate adequate results for the client  whether the media is being utilized cost efficiently  and to determine whether new and different copy is yielding better overall results 
these are the traditional direct marketing disciplines which  we believe  when applied together with our proprietary databases  delivery systems and reporting systems  distinguish us from our competitors in the on line marketing industry 
syndication 
after we develop a campaign that works efficiently on our proprietary media  we often syndicate the program to third party media 
typically  we have expended time  media and other costs in developing certain campaigns 
in exchange for this invested effort  we obtain the right to market those campaigns to a list of other on line media companies 
we enter into agreements with these other on line media companies to run the campaigns generally on a fee share arrangement 
we believe these media companies benefit by receiving an immediately marketable  fully packaged and tested marketing program 
as a result  we believe we are able to leverage campaigns we have developed including our proprietary products and services so that we can generate additional revenue with virtually no costs or risks associated with such business extension 
proprietary products and services a revenue stream that has been introduced in fiscal  relates to the on line marketing of our own products and services 
for example  one of our websites  thanksmuch 
com  now sells inexpensive costume jewelry and other gift items directly to consumers 
when a consumer selects a gift item and tenders his credit card  he is given the opportunity to purchase other  more valuable products and services at special discounts 
in addition to the thanksmuch line of jewelry and gifts  we are developing and testing other products and services for direct marketing to consumers 
no assurances can be given  however  that these anticipated sources of revenue will generate any significant income to our operations in future fiscal periods  if at all

disclosure is also required about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
during the fiscal years ended november  and we generated revenue from three segments e commerce  off line customer acquisition and lec billed products 
the e commerce segment realized significant growth during the year fiscal years ended november  and  and currently represents the core of our business operations 
revenue in the e commerce segment is generated primarily from marketing of third party products and services on our websites and through e mail promotions 
the off line customer acquisition segment consists of revenue generated by us through off line direct marketing channels 
historically  this segment s activities were primarily telemarketing

this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  the company s net revenues  on a segmental basis  and with the components of the individual segments  for the fiscal years ended november  and  are set forth in the following tables segment data net revenues  by segment component change inc dec change inc dec year ended november  e commerce components long distance customer acquisitions    grouplotto and other websites    net branch commission fees   email    data sales and rentals   total e commerce    off line customer acquisition services components long distance customer acquisitions    long distance usage commissions   net branch commission fees   other customer acquisition services   total off line customer acquisition services    lec billed products and services components entertainment service royalties    club products    enhanced services  principally voice mail    telephone number list revenue   total lec billed products and services    corporate and other components miscellaneous products  list revenue and other   consolidated net revenues    net revenue increased  or  to  for the year ended november  fiscal when compared to revenues of  in the year ended november  fiscal 
this increase was specifically attributable to the company s e commerce segment  which recognized a net increase in revenue of approximately million  offset by combined declines in net revenue from the company s legacy segments of approximately million 
the e commerce segment revenue increase resulted from the company s increasing focus on generating revenue from its current core business  on line direct marketing 
the company expects this segment to continue to represent a substantial part of the company s revenue in future fiscal periods 
as a percentage of consolidated net revenue  the company s on line direct marketing activities constituted of fiscal revenues  compared to in fiscal the declines in the company s off line customer acquisition services segment decrease of million and lec billed products and services segment decrease of million were attributable to the company s termination of the active marketing of such products and services during prior fiscal periods and the company s intentional migration to the internet for the generation of the bulk of its revenue 
the company s on line revenues are generated on a higher margin basis when compared to such legacy segments operating activities 
this migration commenced at the end of the fiscal year ended november  fiscal and became fully implemented during fiscal during the year ended november   the company executed an on line customer acquisition program for a prominent long distance service provider 
under such arrangement  the company generated approximately million of revenue in fiscal  specifically during the fourth quarter 
this represented and of consolidated net revenues for fiscal and the fourth quarter thereof  respectively 
the company s agreement with such long distance carrier terminated during the first quarter of the fiscal year ending november  fiscal 
although the company has entered into a new agreement with such long distance carrier  the company anticipates that the impact thereof on fiscal periods beyond the first quarter of fiscal will not be material 
the revenue generated in fiscal from the company s original agreement with this long distance carrier  coupled with the on line portion of the talk 
com settlement more fully described below of approximately million  accounted for fiscal s  of long distance customer acquisitions sub segment revenue included in the company s e commerce segment 
this represented a decline in such sub segment of approximately  when compared to fiscal fiscal s e commerce long distance customer acquisition sub segment revenues were entirely attributable to talk 
com customer acquisition activity prior to the october termination of the company s agreement therewith 
the net growth in the company s e commerce segment was primarily attributable to an approximate million increase in revenue generated from the company s e mail marketing programs  as compared to only  of revenues during fiscal this substantial increase of approximately over the prior year was the result of the company generating significantly more on line generated consumer data and a number of on line contracts with new customers during the fiscal year ended november  during the prior year  the company had not significantly penetrated this method of revenue generation 
during the second half of fiscal  the company began the practice of marketing e mail promotional offers to third party databases on a revenue share basis 
the company becomes obligated to pay these third parties only when a transaction occurs and payment is made to the company by the third parties whose promotion was mailed 
these fee share basis revenues provide operating income at a reduced operating margin when compared to e mail promotional offers mailed to the company s proprietary database 
the company reports the fees paid to the owners of the third party databases as a component of selling expenses 
it is the company s intent to limit fiscal s fee share basis expenses to approximately of consolidated revenues  compared to approximately in fiscal the second material factor contributing to the growth of the company s e commerce segment was the approximately million in on line data sales and rentals generated in fiscal when compared to a negligible amount generated in fiscal the company believes it was able to identify itself as a source of valuable permission based data and nurtured relationships with third parties to facilitate the sale and rental of such data 
the third material factor contributing to the growth of the company s e commerce segment was the approximately million or increase in net revenues earned from the grouplotto and other website sub segment 
the grouplotto site has developed increased brand recognition on the internet and has enabled the company s sales force to increase its revenue generating customer base on the site 
during the year ended november   the company was successful in its legal action against talk america  inc talk  resulting in an approximate million arbitration award 
the award represented restitution for long distance customers delivered to talk  and for lost profits suffered by the company due to talk s wrongful termination of an agreement between the parties 
this wrongful termination occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recognized million of revenue of consolidated fiscal revenues  this represented talk s acceptance of such delivered customers  thus fulfilling the company s revenue recognition criteria 
from the settlement during the year ended november   resulting from the receipt of talk s first of two installments due on the total award 
the first installment was comprised of approximately million of revenue attributable to the long distance customer acquisition sub segment of the company s e commerce segment 
the balance of the first installment  or approximately million of revenue  was attributable to the company s off line customer acquisition legacy segment primarily telemarketing 
the company recognized an approximate million contingent telemarketing cost as a result of this settlement 
this contingent cost is discussed in further detail in the following cost of goods sold section 
the second  and final  installment of approximately million  plus interest at  is due on april  if the company receives the second installment in fiscal  it will record the revenue at that time 
the company expects that the segment distribution of such second installment will be as follows a approximately million of e commerce revenue within that segment s long distance customer acquisition sub segment  and b approximately million of off line customer acquisition segment revenue 
based on the telecommunications industry s present weakened state of financial affairs  and specifically management s estimation of talk s ability to pay  management determined that the second installment of the settlement was a gain contingency and  as such  will record any related revenue only upon collection 
during the year ended november   revenues from the company s majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  contributed approximately  or of consolidated net revenues 
the subsidiary generates revenue by operating under net branch agreements  whereby it originates residential mortgages and refinancings for licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies 
the subsidiary became active as a result of reduced mortgage and refinance loan interest rates  and increased government funds for low income homebuyers 
the subsidiary s revenue was generated through on line sources  included in the e commerce segment and through conventional marketing efforts  consisting of outbound telemarketing  direct mail and print media  included in the off line customer acquisition segment 
pursuant to a full year of consolidated operations  and management s anticipation that the interest rate environment will remain stable and beneficial to new homebuyers and people interested in refinancing  the company anticipates that the subsidiary will generate significantly more revenue in the fiscal year ending november  see transactions with major customers and termination of economic dependence  prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods and service bureaus and local exchange carriers following the liquidity and capital resources section for a detailed discussion of other revenue decreases as they relate to the company s comparative and future revenues 
in the fiscal periods prior to november   the company s cost of revenues were offset by net revenue generated from certain premium offerings made in conjunction with the company s marketing of other products and services 
the company terminated the marketing of these products and services in conjunction with the transaction agreements  all as more fully described in prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods 
all such residual revenue from those premium offerings have been reflected in the company s other income expense section 
for the year ended november   such income expense included in other nonoperating income was approximately  compared to approximately  for the prior year

the company s increased focus on generating revenues from direct marketing campaigns delivered on line was the primary factor contributing to this increase 
during the course of the year  the company realized increased costs for e mailing on an absolute basis approximate increase of million over  for fiscal  but recognized decreased costs on a per unit basis for e mail services obtained from third party e mailers 
as of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the price of third party e mail service provision was in the range of 
to per thousand e mails sent 
in prior fiscal periods  the company paid as much as per thousand e mails sent 
this per unit price reduction is the contributing factor that enabled the company to increase e mail related revenue approximately  while recognizing a smaller  increase in e mail and related delivery costs over the comparable prior year 
in december  the company acquired the assets of a canadian based technology company and  with the integration of this entity in fiscal  the company believes it will further reduce the unitary costs of its e mailing promotions 
the company uses the services of an agency for the provision of indemnification coverage in the event the grouplotto site produces a winner in one of its free on line lottery games 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company restructured its lottery game prizes and concurrently reduced the costs of the related premiums for the indemnification coverage 
this premium cost savings was realized in the year ended november  and is reflected by a indemnification cost decrease  compared to a increase in related revenues generated at the grouplotto site 
in october  the company had a million winner on its grouplotto site 
the indemnification agency acknowledged the winner s claim  awarded payment  and the company did not incur any additional expense beyond the premiums 
additionally  the company s premium costs per game did not increase as a result of the winner s claim 
the company s off line customer acquisition segment had been primarily inactive for the first nine months of fiscal during the fourth quarter  the company received the first of the two scheduled installments from the talk arbitration victory and recorded a portion of the revenue in the off line customer acquisition segment 
pursuant to the receipt of the first installment in november  the company recorded its obligation to make an approximate million contingent payment to a telemarketing vendor for their services performed for the company relating to marketing for talk 
the company does not have any other contingent liabilities related to the second  and final  settlement installment that is scheduled for receipt in april in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company released approximately  in excess premium accruals from terminated off line customer acquisition marketing programs

on a segmental basis  the company s e commerce segment gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the percentage point increase resulted from a the company benefiting from the cost free revenue generating effect of databases purchased in the fiscal year ended november  the databases were fully expensed in fiscal and the company owns and continues to use these databases in fiscal without additional cost  b decreased costs on a unitary basis associated with the company s e mailing activities  and c a significant decline in the company s free on line lottery prize indemnification costs 
the company s off line customer acquisition services segment s gross margin declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the percentage point decline resulted from the costs of a contingent liability realized upon the settlement of the arbitration dispute with talk 
the contingency was of a higher cost relationship to revenues than historically recognized within the segment  due to the fact that the total contingency became payable as a result of the first installment 
the second installment will not have any contingent payables if such second installment is collected in fiscal to the extent that the balance of the talk settlement is received in fiscal  the company will report gross margin in its off line customer acquisition segment in excess of

regarding the increase in fee share commissions  in the second half of fiscal  the company significantly expanded the practice of marketing promotional offers on behalf of its marketing clients clients to third party databases on a fee share commission basis 
the fee share commission relationship generally arises after the company concludes a contractual arrangement with a client pursuant to which the company modifies or develops the copy  offer form and promotional materials for the client s product or service 
the company then tests the promotion  and agrees to deliver a minimum level of new customers  and or targeted leads to the client 
simultaneously with the execution of these contractual arrangements  the company obtains the exclusive rights from the client to market their promotions to a list of third parties with whom the company has marketing relationships the third parties

the terms of these agreements generally provide that the third party has the right to i approve the creative materials for each promotion  ii approve the timing of each promotion s mailing  iii terminate the contract on short notice  and iv reject any promotion for any reason 
each agreement sets forth the terms of the third party s compensation  which range from fixed fees paid for each customer or lead  generated for the client  to a revenue share that is a percentage of the revenue generated after deduction for certain direct costs by the company for marketing that offer to the third party database 
the company utilizes unique universal resource locater identifier links urls when promotions are mailed to the third party database

the majority of the approximate million e commerce segment net revenue generated during the fiscal year ended november   when compared to the  of net revenue generated during the fiscal year ended november   is attributable to marketing sale agreements with marketing partners and corporate customers

for a more detailed discussion of the decrease in off line customer acquisition services segment revenues see transactions with major customers 
the decline in the lec billed products and services segment was primarily due to the residual effects of the company s termination of the active marketing of such services in november see service bureaus and local exchange carriers and prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods for an expanded discussion of such decrease 
additionally  decreases in net revenues from the lec billed products and services segment were partially offset by adjustments to chargeback estimates from prior fiscal periods 
due to the fact that a significant portion of these previously offered lec segment services have reached their contractual settlement phase  it was determined that certain chargeback reserves were no longer necessary  and approximately million was credited to income for the year ended november  the company s cost of sales are comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs directly associated with the procurement and retention of customers  including direct response advertising costs  marketing partner profit participation costs  promotional costs and premium fulfillment costs  and the related billing  collection and customer service costs 
during the year ended november   the company s cost of revenues were offset by net revenue generated from certain premium offerings made in conjunction with the company s marketing of other products and services 
the company terminated the marketing of these products and service in conjunction with the transaction agreements more fully described in prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods 
all such residual revenues from those premium offerings are reflected in the company s other income expense section  as a component of other non operating income  and amounted to approximately million for the year ended november  the company s cost of sales for the years ended november  and are presented below segment data cost of sales cost of sales change inc dec change inc dec year ended november  e commerce    off line customer acquisition services    lec billed products and services    corporate and other   consolidated totals    consolidated cost of sales  by component cost of sales change inc change inc dec dec year ended november  advertising  promotion and fulfillment costs    service bureau fees  including customer service and psychic operators    pay per call premium net revenue   total    the decrease in cost of sales is directly attributable to the company s significantly reduced marketing efforts and related expenditures for the year ended november   when compared to the year ended november  the primary factor contributing to this reduction was the termination of the marketing of the residential long distance customer acquisition activities with qwest 
this termination was effective november   and  therefore  the year ended november  did not include the cost of revenues regarding this arrangement 
this agreement was active during the entire year ended november  and caused the company to incur all of the attendant costs of revenue  such as outbound telemarketing  direct mail  television broadcast media  fulfillment costs and customer service 
see transactions with major customers 
the advertising  promotion and fulfillment decreases associated with the qwest agreement termination were partially offset by increases in customer acquisition costs in obtaining registered users for its websites and the costs associated with acquiring long distance customers  both on line and off line  for the company s customer acquisition agreement with talk 
com 
the talk 
com agreement  initially entered into in may  and then replaced by a long term contract in september  was terminated by talk 
com on october  see transactions with major customers  which termination the company is contesting in arbitration see legal proceedings 
the decrease in cost of revenues is also attributable to the significant decrease in service bureaus fees during the year ended november  of approximately million  or  when compared to the year ended november  the primary factor contributing to this decrease in service bureau fees relates to the decrease in the company s lec segment products and services billed during the year ended november   when compared to the year ended november   with net revenues generated from the offering of such products and services subject to service bureau fees having decreased approximately 
the billing of these lec products and services generated a bill delivery costs  b post billing and collection management costs and c data maintenance costs  with the majority of those costs being invoiced as a percentage of the related gross revenue billed 
during the year ended november   the cost of revenue was also reduced for adjustments made to prior period fulfillment liability estimates 
the adjustments reduced prior year estimates to amounts actually redeemed 
the total amount of these reductions to cost of sales approximated  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a are principally comprised of a compensation costs and related expenses for executive  sales  finance  information systems and general administration personnel  b professional fees  c insurance costs  d occupancy and other equipment rental costs  e site development and modification costs related to the company s e commerce segment  and f all other general and miscellaneous corporate expense items

during the year ended november  the company expended approximately million on website development  hosting  enhancements  maintenance  and consulting fees 
the company also expended approximately million on contingent prize based insurance to cover the possibility of winners of its free on line lottery website 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in personnel utilized in maintaining the company s legacy businesses 
such decreases were principally recognized during the first six months of the fiscal year ended november  the legacy business personnel cost reductions were partially offset by increases in human resources and development costs associated with the company s e commerce segment 
additional reductions in sg a are attributable to the terms of an agreement entered into by the company in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended november   pursuant to which the company i eliminated its media buying operation  which included a staff of approximately twenty one employees  ii was released from a continuing rent expense obligation under an assignment of a lease for the office space occupied by such media department  and iii disposed of all the media operation s property and equipment

the company s effective income tax rate was and for the years ended november  and  respectively  and is a result of the combination of federal income taxes at statutory rates and state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s financial and liquidity position maintained its strength in the face of the current internet and technology sector weakness and global economic downturn  as exhibited by the company s cash  cash equivalent and short term marketable securities balance of approximately million at november  cash  cash equivalent and short term marketable securities were approximately million at november  on a comparative basis  the company s working capital remained stable between november  and  at approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company s cash flows from the excess of marketable securities maturities  and sales over marketable securities purchases  were primarily used to fund repurchases of our common stock  fund our investment in working capital and fund our capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  during fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal the significant components resulting in this decrease were a decline in net income  increases in accounts receivable generated by the company s e commerce segment  and decreases in income tax and related party payables  partially offset by noncash impairment charges and the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses 
on march   the company made a million partial payment against a tentative settlement with the internal revenue service irs based upon the current status of tax audits covering the tax years january  to december  this payment and other payments referenced below were factored into the company s tax accrual and corresponding earnings in prior fiscal years 
therefore  the company does not expect to recognize a future impact on earnings for these payments 
the march payment was made to reduce the company s interest expense related to the final settlement  which was accepted by the internal revenue service irs in august  pending irs joint committee review based on the fact that one of the tax years in the tax period under audit had generated a refund in excess of million due to a tax basis net operating loss carryback 
in september  the company expended million as an additional installment against the settlement of the tax audits 
a final disbursement of approximately  will be made upon the irs s issuance of a final statement of interest expense due on the matter 
it is expected that the irs s final statement will be received  either late in the second quarter or in the third quarter of fiscal  with payment being made upon receipt 
trade accounts receivable as a percentage of net revenues increased to at november   from at november  the primary reason for the increase is attributable to an increase in the aggregate number of days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable when comparing the full fiscal year ended november  with for the fiscal year ended november   the company s dso on a quarterly basis were as follows first quarter days  second quarter days  third quarter days  fourth quarter days  aggregate annual dso days 
the majority of the company s customers are extended day credit terms 
the company continually monitors customer adherence to such terms and constantly strives to improve the effectiveness of its collection efforts with the goal of achieving a dso in the day range 
future fiscal year quarters might not reflect this goal of a day dso  or the day dso recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the year ended november   approximately million of net cash was provided by investing activities  resulting from approximately million provided by net proceeds from the sale of investments in short term  high grade commercial paper  auction rate securities and marketable securities  offset by cash outflows for capital expenditures of approximately  and long term investments of  the company invests its excess cash in short term investments predicated on operating cash requirements  capital expenditure plans and other business needs 
to date  the company has not been required to supplement its internally generated cash with third party financing or borrowings 
cash used in financing activities during the year ended november  amounted to  included in the use of financing funds was a a million purchase and retirement of common stock acquired from a former director and officer  and b  in open market purchases of the company s stock  held in treasury  with both of these being offset by  in proceeds generated by the exercise of the company s stock options 
historically  the company s primary cash requirements have been used to fund the cost of advertising and promotion  with additional funds having been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines and further development of businesses being test marketed 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company executed its on line direct marketing strategy 
the company s future plans and business strategy continue to call for its internet based e commerce segment to be its primary operating focus  with such segment generating a material portion of future revenues 
if the company s on line activities fail to generate sufficient revenue  then the continuation of the company s on line growth could have a material adverse impact on the company s capital and liquidity resources relating to possible expenditures for a marketing campaigns  b product development costs  c site development and maintenance and related technology based costs  d potential on line business acquisitions  e costs associated with developing alternative means of e mail promotion delivery  or f other unexpected and or currently unidentifiable costs 
during the year ended november   the company expended approximately  in capital expenditures to support its e commerce activities 
in december  the company acquired the assets of a canadian based internet technology company 
the company believes that this acquisition will decrease certain costs relative to its reliance on third parties in the provision of e mailing services and other internet hosting services 
the realization of those proposed cost savings will require capital expenditures on behalf of the company 
should the business climate  internet operating environment or technology environment change significantly  the company could be faced with circumstances that would limit or prevent its utilization of these capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company s internet business plan and strategy prompted the company to terminate the active marketing of its legacy products and services 
accordingly  this legacy activity may contribute  but in a significantly decreasing degree  to the company s cash flows and net income in subsequent fiscal periods  as was the case during the year ended november  when compared to the years ended november  and this should be considered when using the company s historical results in evaluating future operations  cash flows and financial position 
nevertheless  the company will continue to explore opportunities to offer other off line customer acquisition services and lec billed products and services in the future 
under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions  management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company does not have any material long term obligations other than those described in note commitments and contingent liabilities included in the company s financial statements included in part iv of this document  nor has the company identified any long term obligations that it contemplates incurring in the near future 
as the company seeks to further extend its reach into the e commerce arena  as well as identify new and other consumer oriented products and services in the off line arena  the company may use existing cash reserves  long term financing  or other means to finance such diversification 
prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods in june  the company entered into certain agreements the transaction agreements  including the agreement regarding pay per call psychic services the agreement  dated as of may   by and between the company and ars access resource services  inc  pursuant to which the company agreed to refrain until january  from conducting  marketing  advertising or promoting certain stand alone pay per call psychic services described in the agreement the psychic services directly or indirectly through any affiliate 
in addition  the company agreed to cease the conduct of the media buying operation which it conducted under the name quintel media and ars agreed to assume responsibility for the quintel media employees and for the lease of the premises used by quintel media in fort lauderdale  florida  and to acquire the computer equipment and other furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements used by quintel media at such premises 
in consideration for the company s acceptance of the terms of the agreement  ars and any of its affiliates offering pay per call psychic services and or membership club services  agreed to pay to the company certain royalty fees entertainment service termination royalties  included in the company s lec billed products and services segment relative to such service offerings 
ars was required to pay such royalty fees from and after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreements  and until january  for the years ended november   and  these royalties amounted to approximately   and  or  and  respectively  of the company s related net revenues 
as of november   the company has received all funds due under this arrangement and will no longer recognize revenue or cash flows from this activity in future fiscal periods 
transactions with major customers during the fiscal year ended november   the company had six major customers  five within its e commerce segment and one within its off line customer acquisition services segment  which  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of consolidated net revenues during the year ended november   and approximately of consolidated trade accounts receivable net as of november  the company did not conduct business with the five e commerce segment customers referenced above in fiscal during the fiscal year ended november   the company derived approximately of net revenues from two major customers in its off line customer acquisition services segment as discussed below 
in the year ended november   the company had derived approximately of its revenue from one major customer 
as at november   the company had either terminated  or had been terminated  from providing services to such major customers 
accounts receivable from fiscal s major customers were approximately and  at november  and  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company generated its off line customer acquisition revenue exclusively from long distance customer acquisition agreements with two long distance providers  qwest communications and talk 
com 
the company provided marketing services to the long distance carrier lci international telecom corp  d b a qwest communications services qwest during that time  primarily through outbound telemarketing and broadcast media  directed at the acquisition of residential long distance customers for qwest 
in addition to commissions paid to the company for its successful customer acquisitions on behalf of qwest  the company also received a portion of qwest s net revenues earned from such acquired customers residential long distance usage 
this marketing arrangement with qwest was terminated in fiscal through the execution of settlement  termination and release agreements 
the company does not expect to receive any further revenue from qwest relative to these agreements 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company entered into a series of agreements with talk 
com holding corp 
talk  pursuant to which the company provided marketing services to talk directed at the acquisition of residential long distance customers for talk 
such agreements obligated talk to pay the company fees for its successful customer acquisitions on behalf of talk 
in october  talk terminated its agreements with the company 
in response to talk s action the company had commenced legal proceedings  via arbitration  to contest what it believed to be talk s wrongful termination of its agreements with the company 
the efforts of the company s general counsel secured a victory against talk resulting in an approximate million arbitration award 
the award represented the settlement for long distance customers delivered to talk approximately million which represented talk s acceptance of such delivered customers thus fulfilling the company s revenue recognition criteria 
the company recognized million of revenue of consolidated fiscal revenues from the settlement during the year ended november   resulting from the receipt of talk s first of two installments due on the total settlement 
talk is included above as one of the company s major customers in fiscal the first installment was comprised of approximately million of revenue attributable to the company s e commerce segment s acquired long distance customers 
the balance of the first installment  or approximately million of revenue  was attributable to the company s off line customer acquisition legacy segment 
the additional portion of the award was approximately million pursuant to the contract s early termination penalty being invoked 
this second  and final  installment of approximately million  plus interest at  is required to be paid on april  if the company receives the second installment in fiscal it will record the revenue at that time  with the segment distribution thereof to be as follows a approximately million of e commerce revenue within that segment s long distance customer acquisition sub segment  and b approximately million of off line customer acquisition segment revenue 
based on the telecommunication industry s present weakened state of financial affairs  and specifically management s estimation of talk s ability to pay  management determined that the second installment of the settlement was a gain contingency and  as such  will record any related revenue only upon collection 
service bureaus  local exchange carriers  and service bureau bankruptcy in november  three of the existing lecs at that time  specifically ameritech corp  bell atlantic corp 
and sbc communications  inc  refused to bill customers for enhanced services provided by the company 
this was a result of what the lecs claimed was excessive complaints by customers for cramming unauthorized charges billed to a customer s phone bill against the company and its affiliates 
this billing cessation effectively prevented the company from selling its enhanced services in those areas serviced by such lecs 
as a result of such lec imposed billing cessation  in november  the primary billing service provider for the company s enhanced services  billing information concepts corporation bic  terminated its arrangement with the company for providing billing for the company s enhanced services 
bic continued to service all data relating to post billing adjustments to records billed prior to bic s self imposed billing cessation 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with federal transtel ftt  whereby ftt provided the billing services previously provided by bic 
in effect  between the termination of the bic billing service arrangement and the commencement of billing under the agreement with ftt approximately two months  the company was unable to bill for any enhanced services provided during such prior fiscal year ended november the company continued to bill an attriting customer base relative to these enhanced services through ftt  until october resulting in net revenues of approximately  and  for the years ended november  and  respectively 
this billing activity was terminated in october resulting from an action brought by the company against ftt  filed in the united states district court  southern district of new york  entitled traffix  inc f k a quintel entertainment  inc v

 the company sought to recover approximately million the company believed were wrongfully withheld by ftt in connection with ftt s billing and collection services for a membership club that the company ceased operating in june the company has been granted summary judgment on liability  and a hearing to determine the exact amount of damages to be awarded to the company was held in october the damages and interest determined at such hearing exceed million 
at november   the company has not recorded a receivable associated with this related action 
the company had charged such amounts involved in the proceeding against net revenues in the year ended november  therefore  the company is treating this action as a gain contingency  with any potential recovery received by the company being reflected as a recovery of bad debt at the time of receipt  subject to the conclusion of the ftt bankruptcy proceedings

critical accounting policy and accounting estimate discussion in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s the commission release nos 
  and fr issued in december  referencing the commission s statement regarding the selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices  the company has set forth below what it believes to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows  if general business conditions  or individual customer financial circumstances  change in an adverse way relative to the policies and estimates used in the attached financial statements or in any forward looking statements contained herewith 
factors that could effect future results revenue recognition  variable costs and bad debts the company currently earns the largest portion of its revenue from the e commerce segment pursuant to marketing agreements with marketing partners and corporate customers collectively  corporate customers 
the provisions of each agreement determine the type and timing of revenue to be recorded 
the company invoices its customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement  and the related marketing activity delivered and or marketing service provided 
revenue is recognized at the time the marketing activity is delivered  or service is provided normally  either daily or weekly  net of estimated contractually specified data qualification allowances  when applicable 
such data qualification allowances provide for reductions to the final amounts paid by the corporate customer  and typically consist of allowances for duplicate records delivered  invalid address records delivered  age restricted records delivered and other contractually determined reductions to the gross records delivered 
the company s revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if the company s actual allowances vary from amounts previously estimated 
historically  the variance between actual allowances and previously estimated allowances has been immaterial 
if events were to occur that would cause the company s actual allowances which are recorded as offsets against gross revenue  as contra revenues  in arriving at reported net revenue to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements  the company could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
certain obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
they include costs payable to other on line  as well as off line  advertisers for registered user acquisitions and consumer data  fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements  e mail message delivery costs  contingent based prize indemnification coverage for potential free on line lottery winners  premium fulfillment costs related to the promotion and all other variable costs directly associated with completing the company s obligations relative to the revenue recognized 
should the internet operating landscape affecting the company adversely change resulting in a higher costs of acquiring consumer data and registered users for the company s websites  b higher costs of acquiring data for our marketing partners  compromising such marketing partners ability to maintain adequate databases to allow for continued third party database use agreements  c the company s fiscal asset acquisition failing to reduce the cost of the company s e mail delivery activities  or the company being required to depend on third party e mailing service bureaus to provide an increased portion of its commercial e mail delivery at a cost in excess of anticipated internally generated costs  d the company s contingent based prize indemnification premiums for indemnification coverage increasing due to an increase in the number of prize winners at the site  or other currently unknown factors  e the company s accruals for fulfillment obligations arising out of its promotions proving to be less than the actual redemptions processed in subsequent fiscal periods  or f unpredictable technology changes or commercial technology applications  then  if any one  or a combination  of the above factors were to materialize in subsequent fiscal periods  the company could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
revenue recognition is also subject to provisions based on the probability of collection of the related trade accounts receivable 
we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results  financial condition  or bankruptcy filings  of our customers 
as a result of this review process  we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related receivables carrying amount to an estimated realizable value 
provisions for bad debts are also recorded due to the review of other factors  including a the length of time the receivables are past due  b historical experience  and c other factors obtained during the conduct of collection efforts 
if circumstances change regarding our specific customers on an individual basis  or if demand for internet direct marketing softens  or if a continuation of the current global economic downturn prevails  our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased  which could adversely affect our operating margins  our profitability and our cash flows 
continuation of major customers and prospects of majority owned subsidiary during the fiscal year ended november   the company derived approximately million  or of its revenues  from six major customers 
three of such customers each exceeded of net revenues  with the remaining three each accounting for of net revenues 
five of the six customers continued to conduct business with the company at november  should the company not be able to continue its relationships with these companies on equivalent  or similarly favorable terms  or replace any of these companies with other third parties on similar revenue and gross margin generating terms  the company could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows would be adversely affected 
our potential decreased profitability relative to such possible failure to continue current relationships  or our inability to replace them with new relationships  could be partially mitigated by the execution of reductions in our workforce 
it is not known how rapidly the company could respond with such reductions  if at all 
during the year ended november   the company s majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  contributed approximately  or of consolidated net revenues 
the subsidiary became active in fiscal in the company s fourth quarter 
the subsidiary generates revenue by operating under net branch agreements  whereby it originates residential mortgages and refinancings for licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies 
the subsidiary became active as a result of reduced mortgage and refinance loan interest rates  and increased government funds for low income homebuyers 
the company s future business plans and operating assumptions anticipate that the subsidiary will contribute significantly more revenue to the company in terms of absolute dollars  and in terms of percentage of total revenues and operating income  in the fiscal year ending november  such assumptions are subject to the continuation of the current interest rate market  the continued acceptance by the general public of off line and on line marketing promotions for mortgage and mortgage related products  the continued ability of the independently operated majority owned subsidiary to hire and maintain competent staff and management personnel  trained in the specific field of net branch operations  as well as other factors currently not identifiable 
the company can make no assurance that it will realize an increased contribution of revenue and related profits from the majority owned subsidiary in future fiscal periods 
the company s revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied our revenues  cost of providing revenues  profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among segments 
the revenue allocation among our segments in future periods will most probably be different than our current revenue allocation due to several factors  including consumer tastes and potential regulatory issues that may exist in future periods 
therefore  it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends 
actual trends may cause the company to adjust its operating emphasis  which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
historically  the company has had to react to rapid changes in the business environment within which it operates 
management responded to these rapid changes as deemed appropriate and as dictated by the nature of such changes 
management s reaction to such changes covered a broad range of business related adjustments  ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions  to entire business model overhauls 
based on the company s current operations and marketing methods  as well as the still emerging status of the internet marketing environment  it is possible that management could institute significant changes to the company s business model in response to unforeseen rapid changes in future fiscal periods 
impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and investment portfolios could impact net income the company carries goodwill and other intangibles on its balance sheet arising from a current year acquisition of the minority interest of a previously majority owned subsidiary 
if the cash flows generated from such subsidiary should fall to levels that are less than the applicable amortization expense resulting from the goodwill recorded on the purchase  then the company will be required to recognize an impairment charge on such goodwill necessary to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its net realizable value 
should events occur that would give rise to such impairment charge  the company would recognize decreased profitability to the extent of such adjustment 
cash flows would not be directly affected by the impairment charge  but cash flows would  most likely  be adversely affected as a result of the facts and circumstances that created the impairment charge 
the company maintains an investment portfolio that is managed by a prominent financial institution 
the portfolio includes high grade corporate commercial paper and auction rate securities  and equity securities of real estate investment trusts reits  all of which are held for varying periods of time  pursuant to maturity dates  market conditions and other factors 
the values of our investments in publicly traded companies  which as of november  was limited to our reit investments  are subject to significant market price volatility 
moreover  due to the economic downturn and difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies in which we have investments  our investment portfolio could be further impaired by the failure of such companies in fulfilling their responsibility of adhering to the repayment of principal upon maturity 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  once sfas is adopted  which will be in our fiscal year ending november   however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment subsequent to adoption 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the standard also establishes specific guidance for testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for our fiscal year ending november   earlier adoption is not available pursuant to the terms of sfas however  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  are subject immediately to the non amortization provisions of sfas while we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations  our preliminary assessment is that the adoption of sfas will have an immaterial impact on the company 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for the disposition of long lived assets 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
the standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for our fiscal year ending november  and will be applied prospectively 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
based on the relative components of our balance sheet at november   we believe that the adoption of sfas will have an immaterial impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations  if any effect at all
