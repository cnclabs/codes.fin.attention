item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationships to net sales of the listed items included in our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended weeks weeks weeks net sales  excluding sales licensed departments cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses license fees from affiliates and other operating income operating loss profit interest expense  net equity in loss income of joint venture loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies  litigation and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial techniques 
the company constantly re evaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgement  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventory 
our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
this is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
it is recognized that the use of this method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the calculation are certain significant management judgements and estimates including  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that this method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures 
additionally  these significant estimates may change as a result of further markdowns based on our sales performance 
reserves to value inventory at the lower of cost or market were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce the carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write down of capitalized development and software costs related to discontinued information systems and a goodwill write down of million relating to a previous acquisition 
effective february   the beginning of the new fiscal year  sfas will be adopted 
sfas requires that goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual fair value based impairment tests 
in addition  a transitional impairment test is required upon the adoption date 
these impairment tests are conducted on each business of the company where goodwill is recorded  and may require two steps 
the initial step is designed to identify potential goodwill impairment by comparing an estimate of the fair value for each applicable business to its respective carrying value 
for those businesses where the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
we are in the process of determining if existing goodwill is impaired 
goodwill impairment  if any  will be recognized in accordance with sfas and will be classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
these estimates are based on actuarial assumptions and are subject to change based on actual results 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
during fiscal  and  we recorded charges of million  million and  respectively  for self insurance liabilities associated with employee health and welfare plans  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs

seasonality our business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail businesses

fiscal year the company follows a week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to january fiscal and contain weeks and fiscal has weeks 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was versus for fiscal adoption of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues statements of financial accounting standards sfas  some of which require implementation by a date falling within or after the close of our fiscal year 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for de rivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
our adoption of sfas effective february  did not have a significant impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risks on borrowings under the million variable rate credit agreement 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments that are held or issued and accounted for as hedges of anticipated transactions 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the guidance in sfas no 
supersedes apb and is applicable to business combinations initiated after june  upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill will cease to be amortized and will instead be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment as set forth in the new standard 
we have approximately million in goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  amortization of the goodwill is generally not deductible for tax purposes 
we recorded approximately million in amortization expense related to goodwill for the twelve months ended february  and we intend to adopt sfas no 
for the fiscal year 
we are in the process of determining if existing goodwill is impaired 
goodwill impairment  if any  will be recognized in accordance with sfas no 
and will be classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addressed financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
under this statement  obligations that meet the definition of a liability will be recognized consistently with the retirement of the associated tangible long lived assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
because sfas no 
did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under opinion  two accounting models existed for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the fasb decided to establish a single accounting model  based on the framework established in statement  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
and at this time  we have not yet determined the effect of these pronouncements on our results of operations and financial position 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation  if any  on the results of operations and financial condition has been minor 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
current ratios at those dates were and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal net cash used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was million versus a loss of million last year 
net cash used for capital expenditures was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  capital expenditures included million for new stores  million for improvements in existing stores  million for relocation of office  warehousing and operations of our shoe business  million for mis equipment upgrades and new systems 
all other capital expenditures aggregated million 
proceeds from lease incentives totaled million in fiscal and are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the lease 
at february   we had a million amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement  dated as of march  the credit agreement  which expires on march   provides for revolving and overnight loans and issuance of letters of credit 
outstanding advances are secured by a lien on assets and are subject to a monthly borrowing base of eligible inventories and receivables  as defined 
terms of the credit agreement require compliance with certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on dividends  the incurrence of additional debt and financial ratio tests 
at february   million was available under the credit agreement 
borrowings aggregated million  plus million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding 
the credit agreement provides for various borrowing rates  currently equal to basis points over libor 
the libor rate on million has been locked in at a fixed annual rate of through april under a swap agreement 
to supplement operating cash requirements  we have a million subordinated secured credit facility with ssc 
outstanding advances under the agreement are subordinated to the credit agreement and are subject to a junior lien on assets securing the credit agreement 
at february   million was outstanding 
the interest rate and terms of the million facility are generally the same as the credit agreement 
we entered a million senior subordinated convertible loan agreement senior facility  dated as of march  the senior facility bears interest at various rates  currently equal to basis points over libor 
the interest rate increases an additional basis points every days after the first anniversary date 
the senior facility is due in september in december  pursuant to terms of the senior facility  ssc purchased the outstanding balance under the same continuing terms 
the terms provide that if prior to february   the balance outstanding thereunder is not repaid from the proceeds of an equity offering or other subordinated debt acceptable to lenders under the credit agreement  then after that date ssc  as the lender  has the right to convert the debt into our common stock at a price equal to of the day average of high and low sales prices reported on the new york stock exchange at the time of conversion 
a one time fee of basis points  or million  was paid to ssc at the initial closing in consideration for entering into a put agreement associated with the senior facility 
achievement of expected cash flows from operations and compliance with our credit agreement covenants see note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon a number of factors  including the attainment of sales  gross profit  expense levels  vendor relations  and flow of merchandise that are consistent with our financial projections 
in the first quarter of fiscal  a major factor organization reduced our availability of credit and indicated that we needed to strengthen our liquidity and increase our credit availability from other sources 
future limitations of credit availability by factor organizations and or vendors will restrict our ability to obtain merchandise and services and may impair operating results 
although operating results for fiscal were below plan  we believe that cash generated by operations  along with the available proceeds from our credit agreement  ssc facility and other sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our obligations for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to meet our projections 
further  there is no assurance that extended financing will be available to us in the future if we fail to meet our projections or on terms acceptable to us 
acquisitions effective with the close of business on february  by acquisition of our partner s interest in vcm for  we now own of vcm and operate the health and beauty care  toy  sporting goods and food departments in the value city stores 
on march   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  base acquisition corp  completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of filene s basement corp  a massachusetts corporation  and filene s basement  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of filene s basement corp 
pursuant to the closing of the asset purchase agreement  dated february  the purchase price included cash of million paid at closing  million to be paid over a period not to exceed three years   shares of our common stock with an agreed value of million and the assumption of specified liabilities 
the assumed liabilities included the payment of amounts outstanding under filene s basement debtor in possession financing facility of approximately million and certain trade payable and other obligations which will be paid in the ordinary course 
allocation of the purchase price has been determined based on fair market valuation of the net assets acquired subject to resolution of several outstanding matters 
these acquisitions were funded by cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds from the credit agreement 
risk factors the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statements decline in demand for our merchandise  the ability to repay the million senior facility through an equity offering or refinancing  our ability to attain our fiscal business plan  expected cash from operations  vendor and their factor relations  flow of merchandise  compliance with the credit agreement  our ability to strengthen our liquidity and increase our credit availability  the availability of desirable store locations on suitable terms  changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  changes in weather patterns  changes in existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas  paper and printing costs  and the ability to hire and train associates 
historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a disproportionate amount of sales and a majority of net income occurring in the back to school and christmas selling seasons 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during this period  including adverse weather  the timing and level of markdowns or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at february   direct borrowings aggregated million 
the credit agreement  as amended and restated effective march   permits debt commitments up to million  has a march  maturity date and generally bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements to effectively establish long term fixed rates on borrowings under the credit agreement  thus reducing a portion of our interest rate risk 
these swap agreements  which are designated as cash flow hedges  involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements 
at february   we had outstanding swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million  for which the interest rate has been locked at a fixed rate of until april at february   we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming an average outstanding principal amount of million subject to variable interest rates 
a increase in libor would result in approximately million of additional interest expense annually
