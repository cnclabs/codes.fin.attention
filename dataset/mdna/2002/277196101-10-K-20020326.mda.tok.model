item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist the reader in evaluating and understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of eastern virginia bankshares  inc and subsidiaries the corporation 
the following analysis provides information about the major components of the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of eastern virginia bankshares evb and attempts to identify trends and material changes that occurred during the reporting periods 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview eastern virginia bankshares evb reported a decrease in net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  as it focused on long term strategic initiatives and increased its loan loss provision by over million in recognition of a deteriorating economy and an increase in nonperforming loans 
the company opened new branch offices in kilmarnock  hanover air park and ashland during the year and relocated its corporate office in tappahannock 
additionally the corporation s net interest margin decreased basis points to from the year margin of 
results of operations net income decreased in to million from million in and million in earnings per share decreased to  compared to and for and  respectively 
the decrease in net income in was the result of a million increase in loan loss provision  startup costs for three new branches and a one time expense for supplemental retirement benefits 
profitability  as measured by evb s return on average equity was  a decrease from s 
return on average assets was  a decrease from the prior year s 
the corporation repurchased thousand shares of its common stock in under a share repurchase program announced by the board in january  the repurchase plan is intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  declined to in  as compared to in and in however  changes in volume exceeded changes in rates  generating an additional million of net interest income in and thousand in the corporation experienced record loan and deposit growth in  with particularly strong results in the fourth quarter 
deposits grew million or while loans increased by million or 
average loans outstanding for the year increased from the average 
residential real estate mortgages outstanding increased from the prior year end while all other areas of the portfolio experienced double digit growth rates 
evb s efficiency ratio  a measure of performance based upon the relationship between noninterest expense and income net of securities gains and losses  continues to compare favorably to other virginia financial institutions 
the corporation s efficiency ratio for declined to compared to s 
a lower efficiency ratio represents greater control of noninterest costs 
fluctuation in the efficiency ratio can be attributed to relative changes in both noninterest income and net interest income as well as noninterest expense 
evb s decline in efficiency ratio was impacted by both the decrease in net interest margin and the noninterest expense increases related to the new branch office startups and the one time employee retirement supplement 
evb is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations

for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax equivalent securities income is further adjusted by the tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents the corporation s net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

interest sensitivity evb s primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
the corporation generally strives to maintain a position flexible enough to move to an equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs  maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
noninterest income noninterest income increased by thousand from million in to million in service charges on deposit accounts  the largest source of noninterest income  increased thousand from million in to million in other operating income increased thousand from thousand in to thousand in  primarily the result of thousand income on a title company investment  and thousand investment services income

note to the consolidated financial statements provides a reconciliation between the amount of income tax expense computed using the federal statutory income tax rate and evb s actual income tax expense 
also included in note to the consolidated financial statements is information regarding deferred taxes for and loan portfolio loans  net of unearned income  increased to million at december   up million or from million at year end the corporation experienced particularly strong loan growth in the fourth quarter of  and has seen that trend continue in the early weeks of loan growth in was spread among the various loan categories with the real estate portfolio growing million or  commercial loans million or and consumer loans net of unearned discount million or 
primary contributors to increased loan growth were the addition of new branch offices in lancaster and hanover counties 
at year end  loans  net of unearned income were million  up million or from million at year end the corporation experienced strong loan growth throughout  continuing a trend that started in the fourth quarter of loan growth in was spread among the various loan categories with the real estate portfolio growing million or  consumer loans net of unearned discount million or  and commercial loans million or 
with the increasing rate environment of  real estate lending growth moderated from s while consumer loan demand increased

residential real estate mortgages made up of the loan portfolio as compared to at year end and at year end the corporation attempts to limit its exposure to the risk of local real estate markets by controlling the size of its commercial real estate loan portfolio  and by focusing on real estate loans secured by owner occupied properties 
commercial real estate loans increased from of the total loan portfolio at year end to at year end 
real estate construction loans accounted for only of total loans outstanding at year end and at year end the corporation s losses on loans secured by real estate have historically been low  averaging thousand in net charges offs per year over the last five years 
consumer loans are the second largest component of evb s loan portfolio 
consumer loans were of the loan portfolio at year end  and at year end and respectively 
this portfolio component consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  up million or from million at year end  and million at year end 
performance of the consumer loan portfolio is closely tied to general economic conditions in our market region and is impacted by intense competition from both other financial institutions and the automotive industry 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million in total loans outstanding at year end compared to  with the percentage to total loans increasing to of the total loan portfolio from at year end  matching the prior four year history as a percent of total loans 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  evb generally does not make loans outside of its principal market region 
the corporation does not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
evb further maintains a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
the corporation s unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  up million from million at december  unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  evb s loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality the corporation s allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  management considers the corporation s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
evb was not immune to the declining economic environment experienced in  with a resultant increase in nonperforming loans and charge offs 
each of evb s subsidiary banks has a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members who regularly review loans 
additionally an independent credit review consultant performs a monthly review of loans he selects for southside bank and refers those deemed appropriate to the loan committee of the bank board 
bank of northumberland  inc and hanover bank maintain a review process by senior credit personnel 
as a matter of policy  the company places loans on nonaccrual status when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest  regardless of how well the loan may be collateralized 
for the corporation  this detailed management process forms the basis for determining the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
management s close attention to a deteriorating economy and its impact on evb s loan portfolio led to an increase in the reserve for loan losses in  reversing a trend that had allowed the company to lower its loan loss ratio in each of the prior three years 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end net loans  for  and was   and respectively 
for the same periods the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

quarterly nonperforming asset levels during the year were march million  june million  september million  then peaking at million at october during the last two months of the year  nonperforming assets declined by over million 
the current nonperforming asset ratio of  while above the year end level  is in line with the at year end  at year end  and superior to the at year end 
nonperforming assets at december  were million or of total loans and other real estate owned  up from million or at year end  and million or at year end 
nonperforming loans at year end consisted of million of loans secured by real estate in the corporation s market area  thousand of commercial loans and thousand of consumer loans 
based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  management considers the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such past due loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      restructured loans loans past due days and accruing interest   total nonperforming loans      other real estate owned total nonperforming assets      nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans net charge offs to average loans for the year allowance for loan losses to year end loans foregone interest income on nonaccrual loans interest income recorded on nonaccrual loans net charge offs in increased to million from thousand in year net charge offs included thousand of consumer loans and thousand of commercial loans 
the commercial loan charge offs included thousand on one relationship where the borrower is in bankruptcy proceedings 
although trends for credit quality factors improved significantly in the fourth quarter of  it is likely that evb will continue provisions for loan losses in the primary factor for additional provision is growth in the loan portfolio and the level of net charge offs on nonperforming loans 
the corporation s formula for allocation of the allowance reflects current net loans and nonaccrual loans plus the five year history for net charge offs by loan category  and in added off balance sheet credit risk

loans are viewed as potential problem loans according to the ability of such borrowers to comply with current repayment terms 
these loans are subject to constant management attention  and their status is reviewed on a regular basis 
the potential problem loans identified at december  are generally secured by residential and commercial real estate with appraised values that exceed the principal balance 
securities securities available for sale include those securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  general liquidity needs  and other similar factors  and are carried at estimated fair market value 
at december   the securities portfolio  at fair market value  was million  a increase from million at year end 
at december   the combined securities portfolio was million  a decrease from million at year end 
book value of million in the investment component of the portfolio at year end was reclassified to available for sale in early fasb pronouncement no 
effective january   requires evb to show the effect of market value changes of securities available for sale 
the market value of this portfolio at year end was million 
the effect of valuing the available for sale portfolio at market  net of income taxes  is reflected as a line in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income of thousand at december  and thousand at year end 
evb follows a policy of not engaging in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as options  futures  swaps or forward commitments 
the corporation considers derivatives to be speculative in nature and contrary to evb s historical philosophy

see note to the consolidated financial statements as of december  for an analysis of gross unrealized gains and losses in the securities portfolio 
deposits the corporation has historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost  stable source of funding for the corporation s asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
evb experienced record deposit growth in just as it did in loan growth 
total deposits at december  of million reflected an increase of million or compared to million at year end 
non interest bearing deposits increased million or to million at year end compared to million at december  during the same period  interest bearing deposits increased to million at year end  compared to million at december  while these figures are as of a specific day at year end  it is also meaningful to review average deposits for the year

capital represents original investment by shareholders along with retained earnings and provides financial resources over which management can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings 
at december   evb had total capital of and a tier ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support each subsidiary s banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio 
in january  the corporation announced a stock repurchase program intended to reduce high capital levels and to increase return on equity to shareholders 
the corporation repurchased thousand shares in  and as part of the board s previous november stock repurchase authorization thousand shares in  thousand shares in  and thousand shares in late the company anticipates a continuation of its stock repurchase efforts in the table which follows provides an analysis of the corporation s capital as of december    and note in the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the capital position of each of the subsidiary banks as of year end and analysis of capital december dollars in thousands tier capital common stock    additional paid in capital  retained earnings    total tier capital    tier capital allowable portion of allowance for loan losses    total risk based capital    risk weighted assets    capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier capital to average total assets liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
evb s management of liquid assets combined with the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding provides a liquidity level which management believes is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
evb also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  the corporation had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 
forward looking statements certain statements in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although evb believes that its expectations concerning certain forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results and performance achievements of the corporation will not differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
accounting rule changes in july   the financial accounting standards board issued two statements statement  business combinations  and statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  which will potentially impact the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement eliminates the pooling method of accounting for business combinations and requires that intangible assets that meet certain criteria be reported separately from goodwill 
the statement also requires negative goodwill arising from a business combination to be recorded as an extraordinary gain 
statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles that are determined to have an indefinite life 
the statement requires  at a minimum  annual impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life 
upon adoption of these statements  an organization is required to re evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets that arose from business combinations entered into before july  if the recorded other intangible assets do not meet the criteria for recognition  they should be classified as goodwill 
similarly  if there are other intangible assets that meet the criteria for recognition but were not separately recorded from goodwill  they should be reclassified from goodwill 
an organization also must reassess the useful lives of intangible assets and adjust the remaining amortization periods accordingly 
any negative goodwill must be written off 
the standards generally are required to be implemented by the corporation in its financial statements 
evb has no goodwill or intangible assets  therefore the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on the financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated retirement costs 
it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it also establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  which includes long lived assets that are part of a discontinued operation 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
evb s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the corporation s management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb s subsidiary banks and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
guidelines established by management are reviewed by the board of directors 
it is evb s policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
evb considers derivatives as speculative which is contrary to the company s historical or prospective philosophy 
evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it does not hold in its loan and security portfolio investments that adjust or float according to changes in the prime lending rate which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 
asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of evb s future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary measures 
static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap  at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus or minus of adjusted total assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns of balance attrition and pricing behavior which are reviewed at least annually 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would increase approximately of stable rate net income if rates were to fall immediately by two percentage points 
it projects a decrease of approximately if rates rise by two percentage points 
management believes this reflects a liability sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less that a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures

management projects interest rates to continue a moderate downward trend during the first two quarters of to a level no more than basis points below that at year end and believes that the current level of liability sensitivity is appropriate
