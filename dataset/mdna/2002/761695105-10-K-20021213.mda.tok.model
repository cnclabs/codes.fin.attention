revenue recognition sales of computer hardware and business forms products are recorded when title passes upon shipment to customers 
revenues from software license fees are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred  as research and development  until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
technological feasibility is established either by creating a detail program design or a tested working model 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
the company follows a standard process for developing software products 
this process has five phases  selection  definition  development  delivery and general customer acceptability gca 
when using proven technology  management believes that technological feasibility is established upon the completion of the definition phase ie detail program design 
when using newer technology  management believes that technological feasibility is established upon completion of the delivery phase tested working model 
once technological feasibility has been established  software development costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers gca 
software development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits for both employees and outside contractors 
upon general release of a software product  amortization is determined based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  ranging from three to seven years

the company accounts for these assets under the provisions of sfas no

requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the statement also requires recognized intangible assets with finite useful lives to be amortized over their useful lives 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
future cash flows are forecasted based on management s estimates of future events and could be materially different from actual cash flows 
if the carrying value of an asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes

these fixed rate receivables generally have repayment terms of five years 
the company funds finance receivables with debt that has repayment terms consistent with the maturities of the finance receivables 
generally the company attempts to lock in the interest spread on the fixed rate finance receivables by borrowing under fixed rate agreements or using interest rate management agreements to manage variable interest rate exposure 
management believes that over time it has reduced interest expense by using interest rate management agreements and variable rate debt instead of directly obtaining fixed rate debt 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
during fiscal year  reyna funding  llc  an affiliate of the company  entered into  of interest rate swaps in connection with obtaining  of variable rate debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of interest rate management agreements

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding the company s debt instruments and interest rate management agreements
