item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under certain factors that may affect our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
background we are a leading global provider of internet security solutions and services that make it safe to do business  communicate and complete transactions over the internet 
we have a broad set of identification  entitlements  verification  privacy and security management capabilities 
major corporations  service providers  financial institutions and government agencies in more than countries rely on the privacy  security and trust provided through our portfolio of award winning technologies 
we were incorporated in december with nominal share capital  all of which was contributed by nortel networks corporation and its subsidiary nortel networks inc at the close of business on december   nortel networks transferred to us certain of their assets and liabilities  intellectual property  rights  licenses and contracts 
in exchange  nortel networks received series a common stock  special voting stock  and cash consideration 
at the close of business on december   we issued series b common stock in a private placement 
after the completion of the private placement  nortel networks owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our voting stock assuming conversion of the series b common stock and series b non voting common stock 
on august   we closed our initial public offering  issuing  shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses incurred  were approximately million 
on february  and march   we closed our follow on offering  which included an over allotment option closing  issuing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an offering price per share 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses incurred  were approximately million 
on june   we changed our name to entrust  inc at december   nortel networks owned approximately of our common stock 
business overview fiscal was a challenging year for entrust 
the economic slowdown that began in early affected us  as it affected many companies in the technology sector 
revenues for were down to million from million in we underwent a restructuring in the second quarter of to better position ourselves in securing the internet  which we believe will be the next major phase of the internet s evolution 
our restructuring was implemented to re focus entrust back to its core geographic and vertical markets and its core technical competencies in internet security 
implementing the broad corporate wide plan resulted in a restructuring charge of million and special non recurring charges of million  including million impairment to goodwill 
the major elements of the restructuring plan included 
eliminating approximately positions  or of the existing workforce  through layoffs and attrition  
reorganizing entrust along global functional lines  versus multiple individual business programs  
closing eight offices to vacate underutilized office space that resulted from the employee reduction and global functional re alignment to a more geographically efficient organization  and 
conducting a revaluation assessment of the goodwill and other intangibles related to past acquisitions  specifically around potential impairment 
the majority of the goodwill impairment was related to the encommerce acquisition 
despite the challenges of  we achieved several major accomplishments in the year 
we were awarded the largest contract in our history  a million contract with bell nexxia for the government of canada project known as secure channel 
this contract is being accounted for on a subscription basis over four fiscal quarters with software revenue recognition beginning in the second quarter of and ending during the first quarter of  
we reduced our quarterly losses in the second half of to and losses per share in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
this compares to quarterly losses per share of and in the first and second quarters of  respectively  and 
we ended the year with million in cash and marketable securities and no debt 
going forward into  we remain focused on our core markets  both vertical and geographic  and our core technology strengths in enhanced internet security 
our success continues to be dependant on our ability to design  develop  market and sell our internet security solutions to our global customers 
critical accounting policies the nature of our business is not highly complex  as we operate in one primary business 
we develop  market and sell internet security software solutions 
we also perform professional services to install  support and integrate our internet security software solutions with other applications 
we operate globally in a functional organization 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing  other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  and we do not actively engage in hedging transactions 
in  our most complex accounting judgments were made in the areas of software revenue recognition  goodwill impairment  restructuring and other special non recurring charges  impairment of long term strategic investments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the goodwill impairment  and restructuring and other special non recurring charges are not anticipated to be recurring in nature 
software revenue recognition  impairment of long term strategic investments  and allowance for doubtful accounts are expected to continue to be an on going element of our accounting processes and judgments 
software revenue recognition with respect to software revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition and sop no 
 modifications of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized upon receipt of an executed license agreement  or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  and shipment of the software  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgment to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
different judgments and or different contract structures could have led to different accounting conclusions  which could have had a material effect on our reported quarterly earnings 
goodwill impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in  we performed our valuation of these assets based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and the relevant provisions of the sec s sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million 
million of this amount was the result of the encommerce acquisition in and million from the r acquisition in in performing this impairment assessment  management made judgments regarding the anticipated future cash flows from these acquisitions 
different assumptions in this assessment could have led to a different impairment amount  which could have had a material effect on our reported earnings 
as of december   goodwill and purchased intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to million 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective for us on january  and  as a result  we estimate on a preliminary basis that we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
we will continue to amortize million of purchased product rights 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that  at the time the review is completed  a material impairment charge will not be required 
restructuring and other special non recurring charges on june   we announced that our board of directors had approved a restructuring program to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that were negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring program included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring and other related special non recurring charges and the impact of the macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recorded restructuring and special non recurring charges  excluding goodwill impairment  of million in the second fiscal quarter of  with subsequent adjustments in the third and fourth quarters totaling million 
we conducted our assessment of the accounting effects of the restructuring program in accordance with eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations and the relevant provisions of the sec s sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the original accrued restructuring charges of million on june   including estimating future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  liabilities from employee severances  and costs to exit business activities 
changes in these assessments with respect to the accrued restructuring charges of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results 
in addition  actual results could vary from these assumptions  resulting in an adjustment that could have a material effect on our future financial results 
impairment of long term strategic investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of strategic investments on a regular basis 
factors that we consider important and that we believe could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model and changes in overall market conditions 
these investments are in private companies of which we typically own less than of the outstanding stock 
because there is not a liquid market for these securities  we often must make estimates of the value of our investments 
we recorded charges related to other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments of million in we also recorded a gain on the disposition of a long term strategic investment of million in as of december   long term strategic investments  net of valuation allowances  amounted to million 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the revenue transaction is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if any portion of a fee is due after days from the invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including previous transactions with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we base our ongoing estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on the aging of the balances in the accounts receivable  our historical collection patterns and changes in the credit worthiness of our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our accounts receivable include material balances from a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for of accounts receivable at december   as discussed in certain factors that may affect our business 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying this assessment or changes in the financial condition of our customers could result in a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on our reported quarterly earnings 
as of december   accounts receivable totaled million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million

we also generate revenues from consulting  training and post contract support  or maintenance  performed for customers who license our products 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the sop no

 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized upon receipt of an executed license agreement  or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  and shipment of the software  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
if maintenance services are included free of charge or discounted in a license agreement  such amounts are unbundled from the license fee at their fair market value based upon the value established by independent sales of such maintenance services to other customers 
revenues from the sale of web server certificates are also recognized ratably over the term of the certificate  which is typically one to two years 
consulting and training revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services are typically performed under separate service agreements and are usually performed on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation and deployment of our products and do not include significant customization or development of the underlying software code 
we use the percentage of completion method to account for fixed price custom development contracts 
under this method  we recognize revenues and profit as the work on the contract progresses 
revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of the total cost incurred to date divided by the total estimated contract cost to the total contract value  and any projected loss is recognized immediately 
the project cost estimates are reviewed on a regular basis 
total revenues 
total revenues increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in total revenues derived from north america increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in  while total revenues derived from outside of north america increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the majority of the overall decline in total revenues  in absolute dollars  in was experienced in north america  which is reflective of the prolonged economic downturn experienced in this region 
also  until the end of the second quarter of  we had focused on growing our revenue base internationally  including heavy investment in our direct sales force  particularly in europe  asia and south america  which resulted in growing revenues in and and resulted in a smaller decline in non north american revenues in however  the continued softening of the economic climate internationally and our restructuring program from the second quarter of resulted in fewer sales resources being applied to all regions  but specifically in asia pacific and latin america 
the level of non north american revenues has fluctuated from period to period  and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  a single customer accounted for of revenues  and no other customers accounted for or more of revenues 
in  no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues 
in  a single customer accounted for of revenues  and no other customers accounted for or more of revenues 
license revenues 
license revenues increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in license revenues in absolute dollars in was primarily due to the slowing of the global economy  particularly the continued economic downturn experienced in north america 
the types of license transactions most significantly impacted by the less favorable economic conditions were those license transactions greater than  in value  which normally represent a substantial deployment to a broad base of users or the addition of new applications to customers previously installed infrastructure 
the rapid global downturn has had a significant impact on information technology projects and  as a result  customers could not make the commitments we were expecting in  compared to previous years 
license revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from to and from to this was primarily as a result of a continued strong demand for services and maintenance from our customers and increased professional services revenues from the addition of cygnacom in march  and encommerce in june  and partly due to decreased license revenues in services and maintenance revenues 
services and maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in and increased to million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the increase in services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars in and was primarily the result of an increase in demand for consulting services and customer support  the acquisitions of cygnacom and encommerce  and increases in maintenance revenues from a larger installed product base and strong customer renewals of annual maintenance agreements 
the growth in our customer base has resulted in acceleration in the demand from customers to assist them in deploying our solutions 
we have invested heavily in additional professional services resources in response to this increased demand from customers  particularly throughout  and the first half of the slowed growth of our services and maintenance business from to reflected the completion of a large professional services contract in europe in the second quarter of  resulting in some lower utilization rates in this region in the second half of the year  and also reflected the slowed growth of the installed base of customers in the increase in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflected a continuing shift in the mix of revenues from license to services and maintenance revenues in  compared to and this shift was largely due to the continued growth of our services and maintenance business in response to customer demand  the impact of the professional services revenues of cygnacom and encommerce since their respective acquisitions  and the decrease in license revenues during we continue to focus on developing new service offerings for our customers that are core to our business and also on building our relationships with third party service providers so that we have adequate resources available to meet the demands of our customers 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of costs associated with product media  documentation  packaging and royalties to third party software vendors 
amortization of purchased product rights acquired as part of the acquisition of encommerce of million in and million in has been excluded from cost of license revenues and instead has been included in operating expenses 
cost of license revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
while the cost of license revenues in absolute dollars was relatively flat from to  the increase in cost of license revenues in  compared to  was primarily a result of higher royalty fees paid to third party software vendors  in response to the increase in license revenues in general and specifically for those entrust products that require third party royalty payments 
the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues was flat from to  despite the absolute dollar increase  due to the acquisition of encommerce  which eliminated our requirement to pay royalties to third party vendors related to the sale of authentication privilege management software when bundled with our pki product sales 
the increase in the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to  despite the lower software license revenue levels  was primarily a result of higher royalty rates paid to third party software vendors and an increase in the number of third party technologies embedded in our products sold 
the mix of third party products may vary from period to period and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
cost of services and maintenance revenues 
cost of services and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training and consulting services  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services 
cost of services and maintenance revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
the increase in absolute dollars in and reflected the increased costs associated with the increased levels of services and maintenance revenues experienced in those periods and the increased costs associated with the cygnacom and encommerce resources 
the increase in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in was primarily the result of slightly lower productivity and utilization for available services resources compared to  due to the training required to integrate the professional services teams acquired from cygnacom and encommerce as well as the new employees hired in the increase in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in reflected the rapid growth of services and maintenance revenues in comparison to license revenues  and reflected the significant shift in the mix of revenues from license to services and maintenance revenues during this period 
as the services and maintenance revenues represented the larger proportion of total revenues and grew faster than total revenues  the cost of generating those services and maintenance revenues represented a much larger percentage when compared against total revenues  because significant investment was necessary in order to prepare for current and future growth in this business 
also  we made significant investments in additional customer support personnel to support the growing base of customers with previously installed products in and services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues was in  in and in the decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues from to  and from to reflected the investment we made in the professional services team through the acquisition of cygnacom late in the first quarter of and encommerce at the end of the second quarter of  which represented a slight shift in the mix of components within services revenues toward the lower margin professional services revenues 
also  the decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues reflected the investment made in additional customer support personnel in and  and the continued development and rollout of new services offerings  especially prior to our restructuring in the second quarter of operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  in thousands per statement of operations    less special non recurring charges included  pro forma    percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  on a pro forma basis  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars from to were primarily the result of costs associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing organization  both domestically and internationally  up until the end of the first half of in addition  until the implementation of our restructuring plan in june  we continued to make significant investments in marketing to support the launch of new products  services and marketing programs 
we had continued our strategy of investing in a hiring and training the members of our direct sales organization in anticipation of future market growth  and b marketing efforts in support of new product launches 
the sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in  compared to  has remained fairly consistent 
however  the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in  compared to  was mainly due to the combination of lower than expected license revenues in the first half of  and sales and marketing expenses that were largely fixed prior to the beginning of each of the first two quarters of based on expected license revenues for those periods 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in also reflected the increased expenses related to the impact of the encommerce sales and marketing organization 
we will continue to focus on improving the productivity of our sales and marketing organizations  in light of the current economic conditions 
failure of these investments in sales and marketing  as adjusted through our restructuring plan  to generate future revenues will have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
research and development year ended december  in thousands per statement of operations    less special non recurring charges included pro forma    percentage of total revenues research and development expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increased investment in research and development expenses in absolute dollars from to reflected higher expenses related to increased staffing of software developers 
we had hired these employees primarily in connection with the continuing expansion  enhancement and globalization of our product offerings  our commitment to quality assurance and testing  and the addition of development employees in connection with the acquisition of encommerce 
the investment in research and development as a percentage of total revenues increased in  compared to and  due primarily to the lower than expected license revenues in the first half of  as these costs were largely fixed prior to the start of the first two quarters of  and due to the acquisition of encommerce and the corresponding addition of the getaccess tm development team 
the cost reduction impact of our restructuring on research and development expenses did not come into effect until june however  we believe that we must continue to invest in research and development in order to maintain our technological leadership position and  thus  we expect research and development to increase in absolute dollars in the future as additional experienced security experts and software engineers are required 
general and administrative year ended december  in thousands per statement of operations    less special non recurring charges included  pro forma    percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and million in  on a pro forma basis  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars reflected our continued investment in increased staffing and related expenses for the enhancement of the infrastructure necessary to support our changing business  including investor relation programs  improved management information systems and the increased utilization of outside professional service firms 
in addition  the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was partly due to expenses we incurred in connection with the resignation of a senior executive 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased in  compared to and  due primarily to the lower than expected license revenues in the first half of  as these costs were largely fixed prior to the start of each quarter 
the cost reduction impact of our restructuring on general and administrative expenses did not come into effect until june we continue to look for ways to gain additional efficiencies in our administrative processes 
acquired in process research and development and amortization of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles on march   we completed the acquisition of cygnacom  a company based in mclean  virginia that delivers information technology products and services  with expertise in public key infrastructure  cryptographic technologies  security engineering and systems integration and development 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated march   entered into between us  cygnacom and the shareholders of cygnacom  we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of cygnacom for an aggregate purchase price of million  which included cash consideration of million 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and  therefore  the results of operations of cygnacom are included in our financial statements from the acquisition date 
upon consummation of the acquisition  cygnacom became a wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million and  accordingly  we have expensed million and million of goodwill amortization in and  respectively 
on june   we completed the acquisition of encommerce  a company based in santa clara  california that provides software and services for managing global e business relationships 
the acquisition of encommerce s outstanding capital stock  options and warrants for a total consideration of million was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  which resulted in an allocation of million to purchased product rights  goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
also  in connection with this acquisition  an appraisal was done of the intangible assets  resulting in million of the purchase price being allocated to in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
this in process research and development was expensed in june amortization of purchased product rights of million and million were expensed in and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles of million and million were expensed in and  respectively 
in addition  we recorded amortization of   and  in  and  respectively  with respect to goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of r in amortization expense in connection with acquisition related intangibles decreased in  as compared to  due to the impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles recorded in june restructuring and other special non recurring charges on june   we announced a board approved restructuring program to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that were negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring program includes a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring and other related special non recurring charges and the impact of the macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recognized restructuring and special non recurring charges of million in the second fiscal quarter of  with subsequent adjustments in the third and fourth quarter of million  as outlined below in millions total adjustments special recorded total special charges july  charges accrued other special through to through restructuring non recurring june  december  december  charges charges workforce reduction and other personnel costs consolidation of excess facilities discontinuance of non core products and programs impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other intangible purchased assets write down of long term strategic investments bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts total the following paragraphs provide information relating to the restructuring programs that resulted in the total special charges listed above  which were recognized in workforce reduction and other personnel costs the restructuring program resulted in the reduction of approximately of our regular full time employees  or of the total workforce 
the reduction was across all major geographic locations  all business programs and all functions within the organization 
the reductions were more heavily weighted in sales and marketing  non core business programs such as entrust 
net tm and entrust yourservice tm and secondary geographies such as asia pacific and latin america 
the majority of the affected employees were notified of their termination in the second quarter  and the workforce portion of the restructuring was largely completed by the end of the fourth quarter of we recorded a workforce reduction charge of million primarily related to severance costs  fringe benefits due to severed employees and outplacement services 
other special non recurring charges included employee relocation expenses  hiring fees and signing bonuses totaling million  which were recorded primarily in general and administrative expenses 
consolidation of excess facilities we recorded restructuring costs of million relating to the consolidation of excess facilities 
the consolidation of excess facilities includes a total of eight offices in seven cities throughout the world 
the majority approximately of the costs are related to the  square foot facility in santa clara  ca 
the costs for consolidation of excess facilities are related primarily to non cancelable lease costs offset by estimated sublet recoveries 
these costs are payable contractually over up to years  which is the lease term of the santa clara facility 
however  we will be evaluating ongoing possibilities to settle this obligation in the most economic manner 
in addition to the million of restructuring costs related to excess facilities  an additional million of facilities related costs were recorded as a special non recurring charge as a result of impairment of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment that was disposed of or removed from operations as a result of the consolidation of excess facilities  and were included in the write down of leaseholds and other long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
these assets were identified as assets to be disposed of that would have no future benefit to us 
therefore  these assets were reported at the lower of carrying amount and fair value  less costs of disposition 
the majority of these costs are non cash charges 
discontinuance of non core products and programs in support of the restructuring objective to reduce costs and focus on our core technologies  we discontinued several non core products and programs 
the discontinued products and programs  totaling million  are primarily related to our services business initiatives and to certain desktop applications for which we have not achieved the growth and profitability targets in line with our core products and financial objectives 
the restructuring charge also includes costs related to the exit of certain marketing events and programs that had been committed to prior to the restructuring  but which are being cancelled due to the change in corporate focus 
the cash outflow related to the majority of these items is expected to be substantially incurred by the end of the first quarter of fiscal accrued estimated minimum royalty obligations related to certain discontinued products of million are payable contractually over the next three years 
the discontinuance of products and programs  and expenses related to rebranding of our identity and our products  resulted in million of special non recurring charges  which was primarily recorded in sales and marketing expenses 
summary of accrued restructuring charges the following table is a summary of the accrued restructuring charges as at december  in millions total accrued charges restructuring accrued at charges at june  cash december  payments adjustments workforce reduction and other personnel costs consolidation of excess facilities discontinuance of non core products and programs total impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other intangible purchased assets due to the decline in our market capitalization  the decline in current overall business conditions within our target market segments and the restructuring program  we completed an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill on our balance sheet  in accordance with apb opinion no 
and the relevant guidance in sfas no 
this impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of the goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets of the encommerce and r acquisitions will not be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
we then completed an analysis of the discounted future cash flows from the encommerce acquisition and the r acquisition 
the result of this analysis is a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets 
goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles from the encommerce acquisition account for million of the impairment 
this acquisition has failed to meet the financial planning forecasts made at the time of the acquisition due largely to the change in the economic conditions since the time of the acquisition and in part due to additional product development and maintenance costs related to the getaccess tm product that are now estimated to be required in the future and were not known at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining million of goodwill impairment is the result of the r acquisition  which was impacted primarily by the workforce restructuring 
revenues from the encommerce products and services are estimated to have contributed approximately to of total revenues in  but are estimated to have generated operating losses since acquisition 
the results of operations related to the r acquisition were not significant 
write down of long term strategic investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our strategic investments on a regular basis 
factors that we consider important that could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model  and changes in overall market conditions 
we recorded charges related to other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments of million in we also recorded a gain on the disposition of a long term strategic investment of million in bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts due to the changes in the economic environment and the impact of the restructuring program  particularly the curtailment of certain products and presence in certain geographies  we recorded bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts totaling million in the year ended december   which was recorded primarily in sales and marketing expenses 
interest income interest income increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in investment income for from reflected the reduced balance of funds invested  as these amounts have been drawn down to fund cash flow from operations and to acquire long lived assets and long term strategic investments 
in addition  the decrease was due to the lower interest rates that were available in compared to the increase in investment income from to reflected the interest earned on cash provided by operations in and  and on the net proceeds of our follow on offering in february and march provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in  million in and million we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
the effective income tax rates differed from statutory rates primarily due to the non deductibility of in process research and development  amortization and impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights  and other purchased intangible assets  as well as adjustment of the valuation allowance that has offset substantially the tax benefits from the significant net operation loss and tax credit carry forwards available 
quarterly results of operations our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  our period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the completion date of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of our products often requires a significant capital investment  which customers may view as a discretionary cost and  therefore  a purchase that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  therefore  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues are heavily dependent upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we have generally recorded a significant portion of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we expect these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly license revenues are dependent on the timing of revenue recognition  which can be affected by many factors  including the timing of customer installations and acceptance 
in these regards  we have from time to time experienced delays in recognizing revenues with respect to certain orders 
in any period a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
despite the uncertainties in our revenue patterns  our operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout the quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are delayed or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected in a significant way 
under our restructuring program  as discussed earlier  the levels of operating expenses decreased and the net loss decreased in the third and fourth quarters of the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
these data have been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report

our average days sales outstanding at december  was days  which represents a decrease from the days that we reported at december  the overall decrease in days sales outstanding from december  reflected an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  better collection cycles despite longer payment terms for international customers  and improved linearity of revenues during the last two quarters of for purposes of calculating average days sales outstanding  we divide ending accounts receivable by the current quarter s revenues and multiply this amount by days 
the level of accounts receivable at each quarter end will be affected by the concentration of revenues in the final weeks of each quarter and may be negatively affected by expanded international revenues in relation to total revenues as licenses to international customers often have longer payment terms 
during  we generated million of cash in investing activities  primarily due to cash provided by reductions in our marketable investments in the amount of million  net of million of marketable investment purchases  and proceeds of million from the disposition of a long term strategic investment 
this was partially offset by million invested in property and equipment  million invested in long term strategic investments and million invested in other long term assets 
the property and equipment investments were primarily computer hardware  furniture and leasehold improvements to support our growing organization  largely costs related to the fit up of our new facility in addison  texas and completion of the fit up of our facilities in santa clara  california and ottawa  canada 
the long term investments funded were strategic in nature  represented investments in less than of the capital stock of privately held electronic security and technology companies or advances to existing investees  and were accounted for on a cost basis 
the investment in other long term assets relates primarily to product localization work performed by third party contractors and a security deposit for our addison facility 
cash provided by financing activities for was million  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
for disclosure regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  please see notes and to our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in the amount of million provided our principal sources of liquidity 
overall  we used million from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in although we expect improved profitability in as we progress towards breakeven operating earnings  we estimate that we will continue to use cash in to fund operating losses and to satisfy the obligations accrued for under our restructuring program 
while there can be no assurance as to the extent of usage of liquid resources in the next fiscal year  we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
certain factors that may affect our business our quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and such fluctuations may lead to a reduced market price for our stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  but securities analysts and investors often rely upon these comparisons as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past and which are likely to affect us in the future include the following 
length of sales cycles associated with our product offerings  
the timing  size and nature of our licensing transactions  
market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  
the relative proportions of revenues derived from licenses and services and maintenance  
the timing of new personnel hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  
changes in pricing policies by our competitors  
changes in our operating expenses  and 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in june we signed a million contract with bell nexxia for the government of canada project known as secure channel 
this contract is being accounted for on a subscription basis over four fiscal quarters  with software revenue recognition beginning in the second quarter of and ending during the first quarter of as a result of the completion of the subscription period  we will have to increase new software license revenues by a larger amount than achieved in the past four quarters in order to maintain operating results at current levels 
while we are focused on marketing programs and revenue generating opportunities to increase software revenues  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will be successful 
estimating future revenues is difficult  and our failure to do so accurately may lead to a reduced market price for our stock and reduced profitability 
estimating future revenues is difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  as such  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues depend heavily upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we historically have recorded to of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of revenues in the second half of that month 
we expect that this concentration of revenues  which is attributable in part to the tendency of some customers to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter and to sales patterns within the software industry  will continue for the foreseeable future 
our expense levels are based  in significant part  upon our expectations as to future revenues and are largely fixed in the short term 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations could have an immediate and significant effect on our profitability for that quarter and may lead to a reduced market price for our stock 
our restructuring of operations may not achieve the results we intend and may harm our business 
in june  we announced a restructuring of our business  which included a reduction in work force and the closure of three international locations  as well as other steps we took to reduce expenses 
the planning and implementation of our restructuring has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
additionally  the restructuring may negatively affect our employee turnover  recruiting and retention of important employees 
if we are unable to implement our restructuring effectively or if we experience difficulties in effecting the restructuring  our expenses could increase more quickly than we are expecting 
if we find that our restructuring announced in june did not sufficiently decrease the growth of our expenses  we may find it necessary to implement further streamlining of our expenses  to perform another reduction in our headcount or to undertake a restructuring of our business 
because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle associated with our large software transactions  we may not succeed in closing transactions on a timely basis or at all  which would adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
transactions for our solutions often involve large expenditures  and the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
factors affecting the sales cycle include 
customers budgetary constraints  
the timing of customers budget cycles  and 
customers internal approval processes 
we may not succeed in closing such large transactions on a timely basis or at all  which could cause significant variability in our revenues and results of operations for any particular period 
if our results of operations and cash flows fall below the expectations of securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues  which may decline if we cannot keep or replace these customer relationships 
historically  a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
in  our three largest customers accounted for of revenues  with the largest customer accounting for of revenues 
in  our three largest customers accounted for of revenues 
in  our three largest customers accounted for of revenues 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers 
in addition  we anticipate that such customers will continue to vary over time  so that the achievement of our long term goals will require us to obtain additional significant customers on an ongoing basis 
our failure to enter into a sufficient number of large licensing agreements during a particular period could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues 
if the internet security market does not continue to grow  demand for our products and services will be adversely affected 
the market for internet security solutions is at an early stage of development 
continued growth of the internet security market will depend  in large part  on the following 
the continued expansion of internet usage and the number of organizations adopting or expanding intranets and extranets  
the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  
the public recognition of the potential threat posed by computer hackers and other unauthorized users  and 
the continued development of new and improved services for implementation across the internet  intranets and extranets 
a decline in the growth of this market could reduce demand for our products  adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
a breach of security at one of our customers  whether or not due to our products  could harm our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
the processes used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and intranets are rapidly evolving 
a well publicized actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether such breach is attributable to our products  third party technology used within our products or any significant advance in techniques for decoding or cracking encrypted information  could adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products  and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products 
as our products contain errors or bugs  sales of our products would likely decline if some of these bugs or the number of bugs were significant 
like virtually all software systems  our products contain errors  failures or bugs that our existing testing procedures have not detected 
the errors may become evident at any time during the life of our products 
the discovery of any errors  failures or bugs in any products  including third party technology incorporated into our products  may result in 
adverse publicity  
product returns  
the loss or delay of market acceptance of our products  and 
third party claims against us 
accordingly  the discovery of any errors  failures or bugs would have a significant adverse effect on the sales of our products 
our revenues may decline if we cannot compete successfully in an intensely competitive market 
we target our products at the rapidly evolving market for internet security solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to react more quickly to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  certain of our current competitors in particular segments of the security marketplace may in the future broaden or enhance their offerings to provide a more comprehensive solution competing more fully with our functionality 
increased competition  as well as consolidation of competitors  could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products and services to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could have a serious adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will not be successful if we do not keep up with the rapid changes in our industry 
the emerging market for internet security products and related services is characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
to be competitive  we have to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings  and be first to market with new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services 
our failure to develop and introduce new products and services successfully on a timely basis and to achieve market acceptance for such products and services could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our expanding operations  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
the growth in the size and complexity of our business over the past few years has placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
our ability to manage future growth  if any  will depend upon our ability to 
continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis  and 
expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations 
the geographic dispersal of our operations  including the separation of our headquarters in addison  texas  from our research and development facilities in ottawa  canada  and santa clara  california and from our european headquarters in reading  united kingdom  may make it more difficult to manage our growth 
if we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the field of cryptography  and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key scientific  technical  sales and managerial employees or that we can attract  motivate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
if we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
future acquisitions or investments could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
it is possible  as part of our future growth strategy  that we will from time to time acquire or make investments in companies  technologies  product solutions or professional services offerings 
with respect to these acquisitions  we would face the difficulties of assimilating personnel and operations from the acquired businesses and the problems of retaining and motivating key personnel from such businesses 
in addition  these acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day business  increase our expenses and adversely impact our results of operations 
any future acquisitions would involve certain other risks  including the assumption of additional liabilities  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of debt 
in addition  these types of transactions often result in charges to earnings for such items as amortization of goodwill or in process research and development expenses 
we face risks associated with our international operations  which  if not managed properly  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the future  we may establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and establish relationships with additional partners internationally 
this expansion would require significant management attention and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although our international sales currently are primarily denominated in us dollars  we may increasingly denominate sales in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  our international business may be subject to the following risks 
difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  
difficulties in obtaining us export licenses  especially for products containing encryption technology  
potentially longer payment cycles for customer payments  
increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  
introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  
difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  
difficulties managing personnel and operations in remote locations  and 
increased complexity in global corporate tax structure 
any one of these could significantly and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if the laws regarding exports of our products further limit or otherwise restrict our business  we could be prohibited from shipping our products to restricted countries  which would result in a loss of revenues 
some of our products are subject to export controls under laws of the us  canada and other countries 
the list of products and countries for which exports are restricted  and the relevant regulatory policies  are likely to be revised from time to time 
if we cannot obtain required government approvals under these regulations  we may not be able to sell products abroad or make products available for sale internationally via computer networks such as the internet 
furthermore  us governmental controls on the exportation of encryption products and technology may in the future restrict our ability to freely export some of our products with the most powerful information security encryption technology 
see business regulatory matters for a discussion of our regulatory environment 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  nondisclosure agreements  shrink wrap licenses and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may 
copy aspects of our products  
obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  or 
infringe upon our patents 
policing piracy and other unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  third parties might successfully design around our patents or obtain patents that we would need to license or design around 
finally  the protections we have obtained may not be sufficient because 
some courts have held that shrink wrap licenses  because they are not signed by the licensee  are not enforceable  
our trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and patents may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information  and 
we may not seek additional patents on our technology or products and such patents  even if obtained  may not be broad enough to protect our technology or products 
our inability or failure to protect our proprietary rights could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to  and may in the future become subject to  intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention 
as the number of security products in the industry and the functionality of these products further overlaps  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement of misappropriation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others 
we received notice from one of our customers stating that we may be responsible for indemnifying that customer under a product license agreement for infringement of patents assigned to a third party 
to date  the customer has not made a formal claim for indemnification from us 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future 
defending or enforcing our intellectual property could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a successful claim against us could also have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which damages are paid 
we may lose access to technology that we license from outside vendors  which loss could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we rely on outside licensors for patent and or software license rights in technology that is incorporated into and is necessary for the operation of our products 
for example  our ability to provide web server certificates in the future is dependent upon a licensing agreement we have with baltimore technologies  one of our primary competitors 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to such technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of our products 
any inability to continue to procure or use such technology could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to sell some of our products 
our stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  highly volatile and may be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as 
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  
announcements of technological innovations  
new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  
developments with respect to patents  copyrights or propriety rights  
conditions and trends in the security industry  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and 
general market conditions and other factors 
nortel networks is able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder and board approval and could make decisions about our business that conflict with the interests of other stockholders 
as of february   nortel networks limited  through its subsidiary  nortel networks inc  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting stock  and one of our ten directors was a representative of nortel networks 
accordingly  nortel networks has the ability to exert significant influence over our affairs  including the election of directors and decisions relating to our strategic and operating activities 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that other stockholders may find favorable 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that are in your best interests 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions  including a staggered board of directors that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or may discourage bids to do so 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk associated with interest rates our investment policy states that we will invest our cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  in investments that are designed to preserve principal  maintain liquidity and maximize return 
we actively manage our investments in accordance with these objectives 
some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk  whereby a change in market interest rates will cause the principal amount of the underlying investment to fluctuate 
therefore  depreciation in principal value of an investment is possible in situations where the investment is made at a fixed interest rate and the market interest rate then subsequently increases 
we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers 
we also restrict the investments to primarily securities with short term maturities  such that  at december   the majority of our marketable investments had maturities of less than six months from that date 
as a result  we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal 
the following table presents the cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments that we held at december  and  that would have been subject to interest rate risk  and the related ranges of maturities as of that date december  december  maturity maturity within within months months greater than months months months months greater than months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents   investments classified as held to maturity marketable investments 
       total amortized cost 
       fair value        risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  specifically between the united states and canada  the united kingdom  germany  france  japan and switzerland 
however  this exposure is considered to be minimal due to the fact that the united kingdom  german  french  japanese and swiss operations are not significant  and the canadian operations are naturally hedged against exchange rate fluctuations since both revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
therefore  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  but the expenses would be lowered in a corresponding fashion 
as a result  we do not engage in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses remains minimal 
risk associated with equity investments we hold short term equity securities of a publicly traded company 
it is possible that the market value of these securities could decline significantly in the near future 
for example  due to stock market volatility  we had recorded an unrealized loss of million in this investment based on its market value at december  in connection with this investment  we had engaged in a hedging transaction that provided us with the right to receive an amount equal to the difference between the price we paid for these securities and the aggregate of the fair market values on the dates that the securities are made available for sale on the public market 
we accounted for this option as a fair value hedge  in accordance with sfas no 
and  as a result  recorded an unrealized gain of million on the hedge instrument 
prior to december   we exercised the call option and  consequently  received additional shares of the investee 
at december   we recorded an unrealized loss of  on the remaining portion of these shares owned  in order to adjust the cost basis to reflect market value 
upon completion of this call option  the hedge was successful in covering the majority of the original investment value 
however  hedging activity may not always sufficiently cover the value of the corresponding investment 
in addition  we have invested in several privately held companies  most of which are technology companies in the start up or development stage  or are companies with technologies and products that are targeted at geographically distant markets 
if the demand for the technologies and products offered by these privately held companies materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant markets  we could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these companies 
to date  we have recorded losses of million from impairments and a realized gain of million from dispositions in connection with these investments
