for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories are presented at the lower of cost or market 
inventory reserves are provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items or technological obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our products are characterized mainly by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
revenues from product sales are recognized when delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the costs of insignificant related obligations mainly installations and training which are not material to functionality are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
estimated sales returns are accrued upon recognition of sales based on lumenis experience and management s estimates 
revenues from service contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the related service contracts 
goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  the company compares the carrying amount of the assets to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows is based on the company s weighted average cost of capital  which represents the blended after tax costs of debt and equity 
any impairment loss is recognized in the statement of operations

the company intends to furnish all documents and information requested and cooperate with the sec and is currently in the process of collecting and producing such documents and information 
the company is unable to predict the duration or outcome of this process 
following the company s announcement of the information request from the sec  several plaintiffs law firms announced the filing of purported class action suits in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  on behalf of purchasers of securities of lumenis ltd 
between january  and february   inclusive the class period  against the company and certain of its officers and directors

the company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
risks related to the company s business the company s future success depends on its ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of its customers 
the company s future success depends on its ability to anticipate its customers needs and develop products that address those needs 
this will require the company to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company cannot assure that it will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s failure to do so could lead to a reduction in net sales and its business may be harmed 
the company s market is unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards  and  if the company fails to keep up with such changes  its business and operating results will be harmed 
the company s industry is characterized by extensive research and development  rapid technological change  frequent innovations and new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
demand for the company s products could be significantly diminished by new technologies or products that replace them or render them obsolete  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the market for laser and light based systems for aesthetic and medical applications is relatively new and the company s business will suffer if we fail to educate customers or if the market does not develop as we expect

the company cannot be certain that a broad based market for its products will emerge among service providers and their patients or end use customers 
both these groups may opt to continue with procedures with which they are familiar rather than investing in high technology alternatives that do not have decades long safety and performance track records 
the company needs to educate potential end use customers about the benefits of ipl and laser systems  but the company cannot assure that it will succeed in this 
if the company s anticipated markets do not develop or develop more slowly than expected  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected

the company has incurred substantial research and development expenditures in the past  and plans to continue to do so in the future 
over the last three fiscal years  the company s research and development expenses have been in the range of to of net revenues 
the company cannot assure that its expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or  if such products are introduced  that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance 
the company s failure to address rapid technological changes in its markets could adversely affect its business and results of operations 
the company s products are subject to us  us and international medical regulations and controls  which impose substantial financial costs on it and which can prevent or delay the introduction of new products 
the company s ability to sell its products is subject to various federal  state and international rules and regulations 
in the united states  the company is subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda  to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the regulatory process is costly  lengthy and uncertain 
unless an exemption applies  each device that the company wishes to market in the united states must receive prior review by the fda before it can be marketed 
certain products qualify for a section k k procedure under which the manufacturer gives the fda pre market notification of the manufacturer s intention to commence marketing the product 
the manufacturer must  among other things  establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a previously marketed product 
in some cases  the manufacturer may be required to include clinical data gathered under an investigational device exemption  or ide  granted by the fda allowing human clinical studies 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can take longer 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure  the manufacturer must file a pre market approval application  or pma  based on testing intended to demonstrate that the product is both safe and effective 
the pma requires more extensive clinical testing than the k procedure and generally involves a significantly longer fda review process 
approval of a pma allowing commercial sale of a product requires pre clinical laboratory and animal tests and human clinical studies conducted under an ide establishing safety and effectiveness 
for products subject to pre market approval  the regulatory process generally takes from one to three years or more and involves substantially greater risks and commitment of resources than the k clearance process 
the company may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis  if at all  for any of its products under development and delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances could have an adverse effect on its business 
following clearance or approval  marketed products are subject to continuing regulation 
the company is required to adhere to the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  and similar regulations in other countries  which include design  testing  quality control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with qsr  labeling and other applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections and market surveillance by the fda and by comparable agencies in other countries 
the company s failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action  which could have an adverse effect on its business 
the fda can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as o fines  injunctions and civil penalties  o recall or seizure of the company s products  o requiring the company to repair  replace or refund the cost of its products  o the issuance of public notices or warnings  o operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  o refusal of the company s requests for k clearance pre market approval of new products  o withdrawal of k clearance or pre market approvals already granted  and o criminal prosecution 
similarly  the european union  or eu  determined in that the marketing or selling of any medical product or device within the european union necessitates a ce mark 
the company is now required to comply with the european medical device directive s criteria and obtain the ce mark prior to the sale of its medical products in any eu member state 
the european medical device directive sets out specific requirements for each stage a medical product goes through  from design to final inspection 
the company s products are subject to additional similar regulations in most of the international markets in which the company sells its products 
changes to existing us  us and international rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s ability to sell its current line of products in the united states  the european union and internationally  and could increase its costs and could materially adversely impact on its results of operations 
the company depends on its facilities in israel and on its international sales 
many of its customers operations are also located outside the us the company s principal executive offices and one of its five manufacturing facilities are located in israel 
moreover  many of its customers operations are located outside the us the company s net sales are derived primarily from international sales through its international sales subsidiaries and exports to foreign distributors and resellers 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for the majority of its revenues in the foreseeable future 
the company s international operations and sales are subject to a number of risks  including o longer accounts receivable collection periods  o the impact of recessions on economies worldwide  o reduced protection for intellectual property worldwide  o political and economic instability  o regulatory limitations imposed by foreign governments  o political risks  o disruption or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or government agencies  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties  tax laws and other trade barriers  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o preference for locally produced products  and o potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 
the company is also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect the sales price of its products in foreign markets as well as the costs and expenses of its international sales subsidiaries 
while the company uses forward exchange contracts  currency swap contracts  currency options and other risk management techniques to hedge its foreign currency exposure  it remains exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition to the general risks listed above  the company s operations in israel are subject to certain country specific risks described below under risks relating to the company s location in israel 
the company faces challenges as it integrates new and diverse operations 
the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  growth in the scope and complexity of its operations and an increase in the number of its employees 
this growth  including its acquisition of the coherent medical products division  has strained the company s managerial  financial  manufacturing and other resources 
in order to manage the company s growth  it must continue to implement additional operating and financial systems and controls 
if the company fails to successfully implement such systems and controls in a timely and cost effective manner as it grows  its business and financial performance could be materially adversely affected 
any acquisitions the company makes could harm or disrupt its business without bringing the anticipated synergies 
the company has in the past made acquisitions of other businesses  and it continues to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions 
in the event of any future acquisitions  the company could issue ordinary shares that would dilute its current shareholders percentage ownership  pay cash  incur debt  assume liabilities  or incur expenses related to in process research and development  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
these purchases also involve numerous risks  including o problems combining the acquired operations  technologies or products  o unanticipated costs or liabilities  o adverse effects on existing business relationships with distributors  suppliers and customers  o diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  and o potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
the company depends on skilled personnel to operate its business effectively in a rapidly changing market  and if the company is unable to retain existing or hire additional personnel  its ability to develop and sell its products could be harmed 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its key senior management and technical personnel  any of who would be difficult to replace 
as the company grows  it will be required to increase the number of qualified engineers and other employees at its existing facilities  as well as at facilities it may acquire 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and the company s business could be adversely affected by the loss of the services of any of its existing key personnel 
the company cannot assure that it will continue to be successful in hiring and properly training sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and in effectively managing its growth 
the company s inability to attract  retain  motivate and train qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company anticipates a decline in selling prices of its products as competition increases  which could adversely affect its operating results 
the company has in the past experienced decreases in the average selling prices of some of its products 
the company anticipates that as competing products become more widely available  the average selling price of its products may decrease 
trends toward managed care  health care cost containment and other changes in government and private sector initiatives in the united states and other countries in which the company does business are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies which could also adversely affect the prices or its products 
if the company is unable to offset the anticipated decrease in its average selling prices by increasing its sales volumes  its net sales will decline 
in addition  to maintain the company s gross margins  it must continue to reduce the cost of its products 
further  as average selling prices of the company s current products decline  it must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins 
if the company cannot maintain it net sales and gross margins  its operating results could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling prices of its products decrease significantly 
the company may not be able to protect its proprietary technology  which could adversely affect its competitive advantage 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure and confidentiality agreements and other restrictions on disclosure to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company has obtained and now holds approximately patents worldwide and has applied for approximately patents worldwide 
the company cannot assure that its patent applications will be approved  that any patents that may be issued will protect its intellectual property or that any issued patents will not be challenged by third parties 
other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to the company 
the company cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent the misappropriation of its intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect its proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
moreover  if the company loses any key personnel  it may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of its technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
the laws of foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the company could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm its business 
the laser and light based systems industry is characterized by a very large number of patents  many of which are of questionable validity and some of which appear to overlap with other issued patents 
as a result  there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the industry regarding patent protection and infringement 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
the company currently is  and in the future it may continue to be  a party to litigation as a result of alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
these claims and any resulting lawsuits  if resolved adversely to the company  could subject the company to significant liability for damages or invalidation of its proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be applications now pending of which the company is unaware  which may later result in issued patents which its products may infringe 
if any of the company s products infringes a valid patent  or if the company wishes to avoid potential intellectual property litigation on its alleged infringement  the company could be prevented from selling that product unless it can obtain a license  which may be unavailable  pay substantial royalties  or redesign the product to avoid infringement 
the company also may not be successful in any attempt to redesign its product to avoid any infringement 
the company has in the past and may also in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its proprietary rights to protect these rights or to determine the scope and validity of its proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
these claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of its technical and management personnel and the final outcome may not be favorable to the company 
if the company is forced to take any of these actions  its business may be seriously harmed 
the long sales cycles for the company s products may cause it to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues 
customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating  testing and qualifying the company s products before making a decision to purchase them  resulting in a lengthy initial sales cycle 
while the company s customers are evaluating its products it may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize its products to the customer s needs 
the company may also expend significant management efforts  increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead time components or materials 
even after this evaluation process  a potential customer may not purchase its products 
as a result  these long sales cycles may cause the company to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenue to offset those expenses 
the markets in which the company sells its products are intensely competitive and increased competition could cause reduced sales levels  reduced gross margins or the loss of market share 
competition in the various laser and light products markets in which the company provides products is intense and is based upon price  product performance  quality  reliability and customer service 
the company s aesthetic products compete against products offered by candela corporation  cynosure  inc  laserscope  inc 
and altus medical inc 
among others  the company s medical products compete against products offered by diomed inc  dornier medtech  and bioletic ag among others  and the company s ophthalmic products compete against products offered by carl zeiss micro imaging inc  nidek technologies inc  and iridex corporation 
the company s competitors range in size from small single product companies to large multifaceted corporations with significant financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
some of these competitors may be able to devote greater resources than the company can to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
any business combinations or mergers among the company s competitors  forming larger competitors with greater resources  or the acquisition of a competitor by a major medical or technology corporation seeking to enter this business  could result in increased competition 
if the company fails to accurately forecast component and material requirements for its products  it could incur additional costs and significant delays in shipments  which could result in loss of customers 
the company must accurately predict both the demand for its products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components and materials that the company orders vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for components 
due to the sophisticated nature of the components  some of the company s suppliers may need at least six months lead time 
if the company overestimates its component and material requirements  it may have excess inventory  which would increase its costs 
if the company underestimates its component and material requirements  it may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt and delay delivery of its products to its customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact the company s net sales  business and operating results 
the company s dependence on sole source suppliers exposes it to possible supply interruptions that could delay or prevent the manufacture of its systems 
certain of the components used in the company s products are purchased from single sources 
while the company believes that most of these components are available from alternate sources  an interruption of these or other supplies could adversely affect its ability to manufacture some of its systems 
some of the company s medical customers willingness to purchase its products depends on their ability to obtain reimbursement for medical procedures using its products and its revenues could suffer from changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies 
the company s medical segment customers include doctors  clinics  hospitals and other health care providers whose willingness and ability to purchase its products depends in part upon their ability to obtain reimbursement for medical procedures using its products from third party payers  including private insurance companies  and in the us from health maintenance organizations  and federal  state and local government programs  including medicare and medicaid 
third party payers are increasingly scrutinizing health care costs submitted for reimbursement and may deny coverage and reimbursement for the medical procedures made possible by the company s products 
failure by the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payers for medical procedures that use its products or changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies could have a material adverse effect on its sales  results of operations and financial condition 
some of the company s laser and intense pulsed light ipl systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by its customers and could lead to product liability claims 
laser and pulsed light systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
the technical complexity of the company s products  changes in its or its suppliers manufacturing processes  the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by the company or its suppliers and other factors could restrict its ability to achieve acceptable product reliability 
if the company is unable to prevent or fix defects or other problems  it could experience  among other things o legal actions by its customers and their patients  o loss of customers  o failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  o increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses  o damage to its brand reputation  and o diversion of development  engineering and management resources 
in addition  some of the company s products are combined with products from other vendors  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
there are also the risks of physical injury to the patient when treated with one of the company s products  even if the product is not defective 
although the company has obtained product liability insurance  the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of  or outside of  its insurance coverage could adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
the company may be required to implement a costly product recall in the event that any of the company s products proves to be defective  it may voluntarily recall  or the fda could require it to redesign or implement a recall of  any of its products 
though it is not possible to quantify the economic impact of a recall  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company uses laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous  and it could be liable for any damage or liability resulting from accidental environmental contamination or injury 
although most of the company s products do not incorporate any hazardous or toxic materials or chemicals  some of the gases used in the company s excimer lasers are highly toxic 
in addition  the company s operations involve the use of laboratory and manufacturing materials that could be considered hazardous 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with all israeli  local and us federal and state regulations and standards  the risk of accidental environmental contamination or injury from such materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident involving such materials  the company could be liable for any damage and such liability could exceed the amount of its liability insurance coverage and the resources of its business 
if the company s facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  its operations would be seriously harmed 
the company s facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood or earthquake 
a substantial portion of the company s research and development activities and manufacturing  and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in santa clara  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
any such loss at any of the company s facilities could disrupt its operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while the company has obtained insurance to cover most potential losses at its facilities  it cannot assure that its existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all possible losses 
risks relating to the company s location in israel conditions in israel affect the company s operations and may limit its ability to produce and sell its products 
the company is incorporated in israel and a substantial portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development facilities are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel could directly affect the company s operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
despite past progress towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
since october  there has been a significant increase in violence both in the west bank and gaza strip as well as in israel itself  and negotiations between israel and palestinian representatives have ceased 
violence in the region intensified during and the escalation of the palestinian violence in the recent months  as well as any future armed conflict  political instability or continued violence in the region  could have a negative effect on the company s business condition  harm its results of operations and adversely affect the share price of publicly traded israeli companies such as the company 
moreover  if the us war against terrorist activities centered in afghanistan is broadened to include the middle east  it could directly affect the company s business 
furthermore  several countries still restrict trade with israeli companies  and this may limit the company s ability to make sales in those countries 
these restrictions may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results  financial condition or the expansion of its business 
the company s operations could be disrupted as a result of the obligation of key personnel in israel to perform military service 
generally  all male adult citizens and permanent residents of israel under the age of are  unless exempt  obligated to perform up to days  or longer under certain circumstances  of military reserve duty annually 
additionally  all israeli residents of this age are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
many of the company s officers and employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty 
the company s operations could be disrupted by the absence for a significant period of one or more of its officers or employees due to military service 
any disruption to the company s operations could materially adversely affect the development of its business and its financial condition 
the company receives tax benefits from the israeli government that may be reduced or eliminated in the future 
the company s facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status and they are therefore eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law 
in the past  the government of israel has considered reducing or eliminating the tax benefits available to approved enterprises such as the company 
the company cannot assure that these tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
if these tax benefits were reduced or eliminated  the amount of taxes that the company pays would likely increase 
in addition  the company s approved enterprise status imposes certain requirements on it  such as the location of its manufacturing  the location of certain subcontractors and the extent to which it may outsource portions of its production process 
if the company does not meet these requirements  the law permits the authorities to cancel the tax benefits retroactively 
the government grants the company has received for research and development expenditures restrict its ability to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of israel and require the company to satisfy specified conditions 
if the company fails to satisfy these conditions  it may be required to refund grants previously received together with interest and penalties  and may be subject to criminal charges 
the company has received grants from the government of israel through the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade for the financing of a portion of its research and development expenditures in israel 
in  and  the company recorded amounts totaling  and  respectively  from the office of the chief scientist 
the terms of the chief scientist grants prohibit the company from manufacturing products or transferring technologies developed using these grants outside of israel without special approvals 
even if the company receives approval to manufacture its products outside of israel  it may be required to pay an increased total amount of royalties  which may be up to of the grant amount plus interest  depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside of israel 
this restriction may impair the company s ability to outsource manufacturing or engage in similar arrangements for those products or technologies 
in addition  if the company fails to comply with any of the conditions imposed by the office of the chief scientist  it may be required to refund any grants previously received  together with interest and penalties and may be subject to criminal charges 
in recent years  the government of israel has accelerated the rate of repayment of chief scientist grants and may further accelerate them in the future 
see item business research and development 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against the company  its officers and directors based on us securities laws claims in israel or serve process on the company s officers and directors 
the company is incorporated in israel 
many of the company s executive officers and directors are not residents of the united states  and a substantial portion of its assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult for a shareholder  or any other person or entity  to enforce a us court judgment based upon the civil liability provisions of the us securities laws in an israeli court against the company or any of these persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states 
in addition  it may be difficult to assert us securities law claims in original actions instituted in israel 
israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of us securities laws because israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim 
in addition  even if an israeli court agrees to hear a claim  it may determine that israeli law and not us law is applicable to the claim 
if us law is found to be applicable  the content of applicable us law must be proved as a fact  which can be a time consuming and costly process 
certain matters of procedure will also be governed by israeli law 
there is little binding case law in israel addressing the matters described above 
the new israeli companies law may cause uncertainties regarding corporate governance 
the new israeli companies law the companies law  which became effective on february   resulted in significant changes to israeli corporate law 
under this new law  uncertainties may arise regarding corporate governance in some areas 
for example  the law obligates a controlling shareholder  a shareholder who knows that its vote can determine the outcome of a shareholders vote and any shareholder who  under the company s articles of association  can appoint or prevent the appointment of an office holder  to act with fairness towards the company 
the companies law does not specify the substance of this duty and there is no binding case law that addresses this subject directly 
these uncertainties and others could exist until this new law has been adequately interpreted  and these uncertainties could inhibit takeover attempts or other transactions and inhibit other corporate decisions 
under current israeli law  the company may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of its former employees 
recently  israeli courts have required employers seeking to enforce non compete undertakings of a former employee to demonstrate that the competitive activities of the former employee will harm one of a limited number of material interests of the employer  which have been recognized by the courts  such as the secrecy of a company s confidential commercial information or its intellectual property 
if the company cannot demonstrate that harm would be caused to it  it may be unable to prevent its competitors from benefiting from the expertise of its former employees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio  which consists mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
the portfolio consists of low risk corporate bonds and bank deposits 
the company s policy is generally to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company has fixed rate long term debt of approximately  million 
the company believes that a material decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of this debt 
the company has foreign subsidiaries  which sell and manufacture its products in various markets 
as a result  the company s earnings and cash flows are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company attempts to limit this exposure by selling and linking its products mostly to the united states dollar 
the company also enters into foreign currency hedging transactions to protect the dollar value of its non dollar denominated trade receivables  mainly in jpy  british pounds sterling and euro 
the gains and losses on these transactions are included in the statement of operations in the period in which the changes in the exchange rate occur 
there can be no assurance that such activities or others will eliminate the negative financial impact of currency fluctuations 
indeed  such activities may have an adverse impact on earnings 
the company does not hedge transactions nor does it use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
