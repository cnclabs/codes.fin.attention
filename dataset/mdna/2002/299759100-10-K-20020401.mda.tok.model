item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we changed our fiscal year from october to december effective december  as a result  portions of the following discussion cover the two month period from november  to december  overview we develop  design and manufacture high performance rechargeable nickel zinc batteries 
we recognize revenue on the date our products are shipped as title passes to our customers in accordance with our fob shipping sales terms 
the principal markets for our batteries are the small electric vehicle market  ie scooters  neighborhood vehicles  wheelchairs  e bicycles  and marine trolling motors 
we believe that our technology offers superior performance versus traditional batteries 
while we believe that over their lives nickel zinc batteries are more economical  the initial cost of our batteries is higher than that of traditional power sources for these applications 
this initial cost has been a barrier to widespread market acceptance 
we have  through continued development  improved the performance and reduced the cost of our batteries 
it is still uncertain whether these improvements and cost reductio ns will enable us to generate sufficient revenue to justify the value of our technology 
if we do not generate sufficient revenue we may be required to revalue our technology 
we have licensed the rights to manufacture and sell nickel zinc batteries for certain specific applications in the prc and other countries in southeast asia to our joint venture in the prc  of which we own a interest 
prior to december   we accounted for our involvement in that joint venture using the equity method of accounting  in which we recorded our share of earnings or losses from that joint venture in our income statement 
subsequent to december   as a result of the joint venture agreement being formally transferred to us  we have consolidated that joint venture in our financial statements 
in a related transaction fuelcell transferred to us a interest in xiamen three circles erc technology co  ltd  tech jv 
subsequent to  but as part of the intent of  the original transfer  of the tech jv was transferred from us to dr 
chao ming huang 
the purpose of the tech jv is to enhance cooperation between china and the united states in the field of energy and other new advanced technology fields 
the tech jv has had limited activity and is not significant to our financial statements 
subsequent to the transfer  we have accounted for the tech jv using the equity method of accounting 
on february   fuelcell transferred to us the principal assets  intellectual property and liabilities related to its battery business group 
on february   fuelcell distributed to its stockholders shares of our common stock in a tax free distribution 
in april  we received million from the sale of shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to a rights offering 
results shown before the period of the spin off reflect our activity as the battery business group of fuelcell 
to continue to meet our operating and capital requirements  we completed a private placement of our equity in december  raising million  net of expenses 
we also completed a public offering of our common stock in may the public offering raised net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share additionally  we completed another public offering in february this offering raised net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we believe the net proceeds from these sales will be sufficient to support our planned operations at least through significant accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets to be held and used  including fixed assets and intangibles  are reviewed by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to result from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  and changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  the company recognizes an impairment loss  me asured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are evaluated in relation to the estimated fair value of such assets less costs to sell 
warranties and sales returns the company allows customers to return their products when they meet certain company established criteria as outlined in the company s warranty provision 
the company regularly reviews and revises when deemed necessary its estimates of sales returns based primarily upon actual returns or other events that would permit customers to return items based upon the company s warranty provisions 
the company records estimated sales returns as a reduction to sales 
returned products are recorded as inventory only if they have an expected realizable value 
the cost of refurbishment  if any  is charged to cost of sales 
actual returns  as well as realized values on returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we held no derivative instruments as of december  we are exposed to market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and repatriation  interest rates and commodity pricing 
the nature of each is as follows foreign currency exchange and repatriation we currently have international operations in the prc through our joint venture 
the currency of exchange is us dollars for all current international transactions  except for transactions of the joint venture in the prc 
although the prc controls the rate of exchange for the renminbi  a devaluation or free market valuation could impair the joint ventures ability to make payments to us 
additionally  for the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to reinvest in the prc all monies earned as net income of the joint venture 
the prc may restrict the payments under our joint venture agreement 
as a result  we might not be able to receive distributions from the joint venture in the future even if they are needed to meet obligations of our business or would be better employed in uses of our business outside of the prc 
interest rates we have invested and expect to invest excess funds in money market accounts in us and prc financial institutions 
based upon the cash and cash equivalents balance at december   an increase or decrease of interest rates of basis points would have an effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows of approximately  commodity pricing we do not hedge against price fluctuation in the commodities used in the manufacturing of our products and as a result  we are exposed to market price fluctuations for these commodities 
we will reevaluate this policy as needed commensurate with the risk inherent in the business
