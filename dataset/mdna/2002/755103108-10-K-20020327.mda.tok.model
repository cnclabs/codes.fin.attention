the poor economy in the united states was the primary reason for this decline 
the aftermarket segment recorded sales of million for the thirty nine week period ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  a reduction of million or 
the reduction is due to the loss of business at major customers 
the dry friction segment recorded sales for the period of million compared to million for the same period in the prior year  an increase of million or

successor company net sales by business segment in thousands wet friction  aftermarket  dry friction  wet friction segment in thousands net sales operating profit successor company april  through december    predecessor company april  through december    wet friction segment revenues decreased percent to million during the period april  through december  as compared with million in the same period in the prior year 
the decline was caused primarily by the low automobile production in north america as the slow economy impacted the buying patterns of consumers 
as inventory levels of automobiles increased during the period april through september  production schedules at our facilities were adjusted to reflect the changes in demand 
in the period october through december  automobile sales increased due to favorable financing packages available to consumers 
these increased sales served to reduce automobile inventory levels rather than provide for increased production at our facilities 
in addition to the impact of the poor economy in the united states  the company provided price concessions totaling 
million 
further  the loss of business in the automobile oem component of the segment reflected million of lost business due to technology changes in certain transmissions manufactured by our customer base 
this reduction was offset somewhat by providing components for the new technology 
additionally  the loss of certain business to foreign production amounted to million in reduced sales 
the remaining sales decline of million was attributed to the poor economy 
the operating profit for the thirty nine week period ended december  of million compared unfavorably to the million recorded in the same period in the prior year  a reduction of million 
the sales reduction of million for the period was the cause of the reduced operating profit 
the relationship between sales and operating profit reflects a decrease in operating profit as a percentage of reduced sales 
the company was able to maintain this ratio through cost reduction programs  which were implemented in a timely manner 
aftermarket segment in thousands net sales operating profit successor company april  through december    predecessor company april  through december    the aftermarket segment recorded sales of million for the thirty nine week period ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in sales is due to the loss of business at major customers 
in addition to the poor economy  this segment lost sales due to the acquisition of a major customer by a group which was more aligned to purchasing friction products from a major competitor of raytech 
this accounted for million in reduced sales 
further  another major customer brought in house the manufacturing of certain steel plate parts  which was reflected in reduced sales of million 
the remaining sales reduction of 
million was attributed to the poor us economy 
operating profits for the aftermarket segment for the thirty nine week period ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in the prior year  a reduction of million or 
the aftermarket segment reacted in a timely manner to the sales decline and reduced costs through an internal reorganization which streamlined certain distribution functions and also reduced costs in the manufacturing process 
dry friction segment in thousands net sales operating profit loss successor company april  through december   predecessor company april  through december   
revenues of million were recorded in the thirty nine week period ended december  compared to for the same period in the prior year  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to increased sales through the operations in china  which were opened in revenues for the china operations for the period were million compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
the revenue generated through the german operation was substantially the same as in the same period in the prior year 
the operating profits for this segment for the period of 
million compared to a loss in the same period in the prior year of 
million  an increase period over period of 
million 
this improved operating profit is attributable entirely to the increased sales through the china facility 
market conditions and outlook in developing the outlook for the year  the impact on the united states and world economies from the terrorists attack  which occurred on september   is unknown 
the us automakers have responded to the potential drop in demand with financing packages which have  through the end of  increased sales 
the impact from the terrorists attack and the retaliation by the united states will undoubtedly have an impact on the future economy  however  at this point it is not possible to quantify that impact 
the company s wet friction segment expects sales to decline in as compared to the results recorded in by an estimated 
the reduction reflects the continued slowdown in the automotive original equipment market as the united states economy recovers at a slow pace during our customers in the automotive oem are expected to continue to face competitive pressure from foreign competition from both europe and asia  which will provide increased pressure on the supplier base for continued cost reduction 
the company was successful in expanding its supplier position with general motors corporation and the new production  which will begin in the second quarter of  will offset the negative effects of both pricing and the slow economy as these issues impact the wet friction segment 
the heavy duty component of the wet friction segment is expected to decline in due to competitive pressure on pricing and the loss of certain business due to foreign production 
the markets served by this component of the wet friction segment  mainly construction  mining and agriculture  are not expected to grow significantly in  therefore  increased production is not expected 
the aftermarket segment is expected to remain at the same level as the slow economy in the united states is expected to continue to negatively offset growth for this segment 
additionally  the continued improved quality of the original equipment manufacturers has pushed out the need for replacement parts 
this trend is expected to continue in  reducing the opportunity for increased sales 
this segment continues to explore opportunities to expand its product offerings in the transmission aftermarket and will continue to explore opportunities in the dry friction segment is expected to increase revenues in over results 
the development of new market opportunities in asia is expected to continue through the planned expansion of our production facility in china 
this facility improved revenues substantially over results and is expected to continue the positive performance in the european revenues are expected to increase in due to modest growth in the overall european economy 
the company s outlook for anticipates total revenues to be at levels as well as comparative operating profits 
there are many events which could negatively impact the company s current view  including the impact of the economy worsening in the united states and in the world  the impact of the war on terrorism on the economy and the level of uncertainty perceived by the consumers in the markets the company serves 
euro conversion in january  certain member countries of the european union established irrevocable  fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency the euro 
the introduction of the euro was scheduled to be phased in over a period ending january   when euro notes and coins came into circulation 
the existing currencies were due to be completely removed from circulation on february  our company has been preparing for the introduction of the euro for several years 
the timing of our phasing out all uses of the existing currencies will comply with the legal requirements and also be scheduled to facilitate optimal coordination with the plans of our vendors  distributors and customers

the company does not believe that the fluctuation in foreign currency will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition 
additionally  the company does not enter into agreements to manage any currency transaction risks due to the immaterial amount of transactions of this type 
liquidity and capital resources the company s wet friction and dry friction operations are capital intensive and the required capital is funded through current operations and external borrowing sources 
the aftermarket operation has historically required less capital investment and has provided needed capital through current operations 
the positive cash flows provided by operations of the successor company for the period april  through december  were million 
non cash expenditures such as depreciation and amortization of million and the inventory fair value adjustments of million  and the positive changes in operating assets and liabilities of million were the most significant items that provided for positive cash flow from operating activities 
these positive cash flows offset a loss from operations of million  a deferred tax benefit of million and miscellaneous items of 
million 
the positive change in operating assets and liabilities of million is summarized as follows successor company for the period april  to dec 
 trade accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets  other long term assets accounts payable accrued liabilities  other long term liabilities  the reduction in accounts receivable of million reflects the cyclical nature of the company s business where accounts receivable are at the highest levels in the first quarter of the year and are at the lowest levels at year end 
the receivables decrease as compared to december  is million  which is more reflective of the impact on accounts receivable from reduced sales 
the inventory reduction of million reflects the impact from lower sales on inventory levels
