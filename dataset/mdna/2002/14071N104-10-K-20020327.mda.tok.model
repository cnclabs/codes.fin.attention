in connection with the rightfax  telcom technologies  commercepath and infinite technologies acquisitions  the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million  million  million and million  respectively  in january  january  october and january for the write off of purchased  in process research and development  and recorded additional amounts of goodwill that are being amortized over future years 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the company announced a new business strategy based on the mobile business solutions market 
in conjunction with this announcement the company announced the consolidation of its two primary product groups  the computer telephony software group and the document exchange software group  resulting in a reduction of its workforce and a one time charge of approximately million 
the launching of this new strategy resulted in an increase in operating expenses in over levels historically seen by the company 
the company anticipates that the process of investing in the mobile business solutions market will result in operating expenses that will continue at the levels experienced in consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring charges stock compensation expense total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales the company derives net sales primarily from initial sales of software kits and licenses and fully integrated systems  e document delivery services as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and product upgrades 
sales to resellers and distributors are recognized when the products are shipped 
the sales mix among the company s product categories and between software kits and fully integrated systems affects both net sales and gross margin 
because of their hardware components  fully integrated systems generate higher revenue per unit and lower margins than comparable software kits 
advanced cti application systems generally are sold at a higher unit price and with a higher gross margin than basic messaging systems due to the additional software modules purchased and the higher mix of software kits and software licenses as compared to fully integrated systems 
years ended december  and net sales decreased from million in to million in the company believes that the continued tightening of information technology spending and continued softness in the telephone equipment marketplace was the primary contributor to this decline in sales 
software product sales decreased over and represented of net sales 
e document delivery services decreased during and represented of net sales 
international sales decreased in  and represented of net sales 
years ended december  and net sales decreased from million in to million in all product lines experienced a decrease in sales resulting in part from an industry wide sales decline 
software product sales decreased over and represented of net sales 
e document delivery services decreased during and represented of net sales 
international sales decreased in  and represented of net sales 
in january  the company entered into an original equipment manufacturing oem agreement with cisco systems  inc with this agreement the company has granted cisco an exclusive third party license to certain enabling technology that is designed to enhance an enterprise customer s ability to migrate from legacy messaging systems to cisco s open  internet protocol ip based messaging architecture 
assuming the parties fully perform their obligations under the contract and payments are made as scheduled through mid  in accordance with applicable software revenue recognition rules  the company expects to recognize revenue of approximately  in and million in  with the remainder of the revenue associated with the quarterly payments recognized in and see footnote to the financial statements 
gross profit years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in compared to in  reflecting the fixed portion of production costs on lower sales volumes and the impact of technology changes on our inventory 
years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in compared to in  evidencing the continuing shift to higher margin products in the software products area 
research and development years ended december  and research and development expenses in increased to million from million in reflecting the company s investment in new product offerings  including infinite mobile delivery and new versions of callxpress and rightfax  all of which were released in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses represented of sales in  as compared to in the company anticipates research and development spending to remain at approximately the same level in as in years ended december  and research and development expenses in decreased to million from million in reflecting stable headcount for both years 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses represented of sales in  as compared to in selling  general and administrative years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due in part to the marketing expenditures related to our corporate branding initiative coinciding with the company s name change to captaris  added headcount resulting from our acquisition of infinite technologies and increased international expansion 
amortization of goodwill relating to acquisitions in the amounts of million and million was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in  as compared to in the company anticipates selling  general and administrative spending to remain relatively constant in years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due to our continuing development of our enterprise and international sales channels across our software product line 
amortization of goodwill relating to acquisitions in the amount of million was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in both and selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in  as compared to in non recurring charges in the first quarter of  the company recorded a non recurring charge of million for acquired in process research and development related to the acquisition of infinite technologies in january 
also during the first quarter of  the company recorded non recurring charges of million related primarily to the consolidation of the tucson and kirkland operations 
in the fourth quarter of the company consolidated its rightfax and commercepath divisions into the document exchange software group 
as a result of this consolidation the company incurred expenses of  during the quarter of which  was a non cash charge related to stock compensation 
on april  the company merged with mediatel corporation in a tax free  stock for stock transaction valued at approximately million 
the combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests and all amounts have been adjusted to reflect this transaction 
related to this merger  the company incurred merger related expenses of million during the second quarter of during the first quarter of  the company expects to record non recurring charges of approximately million related to the reduction in workforce executed on january  other income  net for the years ended december   and  other income increased from million in and decreased from million in to million in included in other income for was a non recurring gain of million relating to the sale of marketable securities held for investment 
income tax expense the effective income tax rates in  and were  and respectively 
the company recognized an income tax benefit of million in and expense of million in and million in net income and net income per share years ended december  and the company reported a net loss of million in as compared to net income of million in excluding the nonrecurring charges related to the acquisition of infinite technologies in january  the costs incurred in the first quarter consolidation of our kirkland and tucson operations  and the fourth quarter variable accounting charge for stock compensation expense  the net loss would have been million for diluted net loss per share  excluding the nonrecurring items  was per share in from

per share in from 
per share in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december  from million at december  and increased from million at december  the decrease in was directly attributable to the cash expended in the acquisition of infinite technologies in january  as well as the expenditure of million to repurchase the company s stock under the company s stock repurchase program 
cash flow generated from operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in august of the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million worth of its common stock 
during approximately million of the authorized funds were expended to repurchase approximately  shares in addition to  that was spent in to purchase approximately  shares 
the program is ongoing  although the timing and size of repurchases  if any  are subject to market conditions  stock prices  and captaris cash position and requirements going forward 
on january   the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of infinite technologies  a privately held global supplier of wireless applications and wireless infrastructure solutions for a total consideration of up to  at closing  the company paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of the company s common stock valued at  the company will pay approximately  in a combination of cash and the company s common stock under a deferred payment arrangement over the next three years  which was recorded at the time of closing as a note payable of  net of imputed interest  and stock to be issued totaling  in addition  the company may pay up to an additional  in a combination of cash and the company s common stock under an earn out arrangement over a period of three years from the date of closing which will be expensed as compensation by the company 
the company invested million  million and million in equipment and leasehold improvements in the years ended december   and  respectively 
equipment purchases in such years consisted primarily of computer hardware and software 
the company expects that its current cash  cash flow from operations and available bank line of credit  will provide sufficient working capital for operations for the foreseeable future 
commercial commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years after year years long term debt    operating leases     at december   the company had a million unsecured revolving line of credit  none of which was used during the years ended december  and the company s line of credit expires in august  and contains certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters  including the company s ability to pay cash dividends without the bank s prior approval 
the company is currently in compliance with such financial covenants and restrictions 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate or  at the company s option  its interbank offering rate plus 
at december   the bank s prime rate was  and its interbank offering rate was 
critical accounting policies we have identified the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments 
our most critical accounting policies relate to the following areas 
revenue recognition  
allowances for returns and warranty obligations  
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  
contingencies  and 
income taxes revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
these guidelines require that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to resellers are generally recognized when related products are shipped  provided fees are fixed and determinable and collection is deemed probable 
in instances where the company has an installation obligation  revenue is recognized when product installation is complete 
costs related to insignificant customer support obligations  which include telephone support  are accrued at the time the related revenue is recorded as are estimated returns  which have not been significant 
revenues from software maintenance agreements are recognized over the contract periods  generally one year  on a straight line basis 
revenues from document delivery services are recognized when services are provided 
sales returns and the allowance for obsolete and damaged inventory 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the allowance for sales returns amounted to  at december   compared to  at december  the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or damage equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets following the guidance of sfas when doing so  management is required to estimate undiscounted cash flows to assess the recoverability of those assets 
there is a risk that projected cash flow will be less than actual cash flow  particularly related to its mobile delivery products which compete in an emerging market 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in an asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  contingencies 
the company is periodically involved in litigation or claims  including patent infringements claims  in the normal course of its business 
management follows the provisions of statements of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies to record litigation or claim related expenses 
under this criteria  the company accrues for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to management s judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims  which could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from estimates 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by sfas accounting for income taxes and related interpretations 
the company is required to estimate the effective tax rate on a quarterly basis and annual basis which will differ from the statutory rate due to permanent differences between taxable income and net income or loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
when estimating the effective tax rate for a quarter  management is required to project pretax income or loss for the year and the impact of permanent differences such as tax exempt interest income  goodwill amortization and foreign income exclusions and other items 
actual amounts for the year may differ from management s estimates 
in addition  the impact of such items on the effective rate become proportionately bigger as income or loss approaches the breakeven level 
new accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board approved statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june  the amortization of existing goodwill will cease on december  any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june  will not be amortized 
sfas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the adoption of sfas no 
will result in the company s discontinuation of amortization of its goodwill  however  the company will be required to test its goodwill for impairment under the new standard beginning in the first quarter of  which could have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations if an impairment occurs 
at december   the company had net goodwill of approximately million which will be evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
and recorded related amortization expense of  for the year 
management is currently evaluating what impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the company 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for the company on january  this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and other related accounting guidance 
the company does not believe that this statement will have an impact on its financial statements 
stock based compensation during the second quarter of  the company offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one for one basis 
the exchange which closed on july  resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than per share in exchange for  employee stock options with an exercise price of 
the option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of  options  representing the  new options granted in the exchange as well as any stock options granted to participating employees within the six months before or after the exchange that have an exercise price less than the tendered stock options to the extent the employee s new grant was for fewer shares than the shares subject to the tendered options 
variable accounting will continue until all options subject to variable accounting treatment are exercised  cancelled or expired 
variable accounting treatment will result in charges or credits  recorded to stock based compensation  dependent on unpredictable fluctuations in quoted prices for the company s common stock 
the closing stock price of the company s stock at december  was  which resulted in a charge of  being recorded as stock compensation expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of interest bearing securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
because the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  it does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company has assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to the company s international sales operations 
the company has not hedged its translation risk on these currencies as the company has the ability to hold its foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and does not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
additional factors that may affect our business  future operating results and financial condition the following factors may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event the trading price of our shares could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment  therefore  you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
our recently expanded business strategy to focus on the mobile business solutions market  which is a new and unproven market  may not be successful 
in march  we announced that we are expanding our business strategy to focus on the mobile business solutions market  which we believe is a higher growth opportunity in our market 
in order to implement this strategy  we will be required to design  develop and introduce competitive new wireless products  improve our marketing of such products and build credibility among customers that we are capable of delivering advanced mobile business solutions 
implementation of this strategy will involve substantial increased costs and  as a result  our expenses will increase disproportionately to revenue in the near term 
moreover  implementation of this strategy may disrupt our existing operations and distract management  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that we will realize a return on our investment in the new and unproven mobile business solutions market 
if we are not successful in implementing our strategy  our revenue could decline 
even if we are successful  our revenue may still decrease if the market opportunity for mobile wireless solutions does not develop in the ways we anticipate 
this market opportunity is in its early stages and certain early entrants have not achieved their publicly forecasted financial results 
we cannot guarantee that the demand for mobile business solutions will develop as fast as we anticipate  that new technologies will not cause the market to evolve in a manner different from what we expect or that we will be able to obtain a leadership position as this market opportunity develops 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter  which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
because of these fluctuations  our operating results for a particular quarter may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our stock may decline 
such fluctuations could cause period to period comparisons to be less than meaningful 
numerous factors contribute to the unpredictability of our operating results  including 
the timing of customer orders  
changes in our mix of products and distribution channels  
the announcement or introduction of new products by us or our competitors  
pricing pressures  and 
general economic conditions 
most of our software product revenue comes from current quarter orders and sales  of which a substantial portion  and sometimes a majority  occurs in the last month of each quarter 
we do not maintain a large backlog of orders  and most of our distributors maintain little or no inventory 
order fulfillment cycles are typically short  and often as short as one to two days 
accordingly  the timing of customer orders can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
because we sell our products to end customers through various third parties such as telephone system manufacturers  value added resellers  telephone interconnect resellers  and others  we are unable to project with certainty the actual orders  sales  and revenues these third parties will generate in a given quarter 
the combination of these factors impairs and delays our ability to know when revenues and earnings will be higher or lower than expected 
we base product development and other operating expenses on our expected revenues 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust our spending in time to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in quarterly revenues 
our operating results may vary by season  which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of seasonal factors  and this may cause our operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors for a particular quarter 
specifically  due to typical year end dealer sales patterns and end user buying patterns  net sales in our first quarter  without taking into account the effect of acquisitions  have in the past declined from the fourth quarter of the previous year 
we rely heavily on telephone system manufacturers  independent equipment resellers and value added resellers 
a substantial majority of our net sales depends on a network of independent telephone equipment resellers and computer oriented value added resellers 
there is intense competition for the attention of these independent resellers from our competitors and from providers of other products distributed through these channels 
many of these resellers do not have the financial resources to withstand a downturn in their businesses 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our network of resellers in the future 
moreover  our resellers may not maintain or expand their present level of efforts to sell our products 
if we lose a major dealer or reseller  or if our dealers and resellers lose interest in selling our products  our business  results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
failure to establish and maintain strategic relationships could limit our ability to increase sales 
creation and maintenance of strategic relationships is important to our success because these relationships enable us to market and distribute our products to a larger customer base than we could otherwise reach through our director marketing efforts 
we currently have strategic relationships with ericsson  nec corporation  fujitsu limited  lotus development corporation  xerox corporation and others 
however  we may not be successful in creating new strategic relationships on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  although we view our strategic relationships as an important factor in the successful commercialization of our products and services  our current strategic partners may not view their relationships with us as significant for their own businesses and any one them could reassess their commitment to us in the future 
further  our relationships are generally non exclusive  which means our strategic partners may develop relationships with some of our competitors 
failure of one or more of our strategic partners to successfully develop and sustain a market for our services  or the termination of one or more of our strategic relationships could adversely affect our ability to increase sales 
the integration of recent and any future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive 
we frequently evaluate potential acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
since january  we have made five strategic acquisitions including the january acquisition of infinite technologies 
our recent and any future acquisitions may direct management s attention away from the day to day operations of our business and may pose numerous other risks 
for instance  we may not be able to successfully integrate any technologies  products  personnel or operations of companies that we may acquire 
in making acquisitions  we may need to make dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incur debt  write off purchased  in process research and development and amortize expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our industry 
in our industry  technology and customer demands change rapidly  and we and our competitors frequently introduce new products and features 
to succeed  we must identify  develop and market new products  features and services that achieve broad market acceptance by satisfying those changing customer needs and keeping pace with those technological developments 
to do this  we must spend substantial funds on product development 
we regularly devote significant resources to technologies that we anticipate will be widely adopted 
in addition  in the future  we intend to pursue new revenue streams by leveraging our expertise in voice and data communication to integrate these capabilities in unified messaging and mobile wireless delivery  among other possible areas 
the market for unified messaging software and mobile wireless delivery is relatively new and  as yet  unproven 
to be successful  we must  among other things  develop and market products and services that achieve broad market acceptance 
we may not be able to develop new products or product enhancements on a timely basis 
even if we do  the market may not accept the new products or product enhancements that we develop 
our market is highly competitive 
the computer telephony market is highly competitive 
moreover  we believe the competitive pressures we face are likely to intensify  particularly as our competitors make new offerings based on the windows operating system 
we may not have the financial resources  marketing  distribution and service capability  depth of key personnel or technological knowledge to continue to compete successfully in each of our markets 
we believe the main competitive factors affecting our business are breadth and quality of application software  product integration  ability to respond to technological change  quality of a company s sales force  price  size of the installed base  level of customer support and professional services 
in the telephony oriented market for messaging systems  our principal competitors are independent suppliers such as avaya  inc  mitel corporation  active voice inc now a division of nec america  inc  cisco systems  inc 
and callware technologies  inc in addition to independent suppliers of computer telephony solutions  we also compete with private branch exchange and key telephone systems manufacturers 
those manufacturers offer integrated voice messaging systems  unified messaging systems and automatic call distribution systems of their own design or under various oem agreements 
competitors in this category include lucent technologies  inc  nortel networks corporation  siemens business communication systems  inc  mitel corporation and nec america  inc 
in the market for lan based facsimile systems  our principal competitors are omtool  ltd  optus software  inc  esker  sa and computer associates international  inc our fax server products also compete with vendors offering a range of alternative facsimile solutions  including operating systems containing facsimile and document transmission features  low end fax modem products  desktop fax software  single platform facsimile software products and customized proprietary software solutions 
in the market for production facsimile systems  our principal competitors are biscom  inc  esker  sa and topcall international ag 
in the market for document distribution products  our principal competitors include the xpedite division of ptek holdings  inc and other telecommunications providers such as cable wireless  inc the competitors of our newly acquired infinite technologies include openwave systems  inc  aether systems  inc 
and solutions  inc 
further acceptance of open systems architectures and the development of industry standards in the call processing market may eliminate some of the technical barriers to entry  allowing additional competitors to enter the market 
many of our existing competitors have larger customer and installed bases and substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors have a marketing advantage because they can sell their call processing equipment or facsimile solutions as part of their broader product offerings 
recently  we believe our business has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected by the introduction of next generation ip pbx switches as potential customers delay purchasing decisions as they evaluate these new product offerings 
we expect our competitors will continue to offer improved product technologies and capabilities 
the availability of these products could cause sales of our existing products to decline 
for these reasons  we may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
our average sales prices have declined for some of our products 
the average sales prices in our basic voice messaging products have declined due to competitive pressures 
in the future  prices may decline in some of our other product lines 
if the average sales prices of our more significant product lines fall  our overall gross margins will likely fall 
to offset and forestall declining average sales prices  we must continue to develop product enhancements and new products with advanced features that are likely to generate higher margin incremental revenue 
if we are unable to do so in a timely manner or if our products do not achieve significant customer acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
additionally  we have experienced  as have others in our broadcast fax and document delivery markets  pricing pressures for our services 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights 
to succeed  we must adequately protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other agreements  and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology  but those measures may be insufficient 
we have one patent in the area of unified messaging  but our competitors may challenge or circumvent the claims in that patent 
our current patent  or any future patents  may never provide us with any competitive advantages 
other measures that we take to protect our proprietary technology may not prevent or deter misappropriation of our technology or the development of technologies with similar characteristics 
moreover  our use of open systems architecture in the design of our products may make it easier for competitors to misappropriate or replicate our designs and developments 
other companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property or proprietary rights  which could cause us to incur significant expenses or be prevented from selling our products 
our success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
historically  competitors in the computer telephony software industry have filed numerous allegations of patent infringement  resulting in considerable litigation 
we have received claims of patent infringement from several parties and will probably receive additional claims in the future 
any litigation  regardless of our success  would probably be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
litigation could also force us to 
stop or delay selling  or using  products that use the challenged intellectual property  
pay damages for infringement  
obtain licenses  which may be unavailable on acceptable terms  or 
redesign products or services that use the infringing technology 
we face risks from expansion of our international operations 
our growth depends  in part on continued expansion of our international sales 
international sales generated approximately  and of our net sales in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have spent significant management attention and financial resources on our international operations 
a significant portion of our revenues are subject to the risks associated with international sales  which include 
difficulty adapting products to local languages and telephone system technology  
inability to respond to changes in regulatory requirements  
inability to meet special standards requirements  
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  
potentially adverse tax consequences  and 
uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries are uncertain or do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the united states 
moreover  we could be sued for patent infringement or other intellectual property violations in a foreign country where it could be very costly to defend such a lawsuit 
currently  substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
increases in the value of the dollar against local currency could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to reduced sales or profitability in that country 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we expect our non dollar denominated sales and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
we do not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations  but we may do so in the future 
we may not be able to hire and retain highly skilled employees  which could affect our ability to compete effectively 
to succeed  we must attract and retain key personnel in engineering  research and development  marketing  sales  finance and administration 
in particular  as we implement our recently announced strategy of focusing on mobile business solutions  we will need to hire employees with experience developing and providing wireless products and services 
we also depend to a significant degree on the efforts of our senior management team 
if we fail to recruit such personnel or lose the services of existing key persons in any functional area  our current operations and new product development efforts could be adversely affected 
competition for skilled personnel is intense 
when our stock price is lower than our employees stock option price  it is particularly difficult to retain skilled personnel 
we do not maintain material key person life insurance 
we may experience difficulties in managing our growth 
growth in our business has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management and operations 
to succeed  our officers and key employees must manage growth successfully 
we must continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems 
in addition  we must expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may be unable to successfully accomplish these tasks in a timely manner 
we depend on third parties for certain key components of our products 
we use standard computer hardware for our products 
most of the components we use are readily available 
however  only three domestic suppliers can provide voice processing circuit boards in the quantities we need 
in addition  only two domestic suppliers can provide our facsimile processing circuit boards in the quantity we require 
historically  we have relied almost exclusively on dialogic corporation now a part of intel corporation for our voice cards  and on dialogic and brooktrout  inc for our fax cards 
we rely on those suppliers primarily because of volume price discounts and the cost and effort required to develop software for an alternate voice or fax card 
significant delays  interruptions or reductions in our supply of voice or fax cards  or unfavorable changes to price and delivery terms could adversely affect our business 
our stock price may be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
the future price of the common stock will fluctuate in response to factors such as 
new product announcements or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  
quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  
announcements of technical innovations  
announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  
changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  and 
general conditions in the computer telephony market 
in addition  the market prices of securities issued by many companies  particularly in high technology industries  are volatile for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock
