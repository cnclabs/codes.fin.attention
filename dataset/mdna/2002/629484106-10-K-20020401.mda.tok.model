these critical accounting policies include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of investments 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on individual case estimates for losses reported 
a provision is also included  based on actuarial estimates utilizing historical trends in the frequency and severity of paid and reported claims  for losses incurred but not reported  salvage and subrogation recoveries and for loss adjustment expenses 
unpaid losses with respect to asbestos environmental risks are difficult for management to estimate and require considerable judgment due to the uncertainty regarding the significant issues surrounding such claims

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to reasonably possible changes in the fair value of financial instruments which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the largest market risk to the company relates to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
this risk is considered when developing benchmarks for evaluating the company s portfolio 
such benchmarks also consider the overall duration of the company s loss reserves 
through the matching of cash flows from future maturing investments and the ultimate payout pattern of loss reserves  the company believes it can minimize the effect of interest rate risk 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
taxables also include mortgage backed securities that have prepayment features which may cause actual cash flows to differ from those based on maturity date 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempts average interest rate taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
the company s investment guidelines are conservatively designed and prevent the investment in securities below a baa rating 
overall  the company maintains fixed maturities with an average credit quality rating of aa as of december  the company s exposure to credit risk is considered minimal 
foreign currency risk includes exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on the market value and interest income of foreign denominated investments 
mmo london operations maintains cash and investments in british pounds sterling with a us equivalent of  to the extent business is derived from transactions in such currency 
the investment of cash flows from business written in pounds sterling in securities of the same foreign currency should ultimately mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to british pounds sterling 
equity risk includes the potential loss from changes in the fair value of equity securities 
the company s equity securities are traded on major stock exchanges and are highly liquid 
the investment in such securities are limited by the company s investment guidelines to of statutory surplus in order to minimize the impact of large changes in the stock market on its surplus 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with investment advisors  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines  the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the portfolio
