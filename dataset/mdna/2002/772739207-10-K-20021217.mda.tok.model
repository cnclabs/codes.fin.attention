item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations segment and market information we report our results in three industry segments packaging products  merchandising displays and corrugated packaging  and paperboard 
no single external customer accounts for more than of our consolidated net sales 
during fiscal  the top ten customers represented approximately of our consolidated net sales 
the packaging products segment consists of facilities that produce folding cartons  interior packaging and thermoformed plastic packaging 
we compete with national  regional and local packaging suppliers operating in north america 
during fiscal  we sold packaging products to approximately  customers and the top ten customers accounted for approximately of the external sales of the packaging products segment 
we sell packaging products to customers in a variety of industries including customers in the food and beverage industries and to manufacturers of other non durable goods 
the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment consists of facilities that produce merchandising displays and flexographic and litho laminated corrugated packaging 
we compete with a number of national  regional and local suppliers of those goods in this segment 
during fiscal  we sold display products to approximately customers and corrugated packaging products to approximately customers 
the top ten customers of the segment accounted for approximately of external sales 
the paperboard segment consists of facilities that collect recovered paper and that manufacture recycled clay coated and specialty paperboard  corrugating medium  and laminated paperboard products 
in our clay coated and specialty paperboard divisions  we compete with integrated and non integrated companies operating in north america manufacturing various grades of paperboard as well as a limited amount of paperboard imported by manufacturers outside of north america 
in our laminated paperboard products division  we compete with a small number of national  regional and local companies offering highly specialized products 
we also compete with foreign companies in the book cover market 
our recycled fiber division competes with national  regional and local companies 
during fiscal  we sold recycled paperboard  corrugating medium  laminated paperboard products and recovered paper to approximately  customers and the top ten external customers of the segment represented approximately of external sales 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of our segment sales were made to internal customers  predominantly in our packaging products segment 
our paperboard segment s sales volumes may therefore be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products 
all of our businesses are highly competitive 
we regularly bid for sales opportunities to customers for new business or for renewal of existing business 
the loss of business or the award of new business from our larger customers may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
our ability to fully pass through fiber price increases can be limited based on competitive market conditions for various products that we sell and by the actions of our competitors 
in addition  most of our paperboard and paperboard based converted products are sold pursuant to term contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms  or provide for price adjustments based on changes in specified paperboard index prices 
the effect of these contractual provisions generally is to either limit the amount or delay our ability to recover announced price increases for paperboard 
in july  smurfit stone container corporation  a customer for whom we provided approximately  tons of paperboard annually for use in tube and core manufacturing  announced the sale of of its tube and core manufacturing facilities to caraustar industries  inc as a result  caraustar industries  inc plans to increase its sales of paperboard to these newly acquired facilities 
we believe we will be able to shift a significant portion of the volume of paperboard sold to smurfit stone container corporation to other tube and core manufacturers and  therefore  do not expect a material impact on our operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers financial condition  our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future 
inventory 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
we periodically evaluate fixed assets and goodwill for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
consulting actuaries and administrators assist us in determining our liability for self insured claims 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our income tax exposure 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels 
during fiscal  the effect of a point change in the discount rate would have impacted income before income taxes by approximately million 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense  
table of contents recorded obligation and funding requirements in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
the following table shows certain operating data for our three industry segments 
certain of our income and expenses are not allocated to our segments and are thus not reflected in the information used by management to make operating decisions and assess performance 
these items are reported as non allocated expenses 
these include elimination of intersegment profit  plant closing and related expenses and certain corporate expenses

for additional discussion of quarterly information  see our quarterly reports on form q filed with the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents net sales unaffiliated customers net sales for fiscal decreased to  million from  million for fiscal net sales decreased as a result of weaker market conditions in our paperboard businesses and the impact of lower paperboard prices on our paperboard and converting businesses 
these results were partially offset by volume increases in the merchandising display business 
net sales for fiscal decreased to  million from  million for fiscal net sales decreased as a result of decreased volumes in specialty paperboard and laminated paperboard products as well as price decreases in recycled fiber 
these price and volume declines were partially offset by price and volume increases in displays and plastic packaging

the decline in sales prices reflected in part the pass through of lower costs for paperboard 
the increase in net sales of the packaging products segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of increased prices and volumes in our plastic packaging business offset by lower volumes in our interior packaging business

table of contents net sales aggregate by division merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment merchandising displays corrugated packaging in millions the increase in net sales of the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of higher volumes in our merchandising display business  including the benefit of two major product launches on behalf of major national consumer products companies as well as two acquisitions made during fiscal these results were partially offset by lower volumes in our corrugated packaging business due to generally weaker market conditions 
the increase in net sales of the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of increased volumes and increases in pricing of displays offset by lower volumes in our corrugated packaging business due to generally weaker market conditions

reduced volumes at our interior packaging business over fiscal further contributed to the sales decline 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales in our recycled fiber business due to an increase in fiber prices during the last half of fiscal the decrease in net sales of the paperboard segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of a significant decline in recycled fiber prices as well as volume declines due to a general weakening in the book and ready to assemble furniture industries 
reduced volumes at our interior packaging business over fiscal further contributed to the sales decline

substantially all of our us inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation method  which we believe generally results in a better matching of current costs and revenues than under the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
in periods of increasing costs  the lifo method generally results in higher cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
in periods of decreasing costs  the results are generally the opposite 
the following table illustrates the comparative effect of lifo and fifo accounting on our results of operations 
these supplemental fifo earnings reflect the after tax effect of eliminating the lifo adjustment each year 
lifo fifo lifo fifo lifo fifo in millions cost of goods sold net income loss our ability to work as an integrated business  as opposed to different units  has given us opportunities to reduce production overhead costs and to take advantage of economies of scale in purchasing  customer service  freight and other areas common to all of our facilities 
our newest initiative to reduce our variable manufacturing and transactional costs is the introduction of a company wide six sigma process during fiscal six sigma is a process improvement methodology that has a relentless focus on customer needs and delivering significant bottom line results

acquisitions during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of athena industries  inc  a designer and manufacturer of permanent point of purchase displays and fixtures with expertise in wire and metal fabrication located in burr ridge  illinois  and certain assets of advertising display company  inc  a producer of temporary and permanent point of purchase displays  including its display operations in memphis  tennessee 
the results of operations of athena industries and advertising display company have been included in our consolidated statements of operations after march  and november   respectively  the dates of acquisition 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  these acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  which requires that we record the assets and liabilities of the acquisitions at their estimated fair value with the excess of the purchase price over these amounts recorded as goodwill 
total cash consideration paid for the acquisitions was million 
additional contingent cash consideration of up to an aggregate of million may be paid based on the achievement of gross profit goals through calendar year final adjustments to the purchase price will be made based on finalization of the amount of working capital acquired 
estimated goodwill of approximately million  which is deductible for tax purposes  was recorded in connection with the acquisitions in our merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment 
the pro forma impact of the acquisitions is not material to the financial results for the year ended september  plant closing and other costs during fiscal  we incurred plant closing and other costs related to announced facility closings 
we generally accrue the cost of employee terminations at the time of notification to the employees 
certain other costs  such as moving and relocation costs  are expensed as incurred 
these plant closing costs include the closing of a laminated paperboard products plant in vineland  new jersey  a corrugating plant in dothan  alabama and a folding carton plant in el paso  texas 
the closures resulted in the termination of approximately employees 
in connection with these closings  we incurred charges of million during fiscal which consisted mainly of asset impairment  severance  equipment relocation  disposal costs and related expenses 
payments of million were made during fiscal the remaining liability at september  is approximately million 
plant closing and other costs are not allocated to the respective segments for financial reporting purposes 
had these costs been allocated  million would have been charged to the packaging products segment  million would have been charged to the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment  and million would have been charged to the paperboard segment

sales of laminated paperboard products declined due to a decrease in demand by customers in the book and ready to assemble furniture industries 
the reduced sales volumes of laminated paperboard products contributed to the decline in operating income of our specialty paperboard division  however  the decline was partially offset by improvements resulting from our gypsum linerboard joint venture 
operating income in our coated paperboard division declined due to lower pricing and a longer and more costly than expected capital improvement shutdown of our battle creek mill 
the decreases in operating margin of our mills were also attributable to rising fiber prices during the last half of fiscal that were not fully passed through to customers  but were partially offset by lower energy prices

we anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures  interest payments  stock repurchases  dividends and working capital needs for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional long term debt financing 
in october  our board of directors approved a resolution to increase our quarterly dividend to per share  or per year  on our class a common stock 
we believe that this increase was warranted by the reduction in our debt levels over the past two years and our lower level of expected capital expenditures in relation to the cash flows that our business has been generating

new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement applies to all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
we will adopt this accounting standard for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december

forward looking statements statements herein regarding  among other things  estimated capital expenditures for fiscal and expected expenditures for environmental compliance  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual amounts to differ materially from those projected 
with respect to these forward looking statements  management has made assumptions regarding  among other things  the amount and timing of expected capital expenditures  the estimated cost of compliance with environmental laws  the expected resolution of various pending environmental matters and competitive conditions in our businesses and general economic conditions 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks including  among others  that the amount of capital expenditures has been underestimated and that the impact on our results of those capital expenditures has been overestimated  the cost of compliance with environmental laws has been underestimated  and expected outcomes of various pending environmental matters are inaccurate 
in addition  our performance in future periods is subject to other risks including  among others  decreases in demand for our products  increases in raw material costs  fluctuations in selling prices and adverse changes in general market and industry conditions 
we believe these estimates are reasonable  however  undue reliance should not be placed on such estimates  which are based on current expectations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
to mitigate these risks  we enter into various hedging transactions 
the sensitivity analyses presented below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the economy generally  nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
derivative instruments we enter into a variety of derivative transactions 
we use interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt 
we use forward contracts to limit exposure to fluctuations in canadian foreign currency rates with respect to our 
table of contents receivables denominated in canadian dollars 
we also use commodity swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling sales prices and rising raw material costs 
for each derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings during the period of the changes in fair values 
for each derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is recognized in current earnings during the period of change 
gains or losses on the termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense of the related debt instrument over the remaining term of the original contract life of the terminated swap agreements 
for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments  the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change 
fair value of cash flow hedges are included in other long term liabilities and other assets on the balance sheet 
during fiscal  we realized cash proceeds of million by terminating the interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and entering into comparable replacement interest rate swaps at then current market levels 
no material impact on net income or change in interest rate risk is expected from these transactions relative to our position prior to entering into these transactions 
interest rate we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
from time to time  we use interest rate agreements effectively to cap the libor rate on the variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
if market interest rates averaged more than actual rates in  our interest expense  after considering the effects of interest rate swap and cap agreements  would have increased and income before taxes would have decreased by approximately million 
comparatively  if market interest rates averaged more than actual rates in fiscal  our interest expense  after considering the effects of interest rate swap agreements  would have increased and income before taxes would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap and cap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
we principally use forward contracts to limit exposure to fluctuations in canadian foreign currency rates  our largest exposure 
for fiscal  a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency in which our sales are denominated would have resulted in an increase in gross profit of million for fiscal comparatively  for fiscal  a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency in which our sales are denominated would have resulted in an increase in gross profit of million for fiscal this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effect of changes in exchange rates on the dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 

table of contents commodities we sell recycled medium to various customers 
the principal raw material used in the production of medium is old corrugated containers  or occ 
medium prices and occ costs fluctuate widely due to changing market forces 
as a result  we make use of swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling selling prices and rising raw material costs of a portion of our recycled medium business 
we estimate market risk as a hypothetical decrease in selling prices or a increase in raw material costs 
with the effect of our medium swaps  such a decrease would have resulted in lower sales of million during fiscal with the effect of our occ swaps  such an increase would have resulted in higher costs of purchases of million during fiscal in  we estimated market risk as a hypothetical decrease in selling prices or a increase in raw material costs 
with the effect of our medium swaps  such a decrease would have resulted in lower sales of million during fiscal with the effect of our occ swaps  such an increase would have resulted in higher costs of purchases of million during fiscal we purchase and sell a variety of commodities that are not subject to derivative commodity instruments  including occ  paperboard and recovered paper 
fluctuations in market prices of these commodities could have a material effect on our results of operations 
such fluctuations are not reflected in the results above
