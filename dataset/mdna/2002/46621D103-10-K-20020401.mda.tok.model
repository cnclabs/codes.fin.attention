item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in this annual report 
in particular  for information regarding the company s operations in different industry segments and geographic locations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  investment impairments  goodwill impairments  loss contingencies  and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
the company utilizes credit insurance to minimize the risk of loss from non payment of us customer receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness  and if balances exceed insured limits  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be adversely affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined primarily on the basis of management s best estimate of probable losses  including specific allowances for known troubled accounts 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for its products  the company may be required to record adjustments in order to reflect the inventory at the lower of cost or market  and the gross margin could be adversely affected 
other investments are primarily investments in partnerships 
jlm accounts for the majority of its investments in partnerships on the equity basis and  accordingly  records its respective share of profits and losses that are allocated in accordance with the partnership agreements 
changes in market conditions could result in investment impairment 
the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and investments  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value cannot be recovered from undiscounted future cash flows 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  the company may strategically realign resources and consider restructuring or disposing of businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
when the book value of an intangible asset exceeds associated expected future operating cash flows  it is considered to be impaired and is written down to fair value  which is determined based on either future cash flows or appraised values 
jlm is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
jlm considers the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability as well as jlm s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired  and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
jlm regularly evaluates information currently available to the company to determine whether such losses should be recorded 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
jlm accounts for us income taxes and accrues for us income tax liabilities based on its consolidated us earnings 
the company s foreign subsidiaries file tax returns in the countries where incorporated 
to the extent these subsidiaries are profitable  taxes are paid based on each country s prevailing tax rate 
upon repatriation of non us earnings  the non us allows a foreign tax credit  subject to certain limitations  to be applied against the company s us consolidated return for the foreign taxes paid by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
if losses are incurred  countries in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are incorporated generally allow the losses to be carried forward and applied against income earned in subsequent years 
the company s future effective tax rates and realization of carry forward losses could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where there are lower statutory rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws or regulations 
general jlm is a leading marketer and distributor of certain commodity chemicals  principally acetone and phenol 
the company believes it is the sixth largest chemical distributor in north america 
jlm is also a global distributor of olefins  principally propylene  as well as a variety of other commodity and specialty chemicals 
in order to provide stable and reliable sources of supply for its products  the company i maintains established supplier relationships with several major chemical companies  ii manufactures phenol and acetone and iii sources acetone from its joint venture manufacturing operation 
the company s business consists of manufacturing and marketing segments 
the company s manufacturing segment includes the operations of the blue island plant 
the company s marketing segment includes its distribution  storage and terminaling operations and all other sourcing operations 
a majority of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of commodity chemicals  prices for which are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
the company endeavors to enter into supply contracts that provide a fixed percentage profit per unit of product sold 
during the second half of through the first quarter  the company s performance was negatively impacted by the petrochemical down cycle in which both overall pricing and margins accelerated downward 
pricing pressure on manufactured products  specifically phenol  continued during the period coupled with substantial increases in raw material feedstock costs 
beginning in the second quarter  major us phenol acetone producers  including the company  announced price increases that became effective april  in addition  raw materials costs began dropping in the second half of raw material pricing has continued to decline in  leading to some recovery of the company s operating margins 
set forth below  for the periods indicated  is certain information regarding the contributions by the marketing and manufacturing segments to the company s revenues  gross profit  operating income  gross margin and operating margin 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
as a percentage of segment revenues years ended december  gross profit marketing manufacturing total gross profit segment operating income loss marketing manufacturing total segment operating income loss year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenues marketing    manufacturing    total revenues    gross profit marketing    manufacturing    total gross profit    segment operating income loss marketing   manufacturing    total segment operating loss  corporate expense    total operating loss    marketing segment the marketing segment revenues are influenced largely by the volume of new and existing products sold by the company 
the volume of products sold depends on a number of factors  including strength in the homebuilding and automobile industries and the overall economic environment 
the company s supply agreements  primarily relating to acetone  frequently contain a term providing for a fixed percentage profit per unit of product sold 
in addition  the company s supplier and customer contracts have a provision permitting the company to purchase or sell additional product at the company s option  typically plus or minus of the contractual volume amount 
as a result  during a period of pricing volatility  the company has the opportunity to improve its profitability by exercising the appropriate option to either build inventory in a rising price environment or to sell product for future delivery in a declining price environment 
manufacturing segment the results of operations of the company s manufacturing segment are influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  competition and the cost of raw materials  principally propylene and benzene 
the company s ability to pass along raw material price increases to its customers is limited because the commodity nature of the chemicals manufactured at the blue island plant restricts the company s ability to increase prices 
the development of financial instruments to hedge against changes in the prices of propylene and benzene has occurred in the past few years 
the company may seek periodically in the future  to the extent available  to enter into financial hedging contracts for the purchase of propylene and benzene in an effort to manage its raw material purchase costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that the company will utilize such financial hedging contracts or that the use of such instruments by the company will be successful 
the company can be exposed to losses in connection with such contracts equal to the amount by which the fixed hedge price on the contract is above the market price for such chemicals at the time of purchase 
the company did not enter into any material financial hedging contracts in and since its acquisition in  the blue island plant has operated at or near full capacity and  in order to economically expand its production capacity  the company would be required to incur significant costs  as a result  the company has no plans to expand the capacity of the blue island plant 
since  the company has sourced on average approximately million pounds of acetone annually from the mt 
vernon plant 
in  the amount of acetone available to jlm from the mt 
vernon plant was reduced by approximately million pounds 
over the next four years  the amount of acetone available to jlm was further reduced by approximately to million pounds as a result of increased consumption by ge plastics 
through improvement in operating efficiency the mt 
vernon plant has increased their acetone output  thereby offsetting increased internal consumption 
as a result  jlm does not anticipate any further material reduction in volume 
tax matters jlm accounts for us income taxes and accrues for us income tax liabilities based on its consolidated us earnings 
the company s foreign subsidiaries file tax returns in the countries where incorporated 
to the extent these subsidiaries are profitable  taxes are paid based on each country s prevailing tax rate 
upon repatriation of non us earnings  the non us allows a foreign tax credit  subject to certain limitations  to be applied against the company s us consolidated return for the foreign taxes paid by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
if losses are incurred  countries in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are incorporated generally allow the losses to be carried forward and applied against income earned in subsequent years 
the company s former venezuelan operation incurred losses which generated net operating loss carryforwards nols and  based on venezuelan tax regulations  these nols may be carried forward for three years 
the company purchased approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in holland  through the acquisition of tolson  that can be carried forward indefinitely 
during   and respectively  the holland operation generated approximately   and  respectively  of income on which there will be no income taxes payable either currently or in the future due to the purchased nol carryforwards 
however  the utilization of the acquired tax credits results in deferred tax expense being recognized of approximately  in   in and  in in general  foreign losses are not deductible for us federal income tax purposes and as a result cannot be offset against us pre tax profits
