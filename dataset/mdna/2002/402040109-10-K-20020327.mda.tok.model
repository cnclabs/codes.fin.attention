item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we operated guitar center retail locations in major markets and eight stores in secondary markets as of december  we also operate the largest direct response channel musician s friend catalog and internet in the musical instruments industry in the united states 
in addition  we acquired the assets of american music group and related companies in the second quarter of american music group  through its band instrument retail stores  is a leading provider of band instruments and accessories  and primarily focuses on school band and orchestral instrument sales and rentals 
we are operating the american music business as a division of our guitar center retail business 
from to  our net sales grew at an annual compound growth rate of  principally due to the comparable store sales growth of our guitar center stores averaging per year  the opening of new stores  and a per year increase in the direct response channel 
we believe such volume increases are the result of the continued success of the implementation of our business strategy  continued growth in the music products industry and increasing consumer awareness of the guitar center  musician s friend and american music brand names 
we achieved comparable store sales growth of  and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we do not expect comparable store sales to continue to increase at historical rates 
we opened a total of guitar center stores in and currently anticipate opening approximately to guitar center stores in and approximately to stores in some of these guitar center stores will be smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
in addition  we plan to open six to eight american music stores during and to in for the immediate future  our objective is that about half of these new american music units will be new stores and about half will be acquisitions of existing businesses 
we will continue to pursue our strategy of clustering stores in major markets to take advantage of operating and advertising efficiencies and to build awareness of the guitar center and american music group brand names in new markets 
in some markets this clustering strategy results in some transfer of sales from existing stores to new locations 
as we enter new markets  we expect that we will initially incur higher administrative and promotional costs per store than is currently experienced in established markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase as other music product retailers attempt to execute national growth strategies 
our business strategy will also emphasize opportunities to continue to grow each of our businesses  including through further acquisitions if attractive candidates can be located for reasonable prices 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of inventory we value our guitar center inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering planned sales volume and other factors and  based on this evaluation  has recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  consumer demand or competition differ from our expectations 
rental inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the specific identification method and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the rental agreement for rent to own sales  or over the estimated useful life of the rented instrument for rental only items 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles historically have been reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by said assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with our ongoing review of our long lived assets  we determined that there were uncertainties regarding the ongoing business of a non consolidated entity in which we hold an investment 
accordingly  we recorded a million charge representing the write off of this investment 
at december   this was our only investment of this kind 
there are no other events or changes in circumstances of which we are aware indicating that the carrying value of our long lived assets may trigger an impairment consideration  however  we will periodically recognize impairments  if any 
as described below under new accounting pronouncements  the accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets will change significantly effective january  sales returns we allow customers to return product when they meet certain established criteria 
we regularly review and revise  when deemed necessary  our estimates of sales returns based primarily upon actual returns and historical trends 
actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions or the competitive environment differ from our expectations

the foregoing statement is a forward looking statement and is subject to the qualifications set forth below under forward looking statements  business risks 
net sales from the direct response channel totaled million in  a million increase from the growth in direct response sales has been driven by continued increases in internet sales offset in part by declining catalog sales 
catalog sales decreased to million in from million in internet sales for the year increased to million from million last year 
the trend in favor of internet sales over catalog sales is expected to continue 
we believe that revenues in the direct response division were adversely affected by weak economic conditions that are affecting the hobbyist customer base of this unit 
total sales have been adversely affected by the recent slow down in the overall us economy

selling  general and administrative expenses for the direct response division were of sales compared to last year

operating income  for the reasons stated above  decreased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating income was and in the years ended december  and  respectively

included in interest expense  net is a  charge in connection with the extension of our line of credit and the replacement of one of the former lenders in the syndicate 
the overall increase in interest expense  net reflects increased borrowings under our credit facility  offset by a reduction in interest rates applicable to those borrowings 
income tax expense for the year ended was million compared to million for the same period last year 
we did not recognize a tax benefit on the million write off of the minority investment in a non consolidated entity because of the capital nature of the write down and the uncertainty that we will have future capital gains to utilize the capital loss 
net income for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal as a result of the combinations of factors described above

gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  compared to decreased to from 
gross profit margin percentage for the retail stores in after buying and occupancy costs was compared to in the reduction in gross profit margin relates to increased occupancy costs caused by the number of immature stores in the total store base  increased freight expense as a result of opening new stores farther from some of our key vendors and higher shrink losses

selling  general and administrative expenses for the direct response division were of sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal the improvement largely reflects the leveraging of corporate overhead and marketing expenses as a result of the increase in sales compared to transaction and store conversion costs totaled million  or of sales  during the year ended december  no similar costs were incurred in operating income for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase is principally due to the increase in operating income from the direct response unit and the absence of transaction expenses compared to as a percentage of sales  operating income was and in the years ended december  and  respectively

we anticipate that in the future the income tax rate will be approximately 
in the first quarter of  a charge to operations of million  net of tax of million  was incurred for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to expense pre opening costs 
no similar charge was incurred in net income for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase in operating income from the direct response unit  the absence of transaction expenses compared to prior year  and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our need for liquidity will arise primarily from interest payable on indebtedness and the funding of capital expenditures and working capital requirements  as well as possible acquisitions 
we have historically financed our operations through internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
please see item business risks related to the business herein for a discussion of factors which could reasonably likely result in a decrease in the amount of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
we have no mandatory payments of principal on the million of senior notes outstanding prior to their final maturity in as of december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility  excluding million outstanding on letters of credit  and had available borrowings of million 
the credit facility permits borrowings up to million  subject to borrowing base limitations million at december  
certain assets secure the credit facility and the actual amount available is tied to our inventory and receivable base 
a fee of is assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility 
borrowings bear interest at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin rate at december   or at libor plus an applicable margin rate at december   at our option  with interest due monthly 
the applicable margin rate is based upon a quarterly calculation of average daily availability at the end of each fiscal quarter 
borrowings are subject to minimum annual interest rate of 
the applicable interest rate at december  was libor plus 
the agreement underlying the credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants 
we were in compliance with such requirements as of december  for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  most of which represented cash income from operations  net of additions to inventory 
cash used in investing activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures for retail store expansions and computer equipment purchases million  and the acquisition of american music group million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million  which consisted principally of borrowings under our credit facilities 
inventory increased from million to million  or 
the increase in inventory was required principally to support existing sales growth and the opening of new retail locations 
the increase also reflects the acquired balance of american music s inventory of million 
inventory per square foot at guitar center retail stores was at december  compared to in inventory increased from million to million  or  for the direct response division 
the increase in inventory was required principally to support sales growth 
our ongoing objective is to improve inventory performance by refining our replenishment processes and systems  utilizing a distribution center for our guitar center stores  and through improved planning  presentation  and display of inventories in our retail stores 
we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by opening additional stores in new and existing markets 
during  we opened new guitar center stores 
each new large format guitar center store typically has required approximately to million for gross inventory 
historically  our cost of capital improvements for a large format guitar center store has been approximately  consisting of leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment 
we incur higher costs in some geographic areas  particularly the northeast 
we have developed smaller guitar center stores to build in secondary markets or sites that we do not believe will support our large format units 
the first of these units was opened in late and six more had been opened as of december  our small format stores will incur approximately  to  in capital expenditures and require approximately  to  in inventory 
we are also anticipating additional capital and strategic requirements related to improving our fulfillment facilities  upgrading our technology and systems  and pursuing new opportunities in the e commerce activities of guitar center and musician s friend  and related businesses 
in july  we leased a new distribution facility for musician s friend in kansas city  and in july we closed our existing distribution facilities in medford  oregon and knoxville  tennessee and consolidated all direct response fulfillment in kansas city 
during  we began construction of a central distribution center in the indianapolis  indiana area for our guitar center retail store operations with a view towards the facility commencing operation in the second half of we have entered into a year agreement to lease the facility and we also plan to enter into numerous additional commitments necessary to support the operations of the facility 
migration from our present drop ship model to a centralized distribution model is an important development in our operating strategy and will require significant financial and managerial resources for the next several quarters 
we also continue to make significant investments in information technology across our businesses and to incur costs and make investments designed to expand the reach of guitar center and musician s friend on the internet 
the costs of these initiatives and other investments related to our businesses will continue to be significant 
during  we expect to incur approximately million to million in capital expenditures 
our expansion strategy is to continue to increase our market share in existing markets and to penetrate strategically selected new markets 
we opened a total of guitar center stores in and stores in  and currently anticipate opening approximately to guitar center stores in some of these stores will be smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
during  we plan to open six to eight american music stores 
in  our present plan is to open approximately to additional american music stores 
for the immediate future  our objective is that about half of these new american music units will be new stores and about half will be acquisitions of existing businesses 
we believe there exists a number of acquisition opportunities in the relatively fragmented band instruments market that could be a good fit into our american music platform 
we also believe there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music products retailers or other complimentary businesses  if attractive opportunities can be identified 
while we cannot provide assurance that we will complete any further acquisition transactions  in the ordinary course of our business we investigate and engage in negotiations regarding such opportunities 
acquisitions will be financed with drawings under our existing credit facilities  expansion of our credit facilities  issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination  depending upon transaction size and market conditions  among other things 
our capital resources and liquidity for are presently expected to be provided by net cash flow from operations and additional borrowings under our credit facility and advances under operating leases 
depending upon market conditions  we may also elect or be required to raise additional capital in the form of common or preferred equity  debt or convertible securities for the purpose of providing additional capital to fund working capital needs or continued growth of our existing business  or to refinance existing obligations 
any such financing activity will be dependent upon many factors  including our liquidity needs  market conditions and prevailing market terms  and we can not assure you that future external financing for guitar center will be available on attractive terms or at all

these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
we also have acquired personal property through operating leases and based on current favorable market terms we plan to expand the use of this source of financing in payments for these lease commitments are provided for by cash flows generated from operations 
the revolving line of credit provides for a maximum facility of  subject to certain borrowing base limitations and expires december  we plan to make additional borrowings or pay down the line of credit based on our cash flow requirements

new accounting pronouncements on july   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

these new pronouncements significantly change the permissible accounting methods for business combinations and the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
prior to the adoption of these new standards  goodwill and similar intangible assets were generally amortized into income on a stated periodic basis 
this treatment will be replaced by an alternative method  which will not require goodwill amortization on a stated basis but rather will require periodic testing of the goodwill for impairment  with no charge to income except to the extent of any such impairment 
we adopted the new rules effective january   at which time we ceased to record periodic goodwill charges absent an impairment charge 
as of december   goodwill was million  the majority of which relates to the american music group acquisition 
amortization expense related to goodwill included in the consolidated statement of income was   and  at december   and  respectively 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

this new pronouncement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  and we presently intend to adopt this standard effective january  we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

this pronouncement provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
effective january   and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our operating results are not highly seasonal  except for the effect of the holiday selling season in november and december 
sales in the fourth quarter are typically significantly higher on a per store basis and through the direct response unit than in any other quarter 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
forward looking statements  business risks this annual report contains forward looking statements relating to  among other things  future results of operations  growth and investment plans  sales  trends in gross margin  growth in the internet business and other factors affecting growth in sales and earnings 
specific forward looking statements are provided regarding our management s current views regarding comparable store sales and new store openings 
statements regarding new store openings are based largely on our current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated business risks related to  among other things  the identification of suitable sites or acquisition opportunities  the timely construction  staffing and merchandising of those stores and other matters  some of which are outside of our control 
comparative store sales growth is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our sales and promotion strategies and the effect of competition  including other national operators of music products stores attempting to implement national growth strategies 
the american music business was only recently acquired by us and may be subject to significant fluctuations as we integrate these activities with the other guitar center businesses 
sales and earnings trends are also affected by many other factors including  among others  world and national political events  general economic conditions  which recently have been weak  particularly in terms of consumer demand and general retail sales  the effectiveness of our promotion and merchandising strategies  changes in the music products industry  retail sales trends and the emergence of new or growing specialty retailers of music products 
in light of these risks  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will in fact be realized 
the statements made by us in this report represent our views as of the date of this report  and it should not be assumed that the statements made herein remain accurate as of any future date 
we do not presently intend to update these statements and undertake no duty to any person to affect any such update under any circumstances 
for further discussion of risks associated with our business  please see the discussion under the caption item business risks related to the business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have any assets or liabilities which  in our view  impose upon us significant market risk except for our outstanding indebtedness represented by million principal amount of senior notes due with a fixed interest rate of and our credit facility which has a variable rate of interest generally consisting of stated premiums above the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
to the extent prevailing short term interest rates fluctuate the interest expense we incur on our credit facility will change with a resulting effect positive or negative on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  based on the balances outstanding under our credit facility at year end  such a fluctuation would have to be relatively significant to have a material financial impact on us 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
presently  we do not carry significant cash balances as any cash in excess of our daily operating needs is used to reduce our borrowings
