these policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements on pages of this form k  which note is part of the financial statements contained in item of this form k 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements 
the most significant of which are related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  expected useful lives assigned to properties  plants and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring reserves  postretirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies 
other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in the forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results below 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
recent accounting standards the recent accounting standards that could potentially affect the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements on pages of this form k  which note is part of the financial statements contained in item of this form k 
forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by the company or made by management of the company may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s operating results to differ materially from those projected 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
changes in general economic conditions 
the company s customers generally consist of other manufacturers and suppliers who purchase the company s industrial shipping containers and containerboard for their own containment and shipping purposes 
because the company supplies a cross section of industries  such as chemicals  food products  petroleum products  pharmaceuticals and metal products  demand for the company s industrial shipping containers and containerboard and related corrugated products has historically corresponded to changes in general economic conditions of the countries in which it operates 
accordingly  the company s financial performance is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions existing in these countries 
the relative strength of the us dollar 
the company operates in over countries throughout the world 
as such  it is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  given the geographic presence of the company s operations  this exposure is mitigated to some degree 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded competition 
the company s business of manufacturing and selling industrial shipping containers and containerboard is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are price  quality and service 
many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources 
demand in containerboard market 
industry demand for containerboard has declined in recent years causing competitive pricing pressures in the containerboard market which has negatively impacted the company s financial performance in recent years 
raw material shortages 
the company s raw materials are principally pulpwood  waste paper for recycling  paper  steel and resins 
some of these materials have been  and in the future may be  in short supply 
shortages in raw materials could adversely affect the company s operations 
environmental and health and safety matters  product liability claims 
the company must comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding federal  state  local and foreign environmental matters  such as air and water quality and waste disposal 
the company must also comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding safety and health matters 
the failure to materially comply with such rules and regulations could adversely affect the company s operations 
furthermore  litigation or claims against the company with respect to such matters could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
the company may also become subject to product liability claims which could adversely affect the company 
risks associated with acquisitions 
during the past several years the company has invested  and for the foreseeable future the company anticipates investing  a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the failure to retain key employees and contracts and the inability to integrate businesses without material disruption 
in addition  other companies in the company s industries have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the company s operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that the company will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect the company s financial performance 
timber and timberland sales 
the company has a significant inventory of standing timber and timberlands 
the frequency and volume of sales of timber and timberlands will have an effect on the company s financial performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk related to its financial instruments that include borrowings under its million senior secured credit agreement and interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and eur million 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements have been entered into to manage the company s exposure to its variable rate borrowings 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the senior secured credit agreement  the table presents scheduled amortizations of principal and the current weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents annual amortizations of notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
under the swap agreements  the company receives interest quarterly from the counterparties and pays interest quarterly to the counterparties 
the fair value of the senior secured credit agreement is based on current rates available to the company for debt of the same remaining maturity 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements have been determined based upon the current market settlement prices of comparable contracts 
financial instruments us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value senior secured credit agreement scheduled amortizations average interest rate a interest rate swaps scheduled amortizations average fixed pay rate average receive rate b a variable rate specified is based on the libor rate or an alternative base rate plus a calculated margin at october  b the average receive rate is based upon the libor rates the company was scheduled to receive at october  the rates presented are not intended to project the company s expectations for the future 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed by the counterparties at october   a basis point increase in interest rates would improve the fair value of the swap agreements to a liability of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a fair value liability of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concluded foreign currency risk on march   the company acquired van leer industrial packaging  an industrial shipping containers manufacturer with operations in over countries 
consequently  the company s operating income is potentially affected to a significant degree by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  given the geographic presence of the company s operations  the company mitigates this exposure to some degree 
additionally  the company s transaction exposure is somewhat limited due to the company both producing and selling a majority of its products within each respective country 
the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain short term intercompany loan balances amongst the company s foreign businesses 
such contracts limit the company s exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
at october   the company had contracts outstanding of million 
the fair value of these contracts at october  was million 
each of these contracts is hedging the exposure of the euro against the fluctuation of various other currencies 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the euro against these other currencies indicates that if the euro uniformly weakened by against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million 
conversely  if the euro uniformly strengthened by against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would increase by million 
any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
commodity price risk the company s operating income is potentially affected to a significant degree by fluctuations in the cost of its raw materials 
currently  the company has no derivative instruments used to hedge against such fluctuations in commodity prices
