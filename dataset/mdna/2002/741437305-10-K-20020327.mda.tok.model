overview the company is engaged in the construction  development  management and operation of cellular telephone systems in the southeastern united states 
as of december   the company provided cellular telephone service to  subscribers in georgia  alabama  south carolina and florida in a total of licensed service areas  composed of eight msa s and eight rsa s  with an aggregate estimated population of million 
the company sells its cellular telephone service as well as a full line of cellular products and accessories principally through its network of retail stores 
the company markets all of its products and services under the nationally recognized service mark cellularone 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentage which certain amounts bear to total revenue 
for the year ended december  revenue service equipment sales and installation total revenue operating expenses engineering  technical and other direct engineering and technical other direct costs of services cost of equipment selling  general and administrative selling and marketing customer service general and administrative non cash compensation 
depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation consists of costs of cellular telephone network  including inter trunk costs  span line costs  cell site repairs and maintenance  cell site utilities  cell site rent  engineers salaries and benefits and other operational costs 
consists of net costs of roaming  costs of prepaid service  costs of long distance  costs of interconnection with wireline telephone companies and other costs of services 
consists primarily of the costs of the cellular telephones and accessories sold  sales and marketing personnel  employee and agent commissions 
consists primarily of salaries and benefits  sales commissions and advertising and promotional expenses 
consists primarily of salaries and benefits of customer service personnel and costs of printing and mailing subscriber s bills 
includes salaries and benefits of general and administrative personnel and other overhead expenses 
operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes that operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation is viewed as a relevant supplemental measure of performance in the cellular telephone industry 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  although the company experienced subscriber growth during the year ended december   increasing their total subscribers by to  and the related increase in penetration from to  the decrease in outcollect roaming revenue and its related toll  more than offset the increase in local revenue resulting in decreased operating income 
excluding outcollect air and toll revenue  the average revenue per post paid subscriber increased from for the year ended december  to for the current year 
the company was also negatively affected by an increase in the provision for bad debts million  which combined with decreased outcollect revenue accounts primarily for the company s decreased operating income 
revenue 
service revenues totaled approximately million for the current year compared to approximately million for or a decrease of 
the million decrease is principally a result of the reduction in outcollect air and toll revenue million 
partially offsetting this decrease  is an increase in access revenue million principally due to an increase in the average revenue per rate plan combined with added post paid subscribers for the current twelve month period 
although the company was able to realize an increase in its average access revenue per plan  there was a corresponding increase in the number of free minutes included with these plans which resulted in a decrease of million in post paid airtime revenue 
as the company moved toward the increased usage of multi state and national plans  there was a decrease in the amount of long distance revenue billed to its subscribers 
the number of prepaid subscribers increased during the current year  which increased prepaid revenue by million 
other local revenue items resulted in an increase of  for the current twelve month period 
the reduction in outcollect air and toll revenue is a combination of reduced average reimbursement rates 
for the year ended december  compared to 
for the current year and minutes of use million minutes for the current year compared with million minutes for last year 
the decreasing reimbursement rates are a result of increased competition for roaming traffic which led to reduced negotiated contractual rates with other cellular carriers 
this trend may continue as a result of new roaming rates negotiated with some of the company s roaming partners as well as the increased number of wireless carriers in each market which can be utilized by other carriers subscribers 
equipment and installation revenue was million for the current year compared to million in an increase in the number of handsets sold or upgraded  additional units for the current year resulted in an increase of  for phone revenue 
for the current year  excluding upgrades  the company sold  handsets of which  were digital and  were analog 
for the prior year   handsets were sold of which  were digital and  were analog 
a reduction of  of accessory sales and installation revenue more than offset the increase in handset revenue 
historically prepaid customers buy fewer accessories than traditional post paid customers which contributed to the decrease in accessory revenue 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses increased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in after excluding non cash compensation and depreciation and amortization  operating expenses amount to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for total operating costs per subscriber excluding pcc overhead and all non cash charges amounted to in compared with in engineering  technical and other direct expenses increased from million in to million in there are three major components in this category 
the net cost of incollect roaming  which represents the difference between the amount paid to other cellular carriers for the company s subscribers roaming in other carriers markets and the amount charged to these subscribers  variable network costs such as inter trunk  long distance and directory assistance costs  and engineering costs which consist principally of salaries and related fringe benefits  fixed span line costs and tower rentals 
as a result of negotiations with other cellular carriers see comments above concerning outcollect revenue  the company was able to reduce the amount it reimburses those carriers for incollect roaming resulting in net incollect revenue of million for the current year compared to net revenue of million for incollect costs before the revenue offset dropped from million in to million in the current year 
significantly offsetting the reduction in cost was a reduction in revenue billed to the company s subscribers for their roaming activity 
as the company offers more multi state and nationwide programs  the minutes associated with roaming decreases 
these minutes become home minutes for purposes of billing and are then included in the total number of free minutes each subscriber has depending on their particular plan  which in turn may or may not create airtime revenue for the company 
incollect revenue including toll decreased from million in to million in this reduction was augmented by decreased long distance and directory assistance costs resulting from renegotiated rates 
during the third quarter of  the company was forced to switch the vendor that dealt with the prepaid system as the previous vendor went out of business 
as a result of the change  the additional cost to run the prepaid system included in direct expenses amounted to million for the current year 
other direct costs  principally long distance  increased by million for the current year due to an increase in usage 
engineering costs in total increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the current year or an increase of million 
during the current year  the company added additional cell sites 
the additional cell sites cause additions in cell site rent and utilities for the current year million 
the additional sites also result in increases in fixed span line and inter trunk costs 
the total cost of equipment increased from million in to million for the current year 
without the cost of accessories actual handset costs decreased by million despite the additional units sold or upgraded and the increasing demand for digital rather than analog handsets 
the average handset cost decreased from in to for the current year 
as a percentage of recovered cost  the company recovered of the cost of equipment in compared to a recovery of in principally as a result of diminished accessory sales that have a positive margin and a decrease in installation revenue 
selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million for to for the current year 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a increased from of total revenue in to in sales and marketing costs included in sg a are comprised of installation costs  salaries  commissions and advertising 
the sum of these components amounted to million for the year and million for increases in commissions and advertising accounted for the increase 
the cost to add a gross subscriber  which consists of the net loss on equipment sales and sales and marketing expenditures  decreased from in to in customer service costs also included in sg a  primarily billing costs and payroll and related benefits  increased to million in from million in an increase of million for the generation of subscriber s monthly statements  which include printing and mailing costs  are a direct function of the increases in the number of subscribers 
additional subscribers require an increase in the number of cellular bills mailed out  as well as an increase in the number of customer service representatives necessary to handle the subscriber inquiries 
in addition  temporary costs related to the mandated area code changes in the markets contributed to the increase in costs 
offsetting these increases was a million credit issued to the company by its current billing vendor due to the problems encountered during the billing conversion see bad debts included in general and administrative expenses described below 
general and administrative expenses the final component of sg a increased to million in from million in the increase for the current year of million is principally a result of the increase in the current year of the provision for bad debts  which increased from million in to million in during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its billing vendor when it learned that the previous billing vendor would not be a long term participant in the cellular billing business 
the transition encountered problems and as a result  the company s collection efforts were hampered  which led to a longer average aging period of the company s accounts receivable and a necessity to provide a higher provision for bad debts 
in the fourth quarter of the current year  the company has consolidated the collection process in one location in order to perform the collection process more efficiently 
general and administrative expenses  excluding customer service costs  increased from of revenue for the previous year to for the current year 
included in operating expenses for both and is a charge of million representing the non cash compensation charges related to the conversion by an officer of the corporation of the company s preferred stock into common stock see notes to consolidated financial statements 
such charges are being expensed over the vesting period of the common stock 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in the increase is a combination of additional depreciation expense due to the increase in capital equipment additions during and and additional amortization for other intangible assets 
operating income decreased from million in to million in earnings before non cash compensation and depreciation and amortization ebitda amounted to million for or of total revenue compared to million or of total revenue for the decline is primarily a function of the decrease in roaming air and toll revenue and the increase in the provision for bad debts 
interest expense  other income  income taxes  and net income 
net interest expense increased to in from million in principally as a result of an adjustment in for interest earned in a prior period 
other income for includes million resulting from the net gain on the sale of the company s minority equity investment in other cellular properties 
the remaining million is principally attributed to net gains on security transactions of pcc 
other income for resulted largely from gains from security transactions of pcc 
the income tax provision for of million compared to the provision of million in is principally a result of the decrease in financial statement taxable income in at an effective rate of approximately adjusted for certain non taxable security transactions in both years 
the net income of million for compared to net income of million for is a function of the items discussed above 
during the prior year  the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which requires the deferral of certain revenue over the approximate length of a subscribers contract or over the remaining unused minutes for prepaid revenue 
the effect on the prior year s financial statements was not material 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating results for the year ended december  reflect the continued improvement in operating cash flow ebitda  subscriber growth and the related increase in penetration  a slight decrease in the average revenue per subscriber arpu and the continuation of strong cost controls which translate to a low average operating cost per subscriber 
revenue 
service revenues totaled approximately million for the current year compared to approximately million for or an increase of 
the increase is principally a result of the greater amount of access revenue million due to the increase in the average number of post paid subscribers  as well as increases in toll revenue million  feature revenue million and prepaid airtime revenue million 
the increase in toll revenue is primarily due to the increase in the number of minutes used by post paid subscribers an increase of million minutes which per subscriber increased from minutes per post paid subscriber in to minutes in despite the increase in minutes of use  airtime revenue was flat as the company s rate plans provided larger amounts of free minutes than in the past in order to remain competitive in its markets 
as a result of increased competition for additional post paid cellular subscribers  the company s local revenue per cellular subscriber decreased slightly from in to in in addition  the company s outcollect roaming revenue  which is revenue that the company derives from other cellular companies subscribers roaming in our markets  increased by  as a result of an increase in usage from million minutes in to million minutes in  partially offset by reduced reimbursement rates from the other carriers 
the company expects this trend to continue as a result of new roaming rates negotiated with some of the company s roaming partners as well as the increased number of wireless carriers in each market which can be utilized by other carriers 
equipment and installation revenue amounted to million for the current year compared to million in the increase in equipment revenue of is primarily a combination of a greater number of gross pre and post paid subscriber additions  increase over as well as a greater emphasis on accessory sales to new subscribers 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in after excluding non cash compensation and depreciation and amortization  operating expenses amount to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for total operating costs per cellular subscriber excluding pcc overhead and all non cash charges amounted to in and in engineering  technical and other direct expenses decreased from million in to million in there are three major components in this category 
the net cost of incollect roaming  which represents the difference between the amount paid to other cellular carriers for the company s subscribers roaming in other carriers markets and the amount charged to these subscribers  variable network costs such as inter trunk  long distance and directory assistance costs  and engineering costs which consist principally of salaries and related fringe benefits  fixed span line costs and tower rentals 
as a result of negotiations with other cellular carriers see comments above concerning outcollect revenue  the company was able to reduce the amount it reimburses those carriers for incollect roaming resulting in net incollect revenue of million for the current year compared to a net cost of million for this reduction was augmented by decreased long distance and directory assistance costs resulting from renegotiated rates 
partially offsetting these cost savings  were increases in variable telephone costs such as interconnect and reverse toll charges as well as the direct cost of prepaid usage due to the increase in prepaid revenue and the implementation of a new prepaid software system 
decreases in engineering salaries and related expenses were offset by increases in fixed span line costs and additional cell site rental costs as the company continued to build out its system by adding new cell sites and increasing the number of radios in the existing cell sites 
the increase in gross subscriber additions combined with the increase in cellular phone upgrades as well as the higher cost of digital phones  resulted in an increase of the cost of equipment sold from million in to million in in addition  increases in the sale of accessories contributed to the increase 
as a percentage of recovered cost  the company recovered of the cost of equipment in compared to a recovery of in selling  general and administrative sg a decreased slightly from million for to for the current year 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a decreased from of total revenue in to in sales and marketing costs which include installation costs  salaries  commissions and advertising  amounted to million for the year and million for increases in salaries and related benefits  commissions and advertising expenditures increased in total by million as the number of gross activations increased for the current year 
the cost to add a gross subscriber  which consists of the net loss on equipment sales and sales and marketing expenditures  decreased from in to in customer service costs  primarily billing costs and payroll and related benefits  increased to million in from million in increases in personnel and billing costs are a direct function of the increases in the number of subscribers 
additional subscribers require an increase in the number of cellular bills mailed out  as well as an increase in the number of customer service representatives necessary to handle the additional subscriber inquiries 
general and administrative expenses were reduced to million in compared with million in the company s provision for bad debts decreased from million in to million in due to additional customer service staffing  as well as the utilization of outside collection services 
additional savings in pcc overhead million reduction principally from payroll related costs as well as reductions in legal and professional fees  and computer support services million contributed to the million reduction in expenses 
included in operating expenses for and is a charge of million and million representing the non cash compensation charges related to the conversion by an officer of the corporation of the company s preferred stock into common stock see notes to consolidated financial statements 
such charges are being expensed over the vesting period of the common stock 
the conversions occurred during and since the conversions occurred in varying stages prior to december   the year has a full year of amortization whereas has less than twelve months 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily a result of additional depreciation expense due to the significant capital equipment additions during and operating income grew from million to million in earnings before non cash compensation and depreciation and amortization ebitda amounted to million for or of total revenue compared to million or of total revenue for the improvement is a function of management s ability to control costs while still maintaining subscriber growth 
the increase in ebitda from to represents a growth of 
interest expense  other income  income taxes  and net income 
interest expense decreased to in from million in during  long term debt consisted of  million of senior subordinated notes  million of senior secured notes and million of senior exchangeable payable in kind notes 
in june  the company allowed the conversion of the million payable in kind notes and therefore incurred an additional six months of interest expense 
the increase of million in interest income is a result of the increase in the average rate the company earned on its cash during the year 
other income for resulted largely from gains from security transactions of the parent company and in resulted primarily from the liquidation of a long standing investment by the company million combined with net gains realized from security transactions by the parent company 
the income tax provision for of million compared to the provision of million is principally a result of the increase in taxable income in at an effective rate of approximately

during the current year  the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which requires the deferral of certain revenue over the approximate length of a subscribers contract or over the remaining unused minutes for prepaid revenue 
the effect on the current financial statements was not material 
liquidity and capital resources the company s long term capital requirements consist of funds for capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
historically  the company has met its capital requirements primarily through equity contributions  long term debt  and to a lesser extent  operating cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million for the year ended december  working capital at december  approximated million 
the current level of operating cash flow is sufficient to fund the current anticipated level of capital expenditures and cash interest  which interest amounts to approximately million related to the million senior subordinated notes due july  and the million senior secured notes due december  the notes are callable after june   and the notes are callable after july  in addition  the company is obligated for operating leases of real and personal property for the years subsequent to december  in the amount of million 
further details regarding the notes and lease obligations can be found in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s cash flow from operating activities is principally a result of net income adjusted for non cash charges and marketable security transactions 
the change in accounts receivable positively effected the cash from operating activities and negatively effected the cash from operating activities 
the year ended december   saw a large increase in accounts receivable as a result of the change in billing vendors during the latter part of and the resulting problems with the conversion as previously discussed 
the difficulty incurred with the conversion caused customers statements to be mailed later than normal which resulted in a delay in cash payments from the company s subscribers 
during the year ended december   the company reduced their receivable balance to a level comparable to the balance at the end of which resulted in a positive cash flow of million compared to a decrease of million for contributing to the decrease in the level of accounts receivable was the centralization of the collection process  resolution of the conversion issues and an increase of million for accounts receivable reserved 
the company spent a lower amount for capital expenditures for the current year as compared to the previous two years resulting in a decrease of million and million for the current year when compared with and  respectively 
at december   the company had sold most of its marketable securities and had sold its investment in other cellular properties 
the company also repurchased less of its common stock  which was the principal component of cash used in financing activities 
assuming the verizon transaction takes place during the second quarter of  cash flows from the partnership will not be available to the company until the third quarter of whereupon of the interest earned on its capital account in the limited partnership will be distributed if available 
any other cash income will be generated from interest or other investments the company acquires after the verizon transaction is completed 
accounting policies for financial reporting purposes  the company reports of revenues and expenses for the markets for which it provides cellular telephone service 
however  in several of its markets  the company held less than of the equity ownership prior to december  the minority stockholders and partners share of income or losses in those markets is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as minority interest except for losses in excess of their capital accounts and cash call provisions which are not eliminated in consolidation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company generally utilizes fixed debt to fund its acquisitions 
management believes that the use of fixed rate debt minimizes the company s exposure to market conditions and the ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable rate financing
