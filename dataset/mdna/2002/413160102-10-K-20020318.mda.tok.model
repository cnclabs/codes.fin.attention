item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and sells a variety of broadband solutions that allow communications service providers around the world to deliver video  voice and data to their subscribers 
harmonic s technically advanced fiber optic  digital video and data delivery systems enable network operators to provide a range of interactive and advanced digital services that include digital video  high speed internet access  telephony  hdtv  video and audio streaming  and video on demand 
historically  almost all of our sales were derived directly or indirectly from sales of fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators 
with the introduction of digital headend products beginning in  we have broadened our product offering to enable delivery of digital video  voice and data over satellite and wireless networks and cable systems 
in order to further expand our digital systems capability  harmonic completed its merger with c cube microsystems inc in may  pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement dated october  under the terms of the merger agreement  c cube spun off its semiconductor business as a separate publicly traded company 
c cube then merged into harmonic and harmonic therefore acquired c cube s divicom business  which provides mpeg encoding products and systems for digital television 
the merger was structured as a tax free exchange of stock and has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in the merger  each share of common stock of c cube was converted into shares of harmonic common stock 
the purchase price  including merger related costs  was approximately billion 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  resulting in allocation of approximately billion to identified intangibles and goodwill 
as of december   the company determined that there was an impairment and recorded an impairment charge of billion  eliminating goodwill and reducing identified intangibles acquired to million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the merger closed on may   and harmonic has consolidated the results of the divicom business in its financial statements from that date forward 
the merged company has been organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
while the two divisions have been organized generally around the pre merger harmonic fiber optics systems and the divicom digital headend systems  respectively  these divisions do not correspond to the pre merger companies in significant ways 
for example  some of harmonic s product lines are now part of the cs division 
harmonic s net sales decreased in due to significantly lower sales within the ban division  partially offset by increased sales within the cs division 
ban division sales decreased by in  principally due to weak cable industry capital spending on transmission upgrades  particularly by at t broadband and rcn 
these two customers accounted for a total of of sales in compared to a combined total of less than of sales in cs division sales increased during reflecting the shipment of new next generation digital products and inclusion of only eight months of sales for the divicom business during net sales were below expectations during each quarter from the second quarter of through the first quarter of as certain customers canceled or delayed orders with harmonic and other vendors  reducing capital spending 
the factors contributing to this slow down in capital spending included uncertain worldwide economic conditions  reduced access to capital markets for certain new and existing customers and inventory levels held by some operators in excess of deployment requirements 
net sales increased sequentially in the second and third quarters of  due primarily to the introduction of the new digital products  and were up during the second half of however  sales decreased modestly during the fourth quarter and are expected to decline slightly on a sequential basis during the seasonally slow first quarter of as capital spending generally remains weak  particularly for ban products 

table of contents in order to reduce operating losses  harmonic implemented a series of measures to control costs and improve operating efficiencies during these measures included a reduction in our work force of approximately since the beginning of the operating results in include charges of million  consisting of million for excess and obsolete inventories  million for excess facility costs  million for fixed asset impairment  and million for severance and other costs 
harmonic expects to report a loss through the first half of  and cannot predict when it will return to profitability 
the provisions for excess and obsolete inventories resulted from significant reductions in the demand for our products  principally ban division products  in accordance with our policy we established provisions for inventory levels in excess of our demand forecasts 
we recorded excess facility charges for facilities that we no longer occupy  do not intend to occupy  or will vacate during we plan to sublease these facilities and have estimated the associated loss based on the expected timing and amount of sublease income 
historically  a majority of harmonic s net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  sales to directv and charter communications accounted for and of net sales  respectively  compared to less than for each of these customers in and in  sales to at t broadband accounted for of net sales compared to in in addition  in sales to rcn represented of net sales 
in  and  sales of ban products accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively  while cs products accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
cs sales prior to the merger in may consisted of sales of harmonic s transend and cyberstream product lines 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
harmonic often recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by harmonic s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of these and other factors  harmonic s operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
due to lower than expected sales during each quarter from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  harmonic failed to meet the expectations of securities analysts  and the price of our common stock declined significantly 
see factors that may affect our future operations our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires harmonic to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported 
table of contents amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were utilized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets  restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities  assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment  and allowances are provided for estimated returns  discounts and warranties 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
revenue on solution sales  which typically includes harmonic and third party product  and services such as design  integration and installation  is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
revenue from services is generally recognized as services are performed 
maintenance services are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically one year 
revenue recognition in each period is dependent on our application of these accounting policies 
if all conditions to recognize revenue are not met  we are required to defer revenue recognition 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor costs to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts for specifically identified doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts was million 
during million was charged to revenue and million was charged to operating expenses for returns  discounts and bad debts 
in the event that actual returns  discounts and bad debts differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  product 
table of contents lifecycles and current inventory levels 
during  million was charged to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventories 
in the event that we adjust our estimates  such as forecasted sales and expected product lifecycles  our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method to determine fair value with a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
as of december   harmonic recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion to writedown the goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of c cube s divicom business completed in may restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for restructuring charges  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  we record restructuring costs when the company commits to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan are not likely 
as a result of the restructuring plans implemented in  harmonic recorded million related to severance and other costs and million for excess facilities 
the estimated loss on facilities which we intend to sublease is based on estimates of the timing and amount of sublease income 
we reassess this liability quarterly based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income do not materialize or change 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on harmonic s review of the complaints filed in the securities class action and other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it has meritorious defenses and accordingly no loss contingencies have been accrued 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is not assured  we established a valuation allowance of million in which fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 

table of contents results of operations harmonic s historical consolidated statements of operations data for each of the three years ended december    and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in process technology total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss net sales harmonic s net sales decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in net sales was due to significantly lower sales within the ban division  partially offset by increased sales within the cs division 
ban division sales decreased by in  principally due to weak capital spending on transmission upgrades  particularly reduced capital spending by at t broadband and rcn 
these two customers accounted for a total of of sales in compared to a combined total of less than of sales in cs sales increased during  principally due to sales of new next generation digital products including the mv encoder and narrowcast services gateway  or nsg  which commenced volume shipment in the second quarter of this increase was also attributable to the fact that net sales for included only eight months of sales for the divicom business as the c cube merger was accounted for as a purchase transaction and closed on may  international sales represented of net sales in  compared to in due principally to the higher international sales mix of the divicom business 
net sales increased to million in  from million in the increase in net sales was due to higher cs division sales primarily attributable to inclusion of sales from the divicom business  as well as higher unit sales of transend and cyberstream 
ban division sales were essentially unchanged in compared to  as higher unit sales of pwrblazer scalable nodes were offset by lower unit sales of metrolink dwdm systems and lower selling prices 
international sales represented of net sales in compared to in due to unusually high domestic sales in and the higher international sales mix of the divicom business 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreased sales and associated lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower production levels and purchasing volumes 
in addition  approximately million of the reduction in gross profit was attributable to the recording of provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  the impairment of certain fixed assets and severance and other costs resulting from 
table of contents streamlining our product lines in both divisions 
the provisions for excess and obsolete inventories resulted from significant reductions in demand for our products  principally ban division products  in accordance with our policy we established provisions for inventory levels in excess of our demand forecasts 
the decreases in gross profit and gross margins were partially offset by the inclusion of divicom for the entire year in gross margins  excluding provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and charges for fixed asset impairment  severance and other costs  and amortization of intangibles  decreased from in  to in  due principally to lower sales  lower pricing and changes in product mix 
however  gross margins excluding special charges improved sequentially during each quarter in due to the launch of new products and cost reduction efforts  and were in the fourth quarter 
gross profit decreased to million of net sales in  from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profit in the ban division which was partially offset by the inclusion of the divicom business 
the significant decrease in gross margins was due to lower margins within each business segment 
ban division margins decreased primarily due to a less favorable product mix which included a higher percentage of node products  lower fixed cost absorption due to lower than expected production volumes and a significant increase in provisions for excess and obsolete inventories 
cs division margins decreased principally due to high fixed costs of the professional services and integration operations  and lower pricing 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to inclusion of divicom for the entire year in  which historically has spent a higher percentage of net sales on research and development than has harmonic  partially offset by lower headcount and associated expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to decreased net sales  but also attributable to the inclusion of divicom for the entire year in research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increases in were due principally to the inclusion of divicom and higher payroll and prototype expenses 
harmonic anticipates that research and development expenses will be lower in absolute dollars in  although they may vary as a percentage of net sales 
sales  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute dollars was due principally to million of excess facility  severance and other costs  and the inclusion of divicom for the entire year in  partially offset by lower headcount and associated expenses 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to the decrease in net sales 
excluding the excess facility charges and severance and other costs  selling  general and administrative expenses were million of net sales in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increases in were primarily due to inclusion of divicom  as well as higher payroll  consulting and recruiting expenses associated with expansion of the sales  marketing and administrative organizations to provide greater customer focus and new product support  and to support harmonic s overall growth in headcount and operations 
harmonic expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will be lower in absolute dollars in  although they may vary as a percentage of net sales 
goodwill  other intangibles and impairment goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately billion were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of the divicom business of c cube  cogent and new media communications 
as of december   an impairment charge of approximately billion was recorded to write down long lived assets associated with the divicom business to fair value based on management s estimate of 
table of contents discounted future cash flows 
as a result of this impairment charge  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles decreased to million in from million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in from million in due to the acquisitions of the divicom business of c cube and cogent 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
see new accounting pronouncements on pages and harmonic plans to adopt sfas no 
effective january  and will cease amortization of goodwill 
harmonic expects to record approximately million in amortization of intangibles in acquired in process technology harmonic recorded charges to operations of million in for acquired in process technology in connection with the c cube merger and cogent acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
stock based compensation harmonic recorded no charges for stock based compensation in  and  respectively 
as of december   however  based on employee participation rates and its stock price  harmonic believes that it has insufficient shares reserved for issuance under its employee stock purchase plan  or espp  to cover all expected purchases under offering periods that have commenced and which run through june although harmonic has sufficient authorized shares to satisfy purchases during the six month purchase period ending june  harmonic believes that approximately  additional shares will be required to meet expected purchases for future six month purchase periods ending december  and june  the issuance of these additional shares requires board and stockholder approval 
harmonic expects to request stockholder approval in may to the extent that the board of directors and stockholders authorize the reservation of additional shares for issuance for these purchase periods  stock based compensation may result 
the projected compensation charges are subject to a number of assumptions and limitations  including the authorization by our board of directors and stockholders of additional shares for issuance under the espp  the timing and amount of employee contributions under the espp  the possible amendment and termination of the espp and fluctuations in the fair market value of our common stock 
if additional shares are authorized  final measurement of stock based compensation expense will be determined quarterly  will be recognized as earned  will fluctuate as the price per share of harmonic common stock fluctuates and could be significant 
for example  based on the market value of our common stock of on december   and the average stock purchase price of per share under open purchase periods of the espp  if the fair market value of our common stock was unchanged on the purchase dates  we could incur a non cash stock based compensation charge totaling approximately million in relation to the approximately  shares that may be purchased 
for each increase or decrease in the price of our common above or below the december  closing price  we would expect an increase or decrease in the non cash stock based compensation charge of approximately  final measurement of any stock based compensation expense which may be incurred will occur on the stock purchase date at the end of each six month purchase period 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in was principally due to lower average cash and short term investments 
lower interest rates also contributed to the decrease 
the increase in was due primarily to interest earned on cash received in the merger  and to a lesser extent  interest earned on cash proceeds resulting from 
table of contents harmonic s public offering of common stock in april the majority of the cash received in the merger was used in to pay taxes incurred on the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business 
income taxes harmonic recorded a benefit from income taxes of only million despite a loss before income taxes of million in this was principally due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for the full amount of harmonic s net deferred tax assets of million  as realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured 
for  harmonic recorded a benefit from income taxes of only million  principally due to non deductible goodwill impairment and amortization  and acquired in process technology related to the acquisition of divicom 
the provision for income taxes for was based on an estimated annual tax rate of 
in  harmonic expects to record a provision for income taxes due principally to foreign income taxes 
this estimate is based on current tax laws  current estimates of operating results and the expected distribution of income among various tax jurisdictions  all of which is subject to change 
in addition  harmonic is liable for c cube s taxes for periods prior to the merger 
see factors that may affect future results of operations we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million as of december  cash used in operations was million in compared to cash used in operations of million in the decrease in cash used in operations was due primarily to payments of approximately million in for estimated tax liabilities related to the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business and for other tax liabilities that harmonic assumed 
cash used in operations during was significantly less than the net loss of million due principally to provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and charges for depreciation and amortization  amortization of goodwill and intangibles  excess facility costs  and fixed asset impairment  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
during  harmonic received income tax refunds of million 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remain outstanding and harmonic expects final settlement  and payment  of these obligations to a variety of taxing authorities and lsi logic during these amounts are included in accrued liabilities 
additions to property  plant and equipment were million during compared to million in capital expenditures in each year consisted of manufacturing  test and computer equipment 
in addition  approximately million of the capital expenditures in each year represented leasehold improvements and related furniture  fixtures and equipment in connection with relocation of former divicom employees to new facilities in sunnyvale  and the implementation of harmonic s new enterprise resource planning software system 
these major capital programs commenced during the second half of and were substantially completed during the first half of as a result of these major programs  capital expenditures were significantly higher during and than historic levels for the combined company and expected future levels 
harmonic expects capital expenditures to be approximately million during harmonic has a bank line of credit facility  which provides for borrowings up to million with a million secured equipment term loan sub limit 
the facility was amended in december and extended until april the facility contains certain financial and other covenants  with which harmonic is in compliance at december  future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate prime rate plus under the equipment term loan and are payable monthly  and are secured by harmonic s assets 
during  harmonic borrowed million under its secured equipment 
table of contents term loan  of which million was outstanding as of december  the term loan  bears interest at to annually on outstanding borrowings which mature at various dates through june there were no other outstanding borrowings under the line as of december  harmonic also has a facility which provides for the sale of trade receivables on a non recourse basis up to million and expires in april trade receivables sold under the facility are discounted based on the bank s prime rate plus for north american customers and for all other customers 
harmonic utilized million of the facility to sell qualifying trade receivables as of december  future payments on borrowings pursuant to the equipment term loan and minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases  including million of minimum lease payments provided for as accrued excess facility costs  as of december   were as follows in thousands non cancelable equipment operating term loan leases and thereafter while harmonic expects to report a loss through the first half of  we believe that our existing liquidity sources  including our bank line of credit and trade receivable sale facilities  will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of september  and the ongoing us war on terrorism 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see factors that may affect future results of operations  risk factors we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us

the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be adopted during harmonic s fiscal year beginning january  harmonic is currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact of sfas no 
and does not expect a material impact upon adoption on its operating results and financial position 
factors that may affect future results of operations we depend on cable and satellite industry capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending in these industries would negatively impact our resources  operating results and financial condition 
prior to the merger with c cube  almost all of harmonic s historic sales had been derived from sales to cable television operators and we expect these sales to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
almost all of the divicom business historic sales had been derived from sales to satellite operators  telephone companies and cable operators 
demand for the combined company s products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators  satellite operators  broadcasters and telephone companies for constructing and upgrading of their systems 
these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  annual budget cycles  the impact of industry consolidation  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for communication services and the acceptance of new video  voice and data services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures  discretionary customer spending patterns  general economic conditions 
in the past  specific factors contributing to reduced capital spending have included uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on generating revenue from existing customers by cable television operators instead of new construction or network upgrades  and general economic conditions in domestic and international markets 

table of contents recent developments in capital markets have reduced access to funding for new and existing customers causing delays in the timing and scale of deployments of our equipment  as well as the postponement of certain projects by our customers 
during the past two years harmonic and other vendors received notification from significant customers  including at t broadband  rcn and bell south  that they were canceling new projects  or delaying new orders to allow them to reduce inventory levels which were in excess of their current deployment requirements 
the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as fiber optic cable  and the need for local zoning and licensing approvals 
we believe that changes in our customers deployment plans have in recent quarters delayed  and may in the future delay  the receipt of new orders or the release of existing backlog 
since the majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  a delay in equipment deployment at any one customer has in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our sales in a particular quarter 
in this regard  the company s sales decreased each quarter from the second quarter of through the first quarter of and were below our expectations in the ban and cs divisions as well as the expectations of securities analysts  and the price of our common stock declined significantly 
cable television capital spending can be subject to the effects of seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather 
ban division sales have decreased significantly from the third quarter of and were lower in than in this was due to weak cable industry spending on transmission upgrades  particularly reduced spending by at t broadband and rcn 
these two customers accounted for a total of of sales in compared to a combined total of less than of sales in cs division sales from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  consisting principally of divicom products  were below divicom s sales levels in and the first quarter of  and were significantly below our expectations at the time the divicom merger was announced in october the lower cs sales were attributable principally to reduced spending by satellite operators 
for a more detailed discussion regarding risks related to at t broadband  rcn and other major customers  see our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of any key customer would have a negative effect on our business 
cs division sales increased sequentially during the second and third quarters of and increased during the second half of compared to the first half of the year  primarily due to demand for our next generation digital systems such as the narrowcast services gateway  or nsg  and the mv encoder 
cs sales of the mv encoder during benefited in particular from the expansion of local channel offerings and compliance with fcc must carry regulations by domestic direct broadcast satellite  or dbs  operators 
we anticipate that  in light of the announced merger of echostar and directv and expectations that operators will add fewer new markets in  our revenue from domestic dbs operators is likely to decline in due to the uncertainty of the capital spending plans of our customers and seasonal weakness  we expect a slight sequential sales decline during the first quarter of harmonic expects to report a loss at least through the first half of  and cannot predict when it will return to profitability 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of any key customer would have a negative effect on our business 
historically  a majority of our sales and sales of divicom have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
sales to our ten largest customers in   and accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
although we are attempting to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets such as the telco and 
table of contents broadcast markets  we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration due in part to the significant capital costs of constructing broadband networks 
for example  comcast and at t broadband  and echostar and directv have announced plans to merge 
both combinations are subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals  among other conditions 
in  sales to directv and charter communications accounted for and of net sales  respectively  compared to less than for each of these customers in and in  sales to at t broadband accounted for of net sales compared to in in addition  in rcn represented of net sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of our net sales in   or the loss of directv or charter communications  or any other significant customer or any reduction in orders by directv  charter communications or any significant customer  or our failure to qualify our products with a significant customer could adversely affect our business  operating results and liquidity 
we cannot currently predict the impact of the acquisition of directv by echostar  if approved  on our future sales 
in addition  we cannot assure you that sales to other customers will compensate for the reduction in sales to at t broadband and rcn nor can we predict the impact of the at t broadband merger with comcast on our future sales 
our sales are made on a purchase order or system contract basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of customer orders  the timing of revenue from systems contracts which may span several quarters  competitive market conditions  our unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  our development of custom products and software  the level of international sales  and economic conditions specific to the cable and satellite industries  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders 
table of contents can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
in this regard  due to lower than expected sales in each quarter from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  we failed to meet our internal expectations  as well as the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and the price of our common stock declined significantly 
as a result of the september  terrorist attacks in new york city and washington  dc  the united states and global economies have weakened and may continue to deteriorate  which may impair our ability to ship our products within the united states and internationally  and may result in further decreases in our revenues and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  it is anticipated that in the wake of these events  the united states and global capital markets will experience a period of continuing volatility 
these events may have a negative impact on our business as a result of the cautious purchasing behavior of customers 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
while we expect to report a loss at least through the first half of  we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including bank line of credit and factoring facilities will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty following the events of september  and the ongoing us war on terrorism 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  we may review other potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any potential acquisition  any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our operating results 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and  of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 

table of contents while our international sales have typically been denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
following implementation of the final phase of the euro changeover effective january   we expect a higher portion of our european business to be denominated in euros which may subject us to increased foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
in addition  foreign markets may not develop in the future 
we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
if actual orders differ materially from these indications  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  or expend resources to manufacture products and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results for the last five quarters were adversely affected by provisions for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately million 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the markets for cable television fiber optics systems and digital video broadcasting systems are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change and declining average selling prices 
harmonic s competitors in the cable television fiber optics systems business include corporations such as arris a company owned in part by nortel and at t  c cor 
net  motorola  philips and scientific atlanta 
in the digital and video broadcasting systems business  we compete broadly with vertically integrated system suppliers including motorola  scientific atlanta  tandberg  thomson multimedia and philips  and in certain product lines with cisco and terayon and a number of smaller companies 
most of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than harmonic 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 
if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard  our business could be seriously harmed 
for example  us cable operators have to date mostly purchased proprietary digital systems from motorola and scientific atlanta 
while certain operators have made limited purchases of the open systems provided by harmonic  we cannot assure you that our digital products will find broad market acceptance with us cable operators 
in addition  companies that have historically not had a large presence in the broadband communications equipment market have begun recently to expand their market share through mergers and acquisitions 
the continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on us 
further  our competitors  particularly competitors of our digital and 
table of contents video broadcasting systems business  may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices resulting in lower gross margins 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature and characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rates  sizes or technological directions 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products  if our products are not cost effective  are not brought to market in a timely manner  are not in accordance with evolving industry standards and architectures  or fail to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  to successfully develop and market our planned products  we must retain and continue to attract personnel with appropriate experience and expertise 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in retaining and attracting qualified personnel 
also  to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we need to effectively manage our operations and the cyclical nature of our business 
the growth of our operations and cyclical nature of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
this strain has been exacerbated by the acquisition of divicom and the subsequent loss of numerous employees  including senior management 
in addition  we reduced our work force by approximately during due to reduced industry spending and demand for our products 
our ability to manage our business effectively in the future  including any future growth  will require us to train  motivate and manage our employees successfully  to attract and integrate new employees into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
in particular  in april we implemented a new management information system 
we believe this new system significantly affects many aspects of our business  including accounting  manufacturing operations  purchasing  sales and marketing functions 
the successful operation of this system is critical to our business 
while the initial phase of 
table of contents implementation has been successful  there can be no assurance that we will complete the transition to the new system in an efficient  cost effective or timely manner or that the new information system will be adequate to support all of our operations 
if we fail to manage our existing operations or any future growth effectively  our business could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
in spite of the current worldwide economic slowdown  competition for qualified technical and other personnel remains intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area and israel  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or noncompetition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
the spin off of c cube s semiconductor business gave rise to a significant tax liability of approximately million based on a valuation of the semiconductor business of billion 
the estimated liability was paid in under state law  harmonic generally is liable for all of c cube s debts  including c cube s liability for taxes resulting from the spin off and other pre merger tax liabilities 
c cube retained and transferred to harmonic in the merger an amount of cash and other consideration sufficient to pay this liability as well as all other tax liabilities of c cube and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the merger 
the merger agreement stipulates that harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business if the cash reserves are not sufficient to satisfy all of c cube s tax liabilities for periods prior to the merger 
if for any reason  the spun off semiconductor business does not have sufficient cash to pay such taxes  or if there are additional taxes due with respect to the non semiconductor business and harmonic cannot be indemnified by c cube  harmonic generally will remain liable  and such liability could have a material adverse effect on harmonic 
the spun off semiconductor business was recently acquired by lsi logic  which assumed these obligations to harmonic 
due to the structure of the merger transaction  harmonic is liable for c cube s general pre merger liabilities and any liabilities relating to c cube s semiconductor business for which the spun off semiconductor business is unable to indemnify harmonic 
the merger of c cube into harmonic  with harmonic as the surviving entity  resulted in our assuming all of the liabilities of c cube at the time of the merger 
pursuant to the merger agreement  harmonic is indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business for liabilities associated with c cube s historic semiconductor business 
however  if lsi logic is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligations to harmonic or if general liability claims not specifically associated with c cube s historic semiconductor business are asserted  we would have to assume such obligations 
those obligations could adversely effect our financial condition 
we may be subject to risks associated with other acquisitions 
we have made and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make acquisitions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel 
table of contents and operations or integrating the acquired technology or products into ours 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our operating results may suffer because of acquisition related expenses  amortization of intangible assets and impairment of acquired goodwill or intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
difficulties in the development and production of video encoding chips by c cube s spun off semiconductor business may adversely impact us 
the divicom business and c cube semiconductor business collaborated on the production and development of two video encoding microelectronic chips prior to the merger 
in connection with the merger  harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business entered into a contractual relationship under which harmonic will have access to certain of the spun off semiconductor business technologies and products which the divicom business previously depended on for its product and service offerings 
however  under the contractual relationships between harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business  which was recently acquired by lsi logic  the semiconductor business does not have a firm commitment to continue the development of video encoding microelectronic chips 
as a result  the semiconductor business may choose not to continue future development of the chips for any reason 
the semiconductor business may also encounter in the future technological difficulties in the production and development of the chips 
if the spun off semiconductor business is not able to or does not sustain its development and production efforts in this area  we may not be able to fully recognize the benefits of the acquisition 
see supply  license and development agreement at page of the joint proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   for further details of harmonic s business relationship with the spun off semiconductor business after the merger 
if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable  satellite  and other network operators  capital expenditures  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or services within broadband networks  and testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
as a result of the merger  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from solution contracts 
a substantial portion of cs division revenues are from solution contracts that include a combination of product sales as well as design  installation and integration services 
revenue forecasts for solution contracts are based on the estimated timing of the design  installation and integration of projects 
because the solution contracts generally span several quarters and revenue recognition is based on progress under the contract  the timing of revenue is difficult to predict and could result in lower than expected revenue in any particular quarter 

table of contents our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued united states patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively effect our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into such technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 
harmonic s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the telecommunications industry have extensive patent portfolios 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers 
indeed  a number of third parties  including leading companies  have asserted patent rights to technologies that are important to us 
we expect to increasingly be subject to infringement claims asserted by third parties as the numbers of products and competitors in the telecommunications industry grow 
in this regard  since december  we have been in communication with several of harmonic s customers who have been contacted by one of these leading companies that believes certain of our products require a license under a number of their patents 
we currently are reviewing the identified patents to examine whether we consider a license necessary 
while it is our understanding that the third party is willing to grant our customers a non exclusive license under the identified patents  there can be no assurance that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to our customers or that failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license would not cause our operating results to be materially adversely affected 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited 
table of contents suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increased reliance on subcontractors since the merger with c cube involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
in particular  certain optical components have in the past been in short supply and are available only from a small number of suppliers  including sole source suppliers 
while we expend considerable efforts to qualify additional optical component sources  consolidation of suppliers in the industry and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or subcontractors 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we have in the past and in the future may be subject to risk of excess and obsolete inventories  which could harm our business 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results for the last five quarters were adversely affected by excess and obsolete inventory charges of approximately million 
we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains two facilities in the state of israel with a total of approximately employees 
the personnel at these facilities represent a significant portion of our research and development operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could significantly harm our business 
the september terrorist attacks  the ongoing us war on terrorism and the escalation of terrorist attacks and hostilities within israel have heightened these risks 
we cannot assure you that the protraction or escalation of current tensions in the middle east will not adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
we are the subject of securities class action claims and other litigation which  if adversely determined  could harm our business and operating results 
between june and august   several actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws by harmonic and certain of its officers and directors some of whom are no longer with harmonic were filed in or removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the actions subsequently were consolidated 
a consolidated complaint  filed on december   was brought on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased harmonic s publicly traded securities between january and june  the complaint also alleged claims on behalf of a purported subclass of persons who purchased c cube securities between january and may  in addition to harmonic and certain of its officers and directors  the complaint also named c cube microsystems inc and several of its officers and directors as defendants 
the complaint alleged that  by making false or misleading statements regarding harmonic s prospects and customers and its acquisition of c cube  certain defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the complaint also alleged that certain defendants violated section a of the exchange act and sections  a  and of the securities act of by filing a false or misleading registration statement  prospectus  and joint proxy in connection with the c cube acquisition 
on july   the court dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend 
an amended complaint alleging the same claims against the same defendants was filed on august  defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on september  pursuant to the court s july  order  no hearing on the motions will be held unless the court sets one 

table of contents a derivative action purporting to be on behalf of harmonic was filed against its then current directors in the superior court for the county of santa clara on september  harmonic also was named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint is based on allegations similar to those found in the securities class actions and claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by  among other things  causing harmonic to violate federal securities laws 
the derivative action was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california on september  all deadlines in this action have been stayed pending resolution of the motions to dismiss the securities actions 
a case management conference is scheduled for april  based on its review of the complaints filed in the securities class action  harmonic believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously 
there can be no assurance  however  that harmonic will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in november  we were sued in tennessee state court by a company alleging breach of contract and breach of a tennessee statute relating to retailers and suppliers 
the suit has a claim for million and other unspecified damages  lost profits and attorneys fees 
the suit has since been removed to federal court and a trial date has been set for june harmonic believes that it has meritorious defenses and will defend the suit vigorously 
however  we cannot assure you that an unfavorable outcome will not adversely impact our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  particularly in recent years  and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current electrical and natural gas crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
we rely on a continuous power supply for manufacturing and to conduct our business operations 
interruptions in electrical power supplies in california in the early part of last year could recur in the future 
in addition  the cost of electricity and natural gas has risen significantly 
power outages could disrupt our manufacturing and business operations and those of many of our suppliers  and could cause us to fail to meet production schedules and commitments to customers and other third parties 
any disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers could result in damage to our current and prospective business relationships and could result in lost revenue and additional expenses  thereby harming our business and operating results 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
following implementation of the final phase of the euro changeover effective january   we expect a higher proportion of our european business to be denominated in euros which may subject us to increased foreign currency exchange risk 
in addition  the company has various international branch offices which provide sales support and systems integration services 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility 
harmonic does not use derivative instruments in its investment portfolio  and its investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of less than two years 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at estimated fair value  with material unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if harmonic were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity
