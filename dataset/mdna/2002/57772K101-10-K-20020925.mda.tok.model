item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements as noted in item a 
business combination in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired dallas semiconductor corporation  a leading supplier of specialty semiconductors 
the acquisition was undertaken as a result of the company s belief that the engineering talent  product offerings  and management philosophy at dallas semiconductor  when combined with those of the company  would lead to synergies that would positively impact operating results and increase stockholder value 
the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of dallas semiconductor 
in addition  the company exchanged all options to purchase dallas semiconductor common stock for options to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
as was permitted under applicable accounting rules in effect at the time  the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and qualifies as a tax free reorganization 
all financial data of the company presented in these financial statements was restated to include the historical financial data of dallas semiconductor in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and pursuant to regulation s x of the securities and exchange commission 
adjustments relating to deferral of income on shipments to distributors were required to conform to the accounting policies of the acquired company 
the company and dallas semiconductor had certain differences in the classification of revenues and expenses in their historical statements of income and assets and liabilities in their historical balance sheets 
adjustments were made to conform the combined company s income statement and balance sheet classifications 
in addition  the lives of the property  plant and equipment acquired as part of the merger with dallas semiconductor were conformed to the lives used by the company as appropriate 
the change  which was prospective in nature  reflects the company s anticipated economic benefit from those assets 
see note business combination of notes to consolidated financial statements at pages and results of operations net revenues the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a decrease from net revenues of  million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily related to downturns in certain industry segments particularly telecom and information technology businesses and in the general economy 
this downturn  which began in fiscal year  resulted in sequential quarter over quarter decreases in net revenues through the first quarter of fiscal year order rates stabilized during the first quarter of and throughout fiscal year resulting in net revenues increasing slightly quarter over quarter from the second quarter through the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a increase from net revenues of  million in fiscal year this increase was primarily related to higher unit shipments resulting from continued introduction of new proprietary products and increased market acceptance of the company s existing proprietary and second source products  and an increase in market demand for analog semiconductor products in general 
this increased demand resulted in net revenues being greater in the first  second  and third quarters of fiscal year than net revenues for the comparable quarters in fiscal year while net revenues increased from fiscal year to fiscal year  market demand for the company s products decreased significantly in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year due to downturns in certain industry segments particularly telecom and information technology businesses and in the general economy 
this resulted in net revenues being less in the fourth quarter of fiscal year than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents approximately   and of the company s net revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily in the pacific rim and europe 
while the majority of these sales are denominated in us dollars  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate its risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net revenues and the company s results of operations for fiscal years   and was immaterial 
gross margin the company s gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was attributable to lower fixed asset and inventory charges recorded during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this was offset slightly by a decrease in the company s gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year primarily as a result of revenue growth in lower margin products 
gross margin for fiscal year was negatively impacted by inventory write downs of million 
gross margin for fiscal year was negatively impacted by million recorded to reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation  and inventory write downs of million 
see critical accounting policies inventories at page the company s gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year was principally due to production efficiencies obtained through economies of scale and cost reductions 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal year was offset by million recorded to reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation and inventory write downs of million 
gross margin for fiscal year was negatively impacted by million recorded to reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation  and inventory write downs of million 
research and development research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars is due to no fixed asset charges recorded during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this was offset by increased headcount related expenses to continue product development to support revenue growth and increased wafer and mask expenses to support new product development 
included in research and development expenses in fiscal year was million recorded to reduce the carrying value of equipment  that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation 
research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year was due primarily to increased headcount related expenses to continue product development to support revenue growth  increased wafer and mask expense to support new product development  and million recorded to reduce the carrying value of equipment  that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation 
included in research and development expenses in fiscal year was million recorded to reduce the carrying value of equipment that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened resulting in accelerated depreciation 

table of contents the level of research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will vary from period to period  depending  in part  on the level of net revenues and  in part  on the company s success in recruiting the technical personnel needed for its new product introductions and process development 
the company continuously attempts to control and  if possible  reduce expense levels in all areas including research and development 
however  the company views research and development expenditures as critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions  which in turn are critical to the company s plan for future growth 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year is primarily due to lower sales representative commissions and decreased headcount related expenses due mainly to a reorganization of the combined company s sales organization completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition  there was a decrease of million in charges recorded for technology licensing 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal year was primarily due to additional headcount and related employee expenses to support the company s increased level of revenues offset by a decrease of million in charges recorded primarily for technology licensing 
merger and special charges as a result of the merger with dallas semiconductor  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded merger costs of approximately million 
these costs consisted of approximately million intended to satisfy the change in control payments under previously existing employment contracts and other non employee director arrangements for which there was no future economic benefit  a million payment to be made under a change in control provision in a previously existing life insurance arrangement for which there was no future economic benefit  and million for fees related to investment banking  legal  accounting  filings with regulatory agencies  financial printing  and other related costs 
approximately million of the direct transaction costs were paid out of existing cash reserves in fiscal year the remaining unpaid direct transaction costs of approximately million are related to change in control payments under previously existing employment contracts and other non employee director arrangements which will be paid out in future periods according to the terms of the related agreement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded special charges of million 
these special charges resulted from the significant decrease in demand that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year for dallas semiconductor s products in combination with the company s intention to close dallas semiconductor s inch wafer manufacturing facility and dispose of the related equipment 
the company intends to complete construction of an inch wafer manufacturing facility located in dallas  texas that was under construction when the merger was consummated between the company and dallas semiconductor 
once complete  the inch wafer manufacturing facility will serve as dallas semiconductor s primary wafer manufacturing facility 
in addition  the company planned to concentrate a significant portion of its test operations of the combined company at the company s test facilities located in the philippines and thailand 
the company concluded that the above facts indicated that dallas semiconductor s long lived assets might be impaired  and as required by accounting principles general accepted in the united states  performed a cash flow analysis of the related assets 
based on the cash flow analysis  the cash flows expected to be generated by dallas semiconductor s long lived assets during their estimated remaining useful lives were not sufficient to recover the net book value of the assets 
based on the cash flow analysis  an impairment charge of million was recorded to reduce the net book value of dallas semiconductor s long lived assets to fair value 
the company continued construction of the inch wafer manufacturing facility located in dallas  texas during fiscal year although at a slower pace than originally anticipated due to unforeseen complexities and resource constraints related to converting existing inch processes to inch processes 
the 
table of contents company plans to complete construction and start up of the inch wafer manufacturing facility in fiscal year the concentration of test operations of the combined company noted above was completed in fiscal year as planned 
in addition to the above  the company recorded special charges of million to reflect the reorganization of the company s sales organization  purchase order cancellation fees  and the reduction in the company s manufacturing workforce 
the above actions directly impacted employees in the company s sales  marketing  and manufacturing organizations 
the company terminated employees and employees in fiscal years and  respectively  and paid million and million in termination benefits in fiscal years and  respectively  related to the above actions 
during fiscal year  the company recorded additional special charges of million related to additional reductions in the company s manufacturing workforce 
these additional reductions were required to better match capacity with demand for the company s product 
in fiscal year  the company terminated an additional employees and paid an additional million of termination benefits related to these actions  bringing the total number of employees terminated to and the total termination benefits paid to million in fiscal year based on developments that occurred during fiscal year related to the special charges recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company revised its estimate of the reserve balance needed for purchase order cancellation fees 
based on the current status of negotiations  the amount that will ultimately be paid will be approximately million less than the amount recorded for such charges at june  accordingly  the company decreased the amount recorded for purchase order cancellation fees by million to reflect this change in estimate leaving a remaining reserve balance for purchase order cancellation fees of million at june  interest income and other  net interest income and other  net decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to lower levels of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment combined with lower average interest rates 
interest income and other  net increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in interest income and other  net in fiscal year was primarily due to significantly higher levels of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and higher average interest rates 
included in interest income and other  net in fiscal year was a million gain from the cash sale of the company s interest in its high frequency packaging and assembly subsidiary and a million gain from the sale of an investment in an unrelated test equipment company 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the fiscal years  and effective rates were lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits on export sales 
realization of the net deferred tax asset of million at june  is dependent primarily upon achieving future us taxable income of million 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future taxable income 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in item  business trends  risks and uncertainties at pages through an increase in the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company periodically assesses the need for increases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

table of contents outlook at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  backlog shippable within the next months was approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year  including approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year requested for shipment in the first quarter of fiscal year although the company s backlog grew in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  there is still limited visibility in many of its end markets 
because the company s backlog of orders at any point is not necessarily based on firm  noncancelable orders and because the company s customers do in fact routinely cancel orders for their own convenience with little notice  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  bookings were approximately million  a increase over the previous quarter s level of million 
turns orders remained high during the fourth quarter of fiscal year at of bookings turns orders are customer orders that are for delivery within the same quarter and may result in revenue within the same quarter if the company has available inventory that matches those orders 
the company s customers continue to order to support near term requirements 
turns orders received during the fourth quarter of fiscal year were million 
bookings increased in the us and japan and were approximately flat with the third quarter of fiscal year in other geographic areas 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year results were generally consistent with the company s expectations 
revenues increased approximately over the third quarter of fiscal year the company increased its revenues during the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal year  and the company forecasts that revenues will be up sequentially for the first quarter of fiscal the company believes that end market consumption of its products is close to its current bookings level 
as of the end of the second week of september  the company believes that its net revenues will be somewhat higher in the first quarter of fiscal year than in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  but the company does not have sufficient visibility based on current backlog and bookings to make confident predictions for future periods 
if the business climate does not recover to levels the company experienced a couple of years ago  the company believes it can still perform well for its stockholders 
the company is committed to finding the right mix of operating efficiencies and market success that will produce results for its stockholders 
to this end the company is implementing expense control and reduction plans throughout the company while at the same time continuing to focus on its new product and process introduction plans and completion of the manufacturing and other operational improvements discussed elsewhere in this report 
financial condition overview total assets decreased to  million at the end of fiscal year  down from  million at the end of fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock for million 
this decrease was offset by an increase in cash generated from operations of million in fiscal year and million from employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases 
accounts receivable declined to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year net inventory declined to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due to better matching of capacity with demand 
deferred tax assets grew to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year primarily due to timing differences between tax and financial reporting 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds for fiscal years   and has been from net cash generated from operating activities of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  the company received approximately million  million  and mil 
table of contents lion of proceeds from the exercises of stock options and purchases of common stock under the employee stock participation plan during fiscal years   and  respectively 
another source of cash from the company s stock option programs is the tax deductions that arise from exercise of options 
these tax benefits amounted to million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the principal uses of funds for fiscal years   and were repurchases of million  million  and million of the company s common stock  and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  million  and million  respectively 
in the past  it was the company s policy to reduce the dilution effect from stock options by repurchasing its common stock from time to time in amounts based on estimates of proceeds from stock option exercises and of tax benefits related to such exercises 
that stock repurchase policy was discontinued in the third quarter of fiscal year during the first and second quarters of fiscal year  the company repurchased common stock in response to actions taken by the securities and exchange commission following the extraordinary events of september  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company repurchased common stock as it was determined to be a more effective use of the company s funds rather than reinvesting maturing investments  which had a high rate of return  in securities that would have yielded a much lower rate of return 
the company will continue to repurchase its common stock in fiscal year the number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors  including the price of the company s common stock  general market conditions  and other factors 
see note common stock repurchases at pages and and note subsequent event at page of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding repurchases of common stock during and subsequent to fiscal year the company is subject to pending legal proceedings 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements at pages and for information regarding pending patent litigation 
although the results of such legal proceedings are unpredictable  the company does not believe that any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on its liquidity or financial position 
if  however  the appellate court in the action brought by linear technology corporation were to reverse the trial court s dismissal of the patent litigation claims brought by linear technology corporation against the company  and were linear technology corporation to prevail in its claims against the company  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
as of june   the company s available funds consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid investment securities 
the company anticipates that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements  including its anticipated level of capital expenditures and common stock repurchases  for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and its beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are 
table of contents inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impacts the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which impacts write offs of fixed assets  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision  and assessment of contingencies  which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
the company has other key accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances revenue from product sales to the company s direct customers is recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of the company s sales is made to domestic distributors under agreements that provide the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these distributors  the company defers recognition of such sales until the product is sold by the domestic distributors to their end customers 
revenue on all shipments to international distributors is recognized upon shipment to the distributor  when the above criteria are met  with appropriate provision of reserves for returns and allowances  as these distributors generally do not have price rebate or product return privileges 
the company estimates the provision for returns and price rebates based on historical experience and known future returns and price rebates 
accounts receivable from both domestic and international distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point the company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms 
the company must make estimates of potential future product returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  changes in customer demand  and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowances 
estimates made by the company may differ from actual product returns and sales allowances 
these differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
because of the cyclicality of the market  inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  the company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on backlog  forecasted product demand  and historical sales levels 
backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations  and rescheduling 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those projected by the company 
this difference could have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin should inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by the company  gross margin could be favorably impacted 
during fiscal year and  the company had inventory write downs of million and million  respectively  due to decreases in backlog and forecasted demand due to a downturn in certain industry segments particularly telecom and information technology businesses and the general economy 
the company s standard cost revision policy is to continuously monitor manufacturing variances and revise standard costs when necessary 
the company s policy for recording a write down of inventory is generally to write down  at standard cost  finished goods inventory in excess of an estimate of twelve months of demand based on backlog and historical sales levels and work in process that is greater than days old  which has no forecasted product demand 

table of contents long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company performs periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable  the company compares projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful life against their respective carrying amounts 
in the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets 
evaluation of impairment of property  plant and equipment requires estimates in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of the company s property  plant and equipment could differ from the company s estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in additional impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
as previously noted  in fiscal year  the company recorded a charge of million for the impairment of dallas semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and test equipment 
the impairment charge was determined based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value attributable to such assets 
additionally  in fiscal year and  the company recorded charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation 
the charges noted above were classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas and requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the company adopted sfas effective june  and believes that this standard will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
accounting for income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practicable tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment could increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
at june  the company recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset of million attributable to the expected tax benefits on gains to be realized from the exercise of stock options  which if and when realized  will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital 
on a periodic basis the company evaluates its deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
the company s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to 
table of contents these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
contingencies from time to time  the company receives notices that its products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
the company periodically assesses each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  management may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information obtained combined with management s judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  the company determines whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  the company records a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  the company takes into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations which may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect  the company may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
alternatively  if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur  the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thus favorably impacting the company s results of operations 
see item  legal proceedings at page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which includes primarily us treasury and federal agency debt securities 
investments mature at frequent intervals during the year  at which time the funds are available for use in the business  or for reinvestment  as cash demands dictate 
the company places its investments only in high quality financial instruments  limits the amount invested in any one institution or instrument  and limits portfolio duration 
this policy is intended to reduce default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio and related interest income would not be materially impacted by a change in market interest rates of basis points  due to the primarily short term nature of the company s investment portfolio 
at june   the company s investment portfolio had an expected weighted average return of at june  and a weighted maturity of days days at june  
foreign currency risk the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the japanese yen  british pound  and the euro 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary 
the company has established risk management strategies designed to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates 
these strategies reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange movements 
currency forward contracts are used to offset the currency risk of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the related currency forward contract 
the net realized and unrealized gains or losses from hedging non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities was immaterial in fiscal year the company had forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies with a us dollar equivalent of million at june  the fair value of these contracts  which generally have maturities of less than months  at june  was million
