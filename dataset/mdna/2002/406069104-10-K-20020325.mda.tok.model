item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the discussion in this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
additional information relating to forward looking statements is included in this report under the caption special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we source and deliver the most critical component of the technology industry human capital 
as a leading talent source for the technology industry  we provide specialized it professionals on a short term contract and permanent basis primarily to vendors and users of technology 
we have offices located in geographic markets 
our contract services group provides specialized it professionals on a short term contract basis and accounted for approximately of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and in our permanent placement services group provides specialized it professionals on a permanent basis and accounted for approximately of our net revenues in  in and in our net revenues are derived principally from the hourly billings of our it professionals on contract assignments and from fees received for permanent placements 
contract services assignments typically last four to six months  and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
we derive contract services revenues when our consultants are working  and therefore our operating results may be adversely affected when client facilities are closed due to holidays or inclement weather 
as a result  we typically experience relatively lower net revenues in our first fiscal quarter compared to our other fiscal quarters 
we derive permanent placement revenues upon permanent placement of each it professional candidate 
the fee is typically structured as a percentage of the placed it professional s first year annual compensation 
permanent placement revenues are recognized when an it professional commences employment or  in the case of retained searches  upon completion of our contractual obligations 
as a result of current general economic slowdown  we reported a decrease in revenue  gross profit  and income in while no one customer represents greater than of our total revenue  we do have a number of larger customers  some of which have issued earnings warnings and delayed a number of their projects 
due to these economic conditions  net revenues decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease 
over this same period  we decreased  through restructuring or attrition  the number of sales  sales support and administrative employees to individuals in geographic markets from individuals in geographic markets at the end of  representing a decrease in headcount 
the number of revenue producing sales and sales support employees included in the overall headcount decreased to at the end of from at the end of  a decrease 
the restructuring of operations and the write down due to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with a number of acquisitions resulted in substantial increases in our operating expenses 
if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  we may continue to experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
based on the results of our ongoing reviews  we decided in to close several offices  reduce our workforce  and restructure the organizational management and operations 
in  a number of our customers experienced serious cash flow constraints  causing us concern regarding the collectability of our accounts receivable 
bankruptcies  company closures  and delinquencies have resulted in a direct accounts receivable write off of million  of which million was considered to be in excess of our historical write off levels 
in addition  we increased our bad debt reserve by million 
historically  bad debt write offs have generally not exceeded of revenue and in and we recorded write offs of and million  respectively 
while we believe that the remaining current balances are collectible  economic conditions are still a cause for concern and we will continue to analyze the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in july we completed a tender offer to exchange outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock having an exercise price per share of or more for new options at current market price 
employee options to purchase  shares of common stock at an average price of were cancelled as of july  and new option grants to purchase  shares  equivalent to of the shares represented by the continuing options tendered  were issued at per share on january  critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company reserves and estimates for adjustments to the timing and realization of permanent placement services revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  and the valuation of net deferred tax assets  and the impairment of property and equipment  and goodwill 
reserves and estimates for adjustments to the timing and realization of permanent placement services revenue revenues for permanent placement services are recognized upon the commencement of employment or upon the completion of services rendered based on contractual obligation 
however  permanent placement revenue is subject to contractual guarantees and commitments as to the acceptance by both the candidate and the client of employment terms and timing 
therefore  we establish reserves for potential guarantee issues  refunds or other adjustments that may arise 
the estimates and reserves are based on reported commencement dates and historical rates of adjustments and are reviewed for adequacy periodically 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for potential losses in revenue  permanent placement services are highly sensitive to changes in the employment rate and other economic conditions 
it is possible that these estimates will change in the near future and the actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates and significantly impact revenues and operating results 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we establish allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we reported a direct accounts receivable write off of million resulting from bankruptcies  company closures and delinquencies of payment of accounts receivable 
valuation of net deferred tax assets the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  additional taxes or valuation allowances may be required to adjust the carrying value  resulting in additional tax expense 
management evaluates the realizability and net carrying value of the deferred tax assets quarterly 
impairment of property and equipment  and goodwill the carrying value of property and equipment and the recoverability of goodwill are based on assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  additional expense may be recorded to reflect the impairment of these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we will be required to analyze goodwill for impairment issues by june and on a periodic basis thereafter 
during  we reported reductions in carrying value of property and equipment of million in connection with restructuring of operations and impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of million

we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in october as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have no availability under the credit facility as of december  net cash used for financing activities for was million  due primarily to the funds advanced for and repurchases of common stock  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
at december  cash and cash equivalents were million 
we believe that our cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least twelve months 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement was effective for our fiscal year ending in december  and will not be applied retroactively to the financial statements of prior periods 
we have not engaged in any transactions requiring the use of sfas no 
 accordingly sfas no 
has no effect on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal year and ceased the amortization of goodwill with a net carrying value of million that resulted from business combinations completed prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in respect to sfas nos 
and  we have not yet performed the impairment test required by the standard 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal year we have not completed the evaluation of the effects  if any  of adopting fas item a quantitative and qualificative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we have million in cash and cash equivalents and million in other investments that are invested in the highest rated commercial paper and money market funds 
if short term interest rates were to decrease percent  the decrease would not have a material impact on our net income or cash flows 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
historically  borrowings and repayments under our revolving line of credit facilities represented the most significant components of cash provided by or used for financing activities 
however  we are not in compliance with all of the terms of the agreement as of december  as a result  no borrowings are available 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the united kingdom pound is the functional currency in our subsidiary in the united kingdom and the japanese yen is the functional currency in our branch office in japan 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the united kingdom pound and japanese yen 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at december   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
