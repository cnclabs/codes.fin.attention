item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements  which appear elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs  including without limitation forward looking statements regarding trends in operating expenses  the adequacy of our capital reserves and our future need for additional capital 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors 
overview ista was founded to discover  develop and market new remedies for diseases and conditions of the eye 
our product development efforts are focused on using highly purified formulations of the enzyme hyaluronidase to treat diseases and conditions such as vitreous hemorrhage  diabetic retinopathy and corneal opacification 
our lead product candidate  vitrase  is a proprietary drug for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage and diabetic retinopathy 
in march  we completed the acquisition of visionex  a singapore corporation  which has been conducting a phase ii clinical trial of vitrase in singapore 
visionex was a related party through common ownership by some of our stockholders 
we are planning to significantly wind down the operations of visionex in upon completion of the phase ii clinical trial of vitrase in singapore 
in march  we began a collaboration with allergan  under which allergan will be responsible for the marketing  sale and distribution of vitrase in the united states and all international markets  except mexico and japan 
we will be dependent on the success of allergan in commercializing vitrase in these markets 
our principal sources of revenue from this collaboration and the commercialization of vitrase will be milestone  royalty and profit sharing payments received from allergan 
under the terms of the collaboration  we are responsible for the manufacture of vitrase and for supplying all of allergan s requirements for vitrase 
if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for vitrase and allergan achieves significant sales of the product  our aggregate manufacturing costs will increase 
in december  we began a collaboration with otsuka under which otsuka will be responsible for all clinical development  regulatory approvals  sales and marketing activities for vitrase in japan 
our principal sources of revenue from this collaboration and the commercialization of vitrase will be the license fee received in december and amortized over the company s continuing involvement with otsuka  milestone payments and product sales received from otsuka 
under the terms of the collaboration  we are responsible for the manufacture of vitrase and supplying all of otsuka s requirements for vitrase 
in december  we announced our strategic plan to transition from a development organization to a fully integrated  specialty pharmaceutical company with a primary focus on ophthalmology by acquiring complimentary products  either already marketed or in development 
in march  we announced the preliminary results for our phase iii clinical studies of vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage 
data from the two phase iii studies did not show a statistically significant improvement in the primary surrogate endpoint 
we intend to meet with the fda as soon as possible to discuss the results of our phase iii studies 
those discussions may result in a requirement that we conduct additional phase iii clinical studies to support regulatory approval or a decision by us to terminate further development of vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage 
we cannot assure you that we will conduct additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval of vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage  or  if we conduct additional studies  that the results will support the filing or approval of a nda 
we currently have no products available for sale 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit through december  of million 
our losses have resulted primarily from research and development activities  including clinical trials  related general and administrative expenses and a deemed dividend to our preferred shareholders 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as 
table of contents we continue our research and development and clinical testing activities  and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates 
critical accounting policies estimates we intend to recognize revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless the amounts received are creditable against royalties or we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue

research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for our lead product candidate vitrase 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to preclinical research  clinical development and manufacturing development 
we have not tracked our historical research and development costs by specific project  rather  we track costs by the type of cost incurred 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for preclinical research  approximately was spent on clinical development and approximately was spent on manufacturing development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in changes in our research and development expenses are primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs for decreased by  from the decrease in clinical costs in was due to the focus of our clinical efforts primarily on our phase iii clinical trials for vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage and the completion of two other clinical trials that we had commenced in as a result  our overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator site fees  study monitoring costs and data management  decreased in as compared to personnel costs personnel costs  including outside consultant expenses  for increased by  from the increase is primarily attributable to expenses for consultants to assist us with clinical data compilation  review and analysis in preparation of the filing of the nda for vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage and the increase of our research and development staffing from at december  to at december  direct research costs research costs for decreased by  from this decrease is principally attributable to a reduction in the number of pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted by contract research organizations 

table of contents manufacturing development costs contract manufacturing costs for increased by  from the increase in manufacturing development costs was due to increased activities in connection with the preparations for commercial scale manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in vitrase at biozyme and pre production activities by sp pharmaceuticals  inc general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the million increase in was primarily attributable to increases in personnel and operating expenses  including expenses associated with the resignation of an officer of the company and non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants 
stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees and directors is the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date the options were granted 
deferred compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  sfas  interpretation no

stock option compensation for non employees is recorded as the related services are rendered and the value of compensation is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
for the year ended december   we granted stock options to employees to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we anticipate recording deferred compensation expense of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  related to these option grants 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded amortization of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was  in   in and  in the decrease in interest income in is primarily attributable to forgiveness of  in accrued interest relating to a loan made to a former company officer  who resigned in the increase in interest income in over the prior year was directly attributable to higher cash balances as a result of our financing activities 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  in   in and  in interest expense incurred during and was primarily attributable to our capital leases 
interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums 
the company had no capital leases during deemed dividend

at the time of the acquisition  we recorded million of tangible assets acquired and recognized a deemed dividend of million for the excess of the extended value of the shares issued over the net tangible assets acquired 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously 
table of contents utilized 
approximately million of the california tax loss carryforwards expired in we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of ista s unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december  this data has been derived from our unaudited interim financial statements which  in our opinion  have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods presented 
these unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with ista s financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report

 unaudited costs and expenses research development general administrative total costs expenses interest income expense net net loss deemed dividend for preferred stockholders net loss attributable to common stockholders net loss per common share  basic and diluted research development expenses 
during  our quarterly research and development expenses decreased primarily as a result of our concentration of our activities on vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage and the deferral of other development activities relating to our other product candidates 
vitrase development activities included the completion of patient enrollment in our two phase iii clinical trials  collection and review of clinical data from study sites around the world  improvements in the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturers and preparations for the submission of an nda to the fda 
general administrative expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred higher expenses related to increases in personnel and operating expenses from prior quarters in and increases in personnel and operating expenses consisted of non cash compensation associated with stock option grants  legal expenses relating to our collaboration with otsuka  the establishment of a shareholder rights plan  and expenses in connection with the resignation of a company officer 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments and working capital of million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to fund operations for the next months 
however  we currently plan to seek additional funding during we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of our common and preferred stock and the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering 
we received net proceeds of million 
table of contents from the private sale of preferred stock in march  million from our initial public offering in august  million from the private sale of common stock in december and million from a license fee payment in december during we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of million and million of deferred income 
in  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by the non cash compensation expense of approximately million 
in  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million offset by non cash compensation expense of approximately million and an increase in accrued expenses of million related to clinical trials 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million during compared to million invested in during  million of cash was invested 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities in is primarily attributable to the sale of short term investments to fund our research and development efforts and general operating expenses 
during  the proceeds from our initial public offering were used to purchase short term marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in and million in the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to the million proceeds from the private sale of common stock to otsuka during december  while the increase in cash provided by financing activities in is related to the completion of our initial public offering in august  with net proceeds of million  and million from the private sale of preferred stock in march we will need to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of vitrase for the treatment of severe vitreous hemorrhage  fund further development of our other product candidates and to acquire or in license products and technology beyond this period 
alternatives to raise additional funds include borrowings  lease arrangements  collaborative research and development arrangements with technology companies  the licensing of product rights to third parties or additional public and private financing 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our product development efforts or may limit our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress of our research and development programs the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals activities in connection with the in license or acquisition of products and technologies our ability to establish and maintain collaborative relationships receiving milestone payments from allergan and otsuka competitive  technological  market and other developments 
table of contents visionex acquisition visionex was established in  under the laws of singapore  to engage in clinical  regulatory and marketing activities 
during  visionex obtained from us the exclusive rights to register  import  market  sell and distribute vitrase and keraform in east asian markets  excluding japan and korea  for which visionex paid us million 
although we had no ownership interest in visionex  their incorporation was funded concurrently with our june  series c preferred stock financing round at which time three of the visionex investors were already existing shareholders of ista 
upon the formation of visionex  we had no ownership interest in visionex  but investors owning of ista also owned of visionex 
prior to the acquisition of visionex on march  as discussed below  investors who owned of ista shares controlled of visionex shares 
in addition  three of the five board members of visionex at december  were also board members of ista 
upon incorporation of visionex  we entered into a call option agreement with visionex and its shareholders whereby we could have required the shareholders to exchange their outstanding shares of visionex stock for our stock 
the visionex shares would have been exchanged at a rate  depending upon the annual revenues of visionex  as defined in the agreement  ranging from  up to  shares of our common stock or  if we had not yet completed an initial public offering  our series c preferred stock 
the call option could have been exercised by us at any time during the two year period beginning june   but could have been deferred for a period of up to two years by a majority of the holders of the visionex shares 
the call option agreement also provided for a put option whereby each of the visionex shareholders could have required us to purchase the outstanding preference shares of visionex held by such shareholder 
the per share purchase price to be paid by us under the put option was shares of our common stock or  if we had not yet completed an initial public offering  our series c preferred stock up to a maximum of  shares 
the put option was exercisable at any time in the three year period beginning june  on march   we negotiated an agreement with the visionex shareholders and issued  shares of our series c preferred stock  convertible into  shares of our common stock  to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of visionex 
we assigned a fair value of per share to the  shares of series c preferred stock issued to effect the acquisition  at which time we recorded a deemed dividend of million to recognize the excess of the value of the shares issued over the net assets acquired 
we decided to significantly wind down the operations of visionex in following the completion of the phase ii clinical trial of vitrase  which visionex has been conducting for us in singapore 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which we adopted on january  sfas no 
sets forth a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition of derivatives and hedging activities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition when adopted as we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities 
in march  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of accounting practice board apb opinion no 

fin clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin became effective on july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  upon adoption  fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interest method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets 
table of contents acquired in a business combination that is completed after june  sfas no 
no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amortization of goodwill included in investments in equity investees will also no longer be recorded upon adoption of the new rules 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective january   and do not anticipate the adoption to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations as we do not have intangible assets recorded on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
while earlier application is encouraged  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
we have operated primarily in the united states and have had no sales to date 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
visionex s functional currency is the singapore dollar and a portion of visionex s business is conducted in currencies other than the singapore dollar 
however  visionex s operations have historically been insignificant and we currently plan for the orderly cessation of visionex operations 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the singapore dollar and the currencies in which visionex does business will cause foreign currency translation gains and losses 
we do not expect our foreign currency translation gains or losses to be material 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure
