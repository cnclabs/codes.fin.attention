industry background the life sciences research industry is undergoing fundamental change  resulting principally from the explosive growth in gene discovery and the increasing demand for greater efficiency in the drug discovery and development process 
pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america estimated that in the year  major pharmaceutical companies spent approximately billion worldwide on drug discovery research and development 
advances in genomics  combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening have significantly enhanced the drug discovery process 
the publication  science estimated that the sequencing of the human genome would provide an estimated  to  relevant new drug targets over the next ten 
table of contents years 
chemists have been able to make these advances in drug discovery by using new tools that simplify  automate and accelerate the drug discovery process 
chemists are discovering a large number of new drug candidates that are ready for the drug development process through widespread use of these tools 
however  the pharmaceutical industry does not have sufficient tools and resources to fully exploit the opportunities presented by advances in drug discovery due to the technological limitations of traditional chemistry development for new drugs 
chemical discovery and development the process of discovering potential chemicals  which could prove useful as new medicines  involves a number of steps that can best be understood in the context of two phases discovery phase 
discovery is the process by which biologists and chemists develop drug targets identified through biology  including genomics and proteomics  the study of protein function  into biological screens 
chemists then test the millions of compounds produced by combinatorial chemistry using high throughput biological screens to identify possible chemical leads that could be drug candidates 
development phase 
chemists optimize the pharmacological potency  pharmacokinetic availability and specificity and toxicology safety of chemical leads for human testing and approval during the development phase 
the development phase can be further broken down into three stages lead identification 
during lead identification  chemists evaluate the hundreds of potential lead chemicals that could be drug candidates which may emerge from the discovery phase using a process 
chemists perform successive rounds of chemical syntheses to create numerous variants of the drug candidates to find compounds likely to have appropriate drug properties 
they then work to optimize these compounds for their biological potency  thus creating lead compounds 
lead optimization 
in pre clinical development  chemists further refine a limited number of lead compounds into clinical drug candidates by applying additional chemistry methodologies in the pre clinical development process 
during this process  chemists make relatively small changes to the compounds in order to optimize their safety and pharmacokinetic properties 
process development 
during clinical development  chemists test clinical drug candidates in humans to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness  or efficacy 
the successful outcome of clinical trails may result in regulatory approval to commercialize the new drug product 
during this phase of development  chemists optimize the methods by which they will manufacture much larger quantities of the compound being tested 
manufacturing process development involves optimizing the chemical synthesis process in order to yield much larger quantities of the drug than were needed in the previous development phases 
by optimizing and selecting the most effective method of compound synthesis  chemists reduce the cost of synthesis 
this may be achieved by reducing the number of products used in synthesis  improving the yield of the desired compound and accelerating the time needed for synthesis 
traditional chemistry methods for chemical development chemists typically employ traditional chemistry synthesis methods in their drug development efforts 
utilizing traditional methods of chemical synthesis  a chemist performs a series of chemical reactions  or transformations  until the desired compound is obtained 
chemists generally achieve each transformation in a four part process set up and execution of reaction chemists build a reaction apparatus as the first step in chemical synthesis 
chemists often construct the apparatus using a variety of traditional laboratory components depending on the type of chemistry they are performing 
chemists use the apparatus to combine chemicals  reagents and solutions  which the chemist will often heat or cool to specified temperatures under air and moisture free  or inert  conditions 
the chemist then 
table of contents monitors reactions over time to determine reaction progress 
in traditional chemistry development  the assembly of a specific apparatus and the periodic addition of chemicals can often be very complicated and time consuming depending on the complexity of the desired reaction 
product work up chemists perform a product work up as the second step in chemical synthesis 
once the chemist determines that a reaction has proceeded to completion  the chemist subjects the reaction mixture to an extensive reaction work up 
during the work up the chemist stops the reaction and carries out an initial cleanup of the reaction mixture prior to purification 
the chemist performs a series of washes with a variety of solvents  a drying process and a filtration process during the work up 
the chemist usually takes several hours to complete this labor intensive work up process 
product purification chemists perform product purification as the third step in chemical synthesis 
during this step  the chemist isolates the desired product from its starting materials and various byproducts 
product purification is an integral step in chemical synthesis due to the fact that impurities may interfere in the next chemical transformation or mask a drug s potency and toxicity 
chemists typically utilize large volumes of different solvents during the purification process 
this step often takes the chemists days to complete 
product analysis chemists perform product analysis as the final step in chemical synthesis 
in this step  the chemist confirms that the desired drug has been synthesized and isolated before continuing on in the synthetic pathway or submitting the compound for biological testing 
analysis requires a large amount of data collection and is labor intensive 
chemists must repeat this laborious  four step process until the desired compound is obtained 
the synthesis of a particular compound could take months and even years to complete before researchers can determine whether the compound has the desired drug properties 
limitations of existing chemical development technologies traditional chemistry development methods have the following limitations limited productivity 
traditional methods are time consuming  inefficient and labor intensive 
industry experts estimate that chemists can create approximately compounds per year using the traditional approach of performing one reaction at a time 
since it is not economically feasible for pharmaceutical companies to employ chemists in the large numbers necessary to take advantage of the thousands of expected drug targets  we believe that efficiency  or throughput in the development phase must increase dramatically 
long drug development timelines 
traditional methods require chemists to synthesize compounds one at a time in an inefficient  sequential process 
this results in long drug development timelines  which delay product commercialization and reduce the commercial value of the exclusivity period provided by patent protection 
high cost 
traditional methods are expensive due to the time and labor required of a chemist to produce a single compound 
in addition  companies utilizing the traditional methods incur the costs associated with the high volumes of solvents and chemicals utilized and the expense associated with their disposal 
high drug candidate failures 
traditional methods limit the number of compounds synthesized  which can lead to companies or chemists selecting sub optimal drug candidates  often resulting in drug candidate failures 
these failures greatly increase the average length of time and cost required to bring a specific drug to market 
if a drug candidate fails during clinical trials  a company must incur the time and expense of repeating all of the development steps or face abandoning the project altogether 
the 
table of contents cost of a failed candidate increases significantly as it progresses to later stages of the development process 
lack of flexibility 
to date  chemists have lacked flexible tools and systems to easily perform the wide variety of complex experiments required for chemistry development 
instead  chemists have had to repeatedly assemble various components into complicated systems 
difficulty of use 
the steps required for a chemist to put together an apparatus and perform the reaction  work up  purification and product analysis are difficult to execute 
therefore  many of these complex chemistries require skilled chemists with many years of training 
these limitations restrict the ability of pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to fully capitalize on the large number of new drug candidates resulting from the significant technical advances in drug discovery 
in order to take advantage of these advances  we believe that pharmaceutical and life sciences companies will need to increase productivity  shorten the drug development process and reduce costs 
we believe that these objectives will be achieved through advances and innovations in chemistry development technologies and tools 
the argonaut solution we design  manufacture and market instruments and reagents that increase the productivity of chemists  thereby accelerating and improving the chemical development process  and therefore  the likelihood of developing a successful new drug 
our products enable chemists to rapidly synthesize a wide range of compounds at a reduced cost 
we design and develop products using extensive customer assessment  validation and testing 
we intend to promote our products as the laboratory standard for chemists and the industry standard for companies seeking more efficient methods of addressing their increasing drug development needs 
we believe our technology provides the following key benefits over traditional chemistry development methods increased productivity we design our systems to simultaneously synthesize many distinct chemical compounds by automating many of the labor intensive aspects of the experiments 
using our systems  chemists can save significant time and effort while performing a greater number of experiments 
chemists can create approximately compounds per year using the traditional approach of performing one reaction at a time 
the same chemist can create between  to  compounds per year  using our products 
reduced drug development timelines through parallel synthesis and automation  our products enable chemists to optimize drug candidates faster by producing a significantly larger number of compounds in less time than traditional methods 
by simultaneously producing numerous variants of drug candidates  our tools provide more comprehensive information for the management by chemists of drug development projects 
our customers can identify and accelerate the development of promising drug candidates through the use of improved data  thus reducing drug development timelines 
reduced costs we believe that reactions performed in our systems versus those performed using traditional chemistry methods for development could result in significant cost savings per compound by allowing chemists to reduce labor hours and solvent usage 
in addition  by synthesizing more drug candidates  our products provide greater amounts of information and enable companies to abandon poor drug candidates sooner  thereby eliminating the costs associated with later stage drug failures 

table of contents improved intellectual property positions chemists can significantly increase the number of chemical compounds synthesized by using our tools 
as a result  we believe that pharmaceutical companies may be able to improve their patent and other intellectual property positions by submitting more detailed claims with their patent applications covering a wider variety of compounds 
flexibility our products are flexible and chemists can perform a wide range of chemical reactions  from simple reactions to complex  multi step reactions that require inert environments using our tools

overview we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our instrument products 
we commenced commercial shipment of our first generation instrument  the nautilus  in  the quest product line in  the trident product line in and the surveyor and the endeavor in revenue from sales of our instrument products is recognized when delivery and installation of the product is complete 
we also derive revenues from the sale of reagents and other instrument related consumables  as well as revenues derived from products and integration services in connection with the acquisition of atsi completed on march  our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and general and administrative costs associated with our operations  and the expansion of our sales and marketing organization 
our research and development expenses may increase in the future as we continue to develop our products 
our selling and marketing expenses may increase as we continue to expand the geographic coverage of our direct sales and support organization 
recent developments acquisition of jones group on february   we completed the acquisition of jones group  a privately held chemistry consumables and instrumentation company headquartered in cardiff  wales  uk pursuant to a share purchase agreement  dated february  the jones group became a wholly owned subsidiary of argonaut and will continue to operate out of its current cardiff  wales  uk locations

table of contents acquisition of camile products llc on march   we completed the acquisition of camile products  llc  pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization  dated january  camile became a wholly owned subsidiary of argonaut  and operates as argonaut technologies systems  inc atsi and continues to operate out of its current indianapolis  indiana location 
atsi markets software that allows pharmaceutical and chemical companies to automate and precisely control chemical reactions 
atsi specializes in automating research and pilot scale reactors with personal computer based software solutions 
atsi s graphical user interface for the software increases efficiencies allowing chemists more time to focus on scientific discoveries 
we acquired atsi in a purchase accounting transaction for million in cash and  shares of common stock 
a portion of the cash and common stock will be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of reorganization 
reduction in force in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring program to downsize our organizational structure in order to reduce operating expenses and improve workforce processes and efficiencies 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  which includes termination benefits and related expenses of  related to a reduction of our workforce by employees and expenses of  for abandonment of excess equipment 
impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets downturns in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical industries have negatively impacted the forecasted revenues and expected cash flows from atsi 
the comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the related purchased intangible assets resulted in an impairment of the assets acquired  and a write down of these assets of approximately million during our fourth quarter of fiscal  in accordance with our accounting policies 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of investments  inventory adjustments  warranty liabilities  restructuring charge  purchase accounting  impairment of long lived assets and income tax to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for each arrangement  we determine whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  collectibility is reasonably assured and fees are fixed and determinable 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until all of the criteria are met 
product revenue revenue related to product sales with no future obligation is recognized upon shipment when the recognition criteria have been met 
for those products where we have obligations to provide installation services  revenue is recognized upon installation when the recognition criteria have been met 
sales that require customer acceptance are not recognized as revenue until the requirements have been met 

table of contents revenue arrangements with significant implementation services in certain circumstances  we enter into revenue arrangements whereby we sell to our customer products with significant implementation services 
we recognize revenue for these arrangements using the percentage of completion method of accounting unless we are unable to make reasonable estimates under that method  in which case revenue is recognized on a completed contract basis 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes known 
service revenue maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  trainings and other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which is included in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the composition of our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering our customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
investments investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out cost method or market value 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon the forecasted plans to sell our inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents restructuring during fiscal year  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our restructuring program 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and related abandonment of excess equipment 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
purchase accounting we accounted for the acquisition of atsi under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and valuations 
the remaining values are based on our judgments and estimates  and accordingly  the company s financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  we review long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
under sfas  an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
income tax we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
stock compensation deferred stock compensation is the difference between the exercise price of the options and the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value was determined based on the business factors underlying the value of our common stock on the date of grant viewed in light of our initial public offering in july and the anticipated initial public offering price per share 
the deferred stock compensation was recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options  generally four years  using the graded vesting method 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in the year ended december  and approximately million in the year ended december  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees 
we have recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately million  approximately million  and approximately  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of approximately million to be amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
we also recorded stock compensation of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  in connection with options granted to consultants 
these options are periodically remeasured as they vest  in accordance with emerging issues task force no 

table of contents in  we granted performance based options to certain of our employees and recorded a stock compensation expense of  in none in on the date the performance criteria were met and the options were vested 
at december   the company has  options subject to performance criteria 
we will record additional stock compensation expense on the remaining unvested options when and if they vest 
comparative results of operations years ended december  and net sales net sales in were million compared to million in the decrease was substantially attributable to reduced unit volume sales of instrument products as a result of the general economic slowdown and more careful scrutiny of capital expenditures by our customers 
a substantially offsetting factor was the additional net sales of approximately million that was generated from products and services in connection with our acquisition of atsi on march  cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to retrofit costs associated with the more recently introduced surveyor and endeavor products and the additional costs typically associated with early production units 
in addition  gross margin performance attributable to products and services in connection with atsi are historically lower overall 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of this increase is attributable to additional r d personnel  facility expenses and other related spending in connection with atsi 
we incurred additional spending for outside professional services related to process improvement initiatives targeted at redesigning our product development processes 
as a partial offset to these expenses  stock based compensation expense was approximately  less in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in primary factors contributing to this increase were additional expenses attributable to the addition of atsi related headcount and related expenses aggregating approximately million  the first full year of additional expenses operating as a public company  and facility related relocation expenses as referred to above 
as a partial offset to these increased expenses  stock based compensation expense was approximately million less in compared to impairment charge  amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets was million for fiscal representing the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of atsi on march  goodwill and other purchased intangible assets were preliminarily amortized based on estimated useful lives of years 
at december   the purchase price allocation was finalized  resulting in modifications to the estimated useful lives of the individual intangible assets 
goodwill is amortized over years and other purchased intangible assets are amortized over to years 

table of contents in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  we review long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
under sfas  an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
downturns in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical industries have negatively impacted the forecasted revenues and expected cash flows from atsi 
the comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the related purchased intangible assets resulted in an impairment of the assets acquired  and a write down of these assets of approximately million during our fourth quarter of fiscal  in accordance with our policy 
acquired in process research and development expense during fiscal  we recorded  of acquired in process research and development ipr d resulting from the acquisition of atsi 
this amount was expensed on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
there can be no assurance that acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future will not result in substantial charges for ipr d that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
developed technology and ipr d were identified and valued through extensive interviews  analysis of data provided by atsi concerning developmental products  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  if applicable  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and ipr d 
where developmental projects had reached technological feasibility  they were classified as developed technology  and the value assigned to developed technology was capitalized 
where the developmental projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses  they were classified as ipr d and charged to expense upon closing of the acquisition 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
in valuing the ipr d  we considered  among other factors  the importance of each project to the overall development plan  projected incremental cash flows from the projects when completed and any associated risks 
the projected incremental cash flows were discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of 
the discount rate was determined after consideration of our weighted average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring program to downsize our organizational structure in order to reduce operating expenses and improve workforce processes and efficiencies 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  which includes termination benefits and related expenses of  related to a reduction of our workforce by employees and expenses of  for abandonment of excess equipment 
remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction will be paid in the first two quarters 
table of contents of fiscal the restructuring program is expected to yield cash savings of approximately million annually  beginning in fiscal these savings largely relate to reduced employee related costs and are expected to be realized primarily in operating expenses 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income of million in compared to million in this increase reflects the net effect of higher average balances of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in july  substantially offset by reduced interest rate yields consistent with the overall interest rate decline of high quality short term financial instruments 
interest and other expense was  in compared to  in as a result of the continuing reduction of the company s debt obligations 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively  which expire on various dates between and utilization of our net operating loss may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
years ended december  and net sales net sales in were million compared to million in the increase was substantially attributable to the introduction of three new instrument products in along with higher sales in other instruments and chemistry products 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to higher sales volume 
gross margins as a percentage of net sales in declined slightly compared to this is attributable to the recently launched surveyor and endeavor products with additional costs typically associated with early production units offset by improved margins in the chemistry products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses include salaries and related costs of research and development personnel as well as the costs of parts and supplies associated with research and development projects 
personnel levels and related expenses remained relatively constant during both periods 
the increase is primarily attributable to stock based compensation charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for executive  sales and marketing  finance and other administrative personnel and the costs of facilities 
the increase was attributable to further expansion of our direct sales force in the united states and europe and the recruitment and placement of a general manager for our european subsidiary during the increase also includes million of stock based compensation charges incurred in versus  in 
table of contents interest and other income expense net interest and other income was million compared to net interest and other expense of  in the change was primarily due to interest income generated from the investments of proceeds of our initial public offering in july and a reduction of interest expense from the repayment of our outstanding debt balances during the year using proceeds from our initial public offering 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively  which expire on various dates between and liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations principally though sales of equity securities 
on july  we completed our initial public offering raising net proceeds of million 
we used million of these proceeds to repay substantially all of our outstanding debt 
the remaining funds have been invested in short term interest bearing securities and will be utilized to fund operations and continued growth 
at december   we had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in and million in cash used in operating activities during fiscal years and was attributable primarily to net losses  after adjustments for non cash items  and working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in for  our investing activities consisted principally of the cash component of our purchase of atsi  capital expenditures and purchases and sales of our short term investments 
for  our investing activities consisted principally of capital expenditures and purchases and sales of our short term investments 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in and million in our financing activities consisted principally of proceeds from the sale of our common stock in an initial public offering in  and repayment of debt obligations in we used part of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay existing loans in we expect to have negative cash flow from operations through at least through we expect to incur increasing development expenses  as well as expenses for additional personnel for production and commercialization efforts  and we may never generate positive cash flows 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the availability of other financing 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering and revenue to be derived from product sales and research and development collaborations will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next months 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate  our operations or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products that we might otherwise seek to retain 
the acquisition of jones group was completed february  for purchase consideration of approximately  shares of unregistered argonaut common stock   million cash due at closing  and notes payable aggregating  million payable over two years  plus acquisition related legal  accounting  due diligence and other transaction expenses 
we will utilize the purchase method of accounting for this transaction and we are currently evaluating the allocation of the total purchase price  including amounts to be allocated to goodwill and ipr d 
we expect jones group to provide approximately million to our net sales performance and to be accretive to pre tax operating results 

table of contents the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   adjusted to include the purchase price relating to the acquisition of jones group completed on february   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than to to contractual obligations total year years years cash due at closing of acquisition of jones group notes payable jones group capital lease obligations operating lease obligations minimum royalties total contractual cash obligations factors that may affect our future results we have a history of operating losses and we may never achieve or sustain profitability and may be required to raise additional funds if losses continue 
we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we recorded net losses of million for the twelve month period ended december  we expect to continue to incur operating and net losses for the foreseeable future and we may never generate positive cash flows 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our products 
funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity  the issuance of those securities will result in dilution to our stockholders 
if our products do not become widely used in the life sciences and chemical industries  it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical companies have historically performed chemistry development using traditional laboratory methods 
to date  our products have not been widely adopted by these industries 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon the adoption of these products as a method to develop chemical compounds for the life sciences and other industries 
in order to be successful  our products must meet the performance and pricing requirements for chemistry development within the life sciences and other industries 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective customers that our products are a cost effective alternative to traditional methods and other technologies that may be introduced for chemistry development 
convince prospective customers that our products provide the same or enhanced quality and accuracy as compared with traditional methods and other new technologies which may be developed 
manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost 
install and service sufficient quantities of our products 
if we cannot achieve these objectives  our products will not gain market acceptance 
we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
to meet these challenges  we have recently acquired complementary businesses and may choose to acquire others in the future 
we completed our acquisition of atsi in march and jones group in february we have never integrated a business as financially significant as jones group or an international based business 
our failure to successfully integrate 
table of contents this business may materially affect our business going forward 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any future acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  and may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
if we are unable to effectively integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies  our business may suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill or other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could negatively impact our operating results 
our available cash and securities may be used to buy or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 
due to volatile market conditions  the value of long live assets maybe negatively impacted  which may result in future  additional impairment charges 
moreover  if we buy a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that are unknown at the time of acquisition 
our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products 
we continue to devote significant personnel and financial resources to research and development activities to develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing new products  and we may never realize any benefits from such research and development activities  including both our current research collaboration with pfizer and our product development consortium with pfizer and ici  which may not produce commercially viable products 
our ability to increase our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop new and commercially viable products 
the capital spending policies of life sciences and other chemical research companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
we market our products to and receive our revenues principally from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and other chemical research companies  and the capital spending policies of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
these policies are based on a wide variety of factors  including the resources available for purchasing research equipment  the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures 
in particular  the volatility of the public stock market for biotechnology and related companies has at certain times significantly impacted their ability to raise capital  which has directly affected their capital spending budgets 
in addition  continued consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry will likely delay and may potentially reduce capital spending by pharmaceutical companies involved in such consolidations 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by life sciences companies could cause our revenues to decline and harm our profitability 
our products have lengthy sales cycles  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our ability to obtain customers for our products depends in significant part upon the perception that our products can help accelerate efforts in chemical development 
the sale of many of our products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by customers 
accordingly  the sales cycles of many of our products are lengthy and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
our revenues could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  due to this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle 
a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our revenues decline or do not grow as we anticipate  we might not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses 
our failure to achieve our anticipated levels of revenues could significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not always a good indication of our future performance 
in order to be successful  we must recruit  retain and motivate key employees  and failure to do so could seriously harm us 
in order to be successful  we must recruit  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and sales positions 
in particular  our product generation 
table of contents efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel 
attracting and retaining qualified sales representatives is also critical to our future 
experienced management and technical  marketing and support personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
this is particularly the case in silicon valley  where our headquarters and certain key research and development facilities are located 
the loss of key employees could have a significant impact on our operations 
we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on argonaut s strategies and goals  which may be particularly difficult due to morale challenges posed by workforce reductions and general uncertainty 
john t 
supan  our chief financial officer will resign his position at the earlier of march  or the filing of this annual report on form k 
lissa goldenstein  our president and chief executive officer  will serve as acting chief financial officer during the transition until a successor is named 
during the transition  we expect to engage a consultant to provide guidance and advice to ms 
goldenstein and the company regarding our financial operations and integration plans with jones group 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and may result in the departure of existing employees  customers and or research collaborators 
it may take significant time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personal 
our direct world wide sales force and network of distributors may not be sufficient to successfully address the market for our products 
we sell a major portion of our products through our own sales force 
we may not be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force and continue to expand our network of distributors 
our failure to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force could negatively impact sales of our products  thus reducing our revenues and profitability 
in addition  we need to successfully and efficiently integrate jones group sales force otherwise we may not realize expected synergies 
we are exposed to general global economic and market conditions 
our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states  united kingdom and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the life science and chemical industries 
in recent quarters  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending in the united states  europe  and asia 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our business is subject to risks from international operations 
we conduct business globally 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future international business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
with the jones group acquisition  approximately of our net sales are exposed to foreign currency risk 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could impact our foreign exchange exposure 
we will monitor our exposure and may hedge against this and any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers 
due to the current slowdown in the economy  the credit risks relating to our customers have increased 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 
we have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations 
although these losses have not been significant  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions 

table of contents if we lose our exclusive license to proprietary technology incorporated into our products we may be unable to continue selling those products 
we have developed some of our products based on proprietary technology originally developed by third parties 
we currently have exclusive licenses to use such technology in our products that are subject to termination in certain events 
in particular  our license to proprietary technology belonging to symyx  which is incorporated into our endeavor product 
our sales of this product constitute a significant portion of our revenue 
we estimate that sales of this product will constitute approximately to of our revenues for this estimate depends on a variety of factors  including increased demand  and we cannot be certain that this estimate will be accurate 
if licensors terminate our licenses to any such technology  our revenues will decline 
because we outsource our product assembly  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
we outsource most of the assembly of our products to vendors 
our reliance on our outside vendors exposes us to risks including the possibility that one or more of our vendors could terminate their services at any time without notice  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery  due to the difficulties in switching to alternative vendors  and the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternative sources of manufacturing services 
consequently  in the event that components from our suppliers or work performed by our vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason  our ability to produce and deliver our products would decline 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  and we may not have the resources necessary to successfully compete 
we compete with companies world wide that are engaged in the development and production of similar products 
we face competition primarily from the following three sectors companies marketing conventional products based on traditional chemistry methodologies  pharmaceutical companies developing their own instruments  and companies marketing products based upon parallel synthesis and other innovative technologies  such as mettler toledo ag and several smaller instrument and reagent companies many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from organizations serving the life sciences industry that are developing or marketing competing products and technologies 
these organizations may develop products or technologies that are superior to our products or technologies in terms of performance  cost or both 
these organizations may offer price discounts or other concessions as a competitive tactic that we may not be in a position to match 
we may need to develop new applications for our products to remain competitive 
our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances of one or more of our current or future competitors 
in addition  the introduction or announcement of new products by us or by others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products  as customers evaluate these new products 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively against current technology as well as to respond effectively to technological advances 
if we infringe on or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others or we are unable to protect our own intellectual property rights our revenues could be harmed 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could affect our profitability 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from our business 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity 
table of contents or obtain a license 
we may not be able to obtain required licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could harm our ability to compete and result in a decline in our revenues 
our success will depend on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
any patents we own may not afford meaningful protection for our technology and products 
others may challenge our patents and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed  invalidated or rendered unenforceable 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents to us in the united states or foreign countries 
moreover  competitors may develop products similar to ours that are not covered by our patents 
we try to protect our unpatented trade secrets by requiring our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary information and techniques  our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market will be limited 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment could suffer a further decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and ranged in from a per share high of to a low of and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our common stock  and developments regarding our patents or other intellectual property or that of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq stock market s national market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life science companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the nasdaq national market 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active 
if we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market  including the minimum bid price per share requirement  we may be delisted from trading on such market  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc 
table of contents our principal stockholders  directors and executive officers own approximately of our common stock  which may prevent new investors from influencing corporate decisions 
our principal stockholders who currently own over of our common stock and our directors and executive officers who beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock  will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control of us even if beneficial to our other stockholders 
sales of large numbers of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition  these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
all of the shares sold in our initial public offering are now freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act  except for any shares purchased by our affiliates  as defined in rule of the securities act 
the remaining shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities as defined in rule these shares may be sold in the future without registration under the securities act  to the extent permitted by rule or other exemptions under the securities act 
on march   we issued  shares of unregistered common stock in connection with the acquisition of atsi 
on february   we registered  shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 
on february   we issued  shares of unregistered common stock in connection with the acquisition of jones group 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
pursuant to our charter  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote of action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be deemed beneficial by our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we are also subject to certain provisions of delaware law that could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is related principally to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate investments may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates and floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in debt instruments of high

with the jones group acquisition  approximately of our net sales are exposed to foreign currency risk

we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of based on the preliminary unaudited analysis completed to date  we do not believe that the application of these statements will have an adverse material impact on the earnings and financial position of the company 
accounting impairment of disposal of long live assets in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  these new rules on asset impairment supersede fasb and provide a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas removes goodwill from its scope  describes a profitability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows  establishes a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
we will adopt sfas as of january   and we do not expect this pronouncement to materially impact the results of our operations  financial position  or cash flows
