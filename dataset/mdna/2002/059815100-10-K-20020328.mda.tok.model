the decrease in traditional business net sales resulted from a decline in retread material unit volume from of this traditional business decrease  approximately percentage points were due to the lower translated value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales 
however  this negative translation effect was offset by an april price increase in the united states  price increases at foreign subsidiaries  and an increase in equipment sales 
the company continued to see a slowing in north american retread sales which was attributed to low new truck demand  which encourages the movement of new tires into the replacement market  as well as an increase in imported lower priced new tires 
the decline in traditional business sales volume was also due to competitive pressures and industry consolidation 
the decline in traditional business sales was slightly offset by a increase in tds sales over the increase in tds net sales was principally attributable to dealership acquisitions during the year 
the company s seasonal sales pattern  which is tied to trucking activity  was similar to previous years with the third and fourth quarters being the strongest for sales 
both segments were similarly affected 
consolidated gross profit margin for decreased by percentage points from  reflecting higher raw material prices across most geographic areas 
gross profit margin for the traditional business decreased by percentage points from  while the gross profit margin for tds remained even with consolidated operating and other expenses in decreased from  but were down excluding the non recurring charge in traditional business operating and other expenses in decreased from the decrease in operating and other expenses was a result of cost control measures implemented during  along with benefit during from the restructurings in north america and europe implemented during these savings were partially offset by higher marketing program costs and increased expenses in connection with the previously disclosed michelin litigation 
expenses for the michelin litigation in were  on a pre tax basis 
earnings benefited from the company s current and previous year efforts to return operating expenses to a more historic level  along with performance improvements in the tire management outsourcing operation and a lower effective tax rate 
however  higher raw material costs  which exceeded price increases  offset those cost savings 
this resulted in net earnings remaining even with exclusive of non recurring items in that year 
diluted earnings per share for increased to  up from diluted earnings per share of in earnings in benefited by approximately  or 
per diluted share from a lower estimated effective tax rate for the year  primarily resulting from the favorable resolution of tax issues and the lower tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries

traditional business the company s traditional business operations located in the united states and canada  together with tms and qds  are integrated and managed as one unit  which is referred to internally as north america 
net sales in north america were below primarily due to lower retread material unit volume 
the decrease in net sales was less than the shortfall in retread material unit volume due to a price increase in april of in the united states and canada  an increase in equipment sales and a full year of revenue from tms 
the company continued to see softness in north american sales trends due to competitive pressures and industry consolidation 
the slowing in north american sales trends was also attributed to an oversupply of new tires caused by an influx of imported tires and a decline in new medium duty and heavy duty truck demand which causes tires to be diverted to the replacement market 
a increase in average raw material costs from resulted in a percentage point decline in north america s gross profit margin from exclusive of the  of non recurring charges in  north american operating expenses in were lower than due to lower personnel related and professional costs offset by higher marketing program costs  partially offset by a full year of tms expenses

this collection of countries is under one management group and is referred to internally as europe 
in general  europe s operating results were significantly affected by the devaluation of the euro

the spread between the net sales decrease and the retread material unit volume decrease was due to the lower translated value of the euro

in  tds recorded a loss before interest and taxes of  compared to a loss before interest and taxes of  in impact of inflation and changing prices it has generally been the company s practice to adjust its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect changes in production and raw material costs in order to maintain its gross profit margin 
during the year  the company adjusted selling prices in the united states  canada and other foreign locations to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by the increase in oil prices 
the company may adjust prices if raw material costs rise 
replacement of fixed assets requires a greater investment than the original asset cost due to the impact of general price level increases over the useful lives of plant and equipment 
this increased capital investment would result in higher depreciation charges affecting both inventories and cost of products sold 
capital resources and liquidity at the end of  current assets exceeded current liabilities by  cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   increasing by  during the year 
the company invests excess funds over various terms  but only instruments with an original maturity date of over days are classified as investments 
these investments increased by  from the only changes in working capital requirements are for normal business growth 
the company funds its capital expenditures from the cash flow it generates from operations 
during  the company spent  for capital expenditures 
the company believes that spending in recent years is representative of future capital spending needs 
as of december   the company had available uncommitted and committed lines of credit totaling  in the united states for working capital purposes 
also  the company s foreign subsidiaries had approximately  in credit and overdraft facilities available to them 
from time to time during  the company borrowed funds to supplement operational cash flow needs or to settle intercompany transactions 
the company s long term liabilities totaled  at december   which is approximately of the combined total of long term liabilities and shareholders equity  this is a decrease of  from december   primarily as a result of  of long term debt being classified as short term due in december during the year  the company purchased  shares of its outstanding common stock and class a common stock for  at prevailing market prices and paid cash dividends amounting to  the company generally funds its dividends and stock repurchases from the cash flow generated from its operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to mitigate such risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions 
all derivative transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined company policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
analytical techniques and selective derivative instruments are applied to manage and monitor such market exposures 
foreign currency exposure foreign currency exposures arising from cash flow transactions include firm commitments and anticipatory transactions 
translation exposure is also part of the overall foreign exchange risk 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risks exists primarily with the brazilian real  canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen and european union euro 
the company regularly enters into foreign currency contracts primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage the foreign currency risks associated with most of its firm commitment exposures 
the company also employs foreign exchange forward contracts as well as option contracts to manage the foreign currency risks associated with approximately of its anticipated future cash flow transactions within the coming twelve months 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company also limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into offsetting asset or liability positions and by establishing and monitoring limits on unmatched positions 
the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
on that basis  the potential loss in the value of the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have been  in and  in interest rate exposure in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  the company generally maintains a large portion of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a long term basis 
at december  and  the company had outstanding debt of  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt was  and  respectively 
in addition  at december  and  the fair value of securities held for investment was  and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt and its securities held for investment would not be materially affected by a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
therefore  the effects of interest rate changes on the fair value of the company s financial instruments are limited 
commodities exposure due to the nature of its business  the company procures almost all of its synthetic rubber  which is the predominant raw material used in manufacturing tire tread  at quarterly fixed rates using contracts with the company s main suppliers 
generally  the company adjusts its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect significant changes in commodity costs 
during the year  the company adjusted selling prices in the united states  canada and other foreign subsidiaries to soften the impact of higher oil prices on commodity costs 
therefore  the company s exposure is limited to the extent selling price adjustments fail to offset increases in commodity costs 
significant accounting policies bandag s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable bandag s global credit policies are corporately determined and managed through business unit credit and financial management departments to insure compliance with local laws and to effect proper credit and collections at the country level 
a significant percentage of the company s global accounts receivable are obligations of dealers 
the majority of these accounts receivable are extended within north america 
however  bandag competes in the global marketplace and credit is extended outside of the united states 
bandag continuously monitors political  social and economic risks to insure sound credit decisions are made within these foreign markets 
bandag also extends credit in north america to customers in the trucking and transportation industry 
credit is extended to large national and regional customers on a contractual basis through bandag 
smaller regional and local trucking customers are provided credit through tds 
the total amount of credit extended to trucking and transportation customers is approximately one third of bandag s total global accounts receivable 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
general reserves for bad debts are maintained based upon the length of time the receivables are past due and upon historical write off experience by geographic location 
deferred taxes at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of approximately  the balance consists of approximately  of net deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing of income and deductions for tax versus books  and  of net deferred tax liabilities on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which includes a valuation allowance of  deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries is provided for under the assumption that all profits of the foreign subsidiaries will be repatriated to the united states and all foreign taxes paid will be available to offset united states taxes 
in addition  any deferred tax assets from a foreign jurisdiction are reviewed annually to determine the probability of realizing the asset based on a facts and circumstances approach 
if it is determined unlikely that the asset will be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance is established against the asset 
refer to note f of the consolidated financial statements for further details 
litigation certain other litigation arising from the normal course of business  along with the previously disclosed michelin litigation  are pending 
refer to note m of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
marketing programs the company currently maintains two major marketing programs distribution management request dmr program and powerplus 
both programs are designed to increase company market share by enhancing dealer capability and franchise value 
enhanced dealer capabilities and franchise values are achieved primarily through company provided financial assistance towards the acquisition of equipment  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
under the dmr program  the company provides financial assistance to its dealers 
the decision to grant this financial assistance is discretionary and based on business considerations 
in   and  dmr expenses of   and  respectively  were recorded as selling expenses 
in  in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  dmr expenses will be recorded as a reduction of sales 
the powerplus program allows the dealer to earn powerplus credits to fund certain of their equipment or other purchases 
the company establishes the qualifying purchases and the dollar amount for each pound of qualified tread rubber purchases and records dealer credits at the time of sale as a reduction of gross sales 
bandag may change or eliminate the per pound credit  or modify or discontinue the powerplus program  at any time in its sole discretion 
this fund can accumulate until the dealer has earned all or part of the payment for new bandag equipment or other approved purchases 
outsourcing agreement in connection with a contract entered into by tms  the company is incrementally acquiring ownership of one of its customer s tire and wheel assets throughout the term of the agreement 
the company recognizes the revenue associated with the incrementally acquired ownership in accordance with the contractually specified valuation methodology 
the tire and wheel assets are classified as non current assets 
in   and  these non current assets amounted to   and  respectively 
quarterly the company evaluates the recorded value of the tire and wheel assets against the contractually specified valuation methodology and makes adjustments accordingly 
the contractually specified valuation methodology considers the acquisition price  quantity and condition of the tire and wheel assets but is not intended to serve as a determination of fair market value 
the company then completes a similar analysis  utilizing market values instead of acquisition costs  and adjusts the recorded value of the assets to the lower of these two valuations 
upon termination of the agreement  the tire and wheel assets will either be repurchased by the customer or a third party or will remain the property of the company 
there could be a material difference between the market value and the realizable value should the tire and wheel assets not be repurchased by the customer 
however  the company has determined the probability of this to be highly unlikely based upon the facts and conditions surrounding the contract with this customer 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the tms tire and wheel assets and adjusts the balance to fair value 
national account business the company enters into contracts to supply retreaded tires and other tire related services through its network of franchised dealers to large national and regional customers in the north american trucking and transportation industry 
these agreements are commonly referred to as national accounts both within the company and throughout the tire industry 
bandag actively pursues national account business through its fleet sales force in north america 
the company has experienced significant growth in this area of the business over the last three years with national account fleet business accounting for   and  of tread rubber pounds sold in north america  for   and  respectively 
the continued consolidation in the trucking and transportation industry and increasing competition from other retread suppliers has continued to place pressure on the price of finished retread tires 
these pressures on the national account business have precipitated the need for the company to provide various forms of financial assistance to its dealers to continue the supply of retreaded tires and services on these accounts 
the company internally refers to the financial assistance provided to its dealers related to national account fleet business as fleet subsidy 
in   and  fleet subsidy expenses of   and  respectively  were recorded as other expenses 
in  in accordance with eitf  the financial assistance will be recorded as a reduction of sales 
pension plans the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
the company has not made any contributions to any of the united states pension plans since plan year because the fully funded status of the plans would preclude a tax deduction 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of pension income or expense arising from changes in the pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets 
an important element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on assets 
the company has assumed that the long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
over the long term  the assets in the company s pension plans have experienced returns in excess of  therefore the company believes the assumption of future returns is reasonable 
the assets in the united states plans experienced negative returns in should this trend continue  future pension income would likely decline 
each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the selected discount rate for december  was 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized consolidated pre tax pension income of  and  respectively 
the company estimates pre tax pension income to be  in refer to note j of the consolidated financial statements for further details

per share for the year 
the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first six months of and has not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on the earnings and financial position of the company 
the eitf has recently addressed several topics related to the classification and recognition of certain promotional costs 
in april  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
under this issue  the eitf concluded that all consideration paid by a vendor to a reseller should be classified as a reduction of revenue in the vendor s income statement instead of an expense unless certain criteria are met 
the company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the new accounting rule and expects that certain costs will be reclassified as a reduction of sales and as a reduction of selling and general administrative and other expenses 
the amounts the company anticipates will be reclassified for   and  are   and  respectively 
as reclassifications  these changes will not affect the company s financial position or earnings 
the company will adopt the accounting rule in the first quarter of forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition includes forward looking statements

similarly  statements that describe future plans or strategies are also forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated 
factors which could affect actual results include i whether the current weakness in the european and latin american markets continues  improves or worsens in  ii whether developments in the michelin litigation result in expenses for the michelin litigation exceeding or being less than the currently estimated range of  to  on a pre tax basis  iii whether the ultimate resolution of the michelin litigation will result in any significant liability to the company  iv whether the investment returns from the company s pension plans will be sufficient to justify the company s assumption that the long term return on pension plan assets will be  v the extent to which the trend of negative pension plan returns in the last year would continue and  if so  the impact on future pension income  including the impact on the company s estimate of pre tax pension income of  in  vi the degree to which the current difficult competitive conditions in the replacement market continue or improve  vii the extent of the improvement  if any  in the united states and worldwide economies in  viii the loss of one or more significant dealers or fleet customers  and ix the cost of petroleum based raw material and energy 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements
