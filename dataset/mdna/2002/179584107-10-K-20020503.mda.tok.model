item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report on form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including changes in estimates and judgments used in preparing our financial statements set forth under critical accounting policies and estimates and the factors set forth under certain risk factors relating to our business in this section 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation we mark down our inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory markdowns may be required  which could reduce our margins and operating results 
management records these inventory markdowns periodically based on the various assumptions  including customer demand and preferences 
our success is largely dependent upon management s ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand 
any failure to provide appropriate merchandise in quantities that mirror demand could increase future inventory write downs 
additionally  our inventories are valued using the retail method in north america and bijoux  and average cost in the united kingdom and france 
fluctuations in demand for inventory affect the value of our inventory 
asset impairment we invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and remodeling of stores 
we evaluate the recoverability of these assets periodically and record an impairment charge when we believe the cash flow may not be sufficient to recover the assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  we make investments through our international subsidiaries in intangible assets upon the acquisition and opening of many of our store locations in europe 
we evaluate the market value of these assets periodically and record an impairment charge when we believe an asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
goodwill impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our products  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
we measure impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method 
the estimated cash flows are then compared to our goodwill amounts 
if the unamortized balance of the goodwill exceeds the estimated cash flows  the excess of the unamortized balance is written off 
future cash flows may not meet projected amounts  which could result in impairment 
we will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal with the adoption of sfas no 
 we will assess the impact based on a two step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and will reassess any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with our previous acquisitions 
we recorded approximately million of amortization on goodwill during fiscal and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during fiscal had sfas no 
not been adopted 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we are currently assessing  but have not yet determined the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
as of february   we had unamortized goodwill of approximately million 
accounting for leases we finance certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment is located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases is terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases as a charge against our earnings in the year of termination 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
certain risk factors relating to our business the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward looking statements fluctuations in consumer preference and economic conditions affect the demand of our products our retail jewelry and fashion accessories business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences which are dictated in part by fashion and season 
in addition  certain economic conditions affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer  including  among others  business conditions  unemployment levels  interest rates  energy costs  taxation rates and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer preference and economic conditions may differ or change from time to time in each market in which we operate and negatively affect our net sales and profitability 
purchases in advance of merchandise inventory  excessive markdowns  interruptions in distribution and material inventory shrinkage may negatively impact our profitability fluctuations in the demand for retail fashion accessories and apparel especially affect the inventory we own because we usually order our merchandise well in advance of the applicable season and sometimes before fashion trends are identified or evidenced by customer purchases 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory  especially prior to peak selling seasons when we and other retailers generally build up inventory levels 
we must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise with our suppliers well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases 
we review our inventory aging in order to identify slow moving merchandise and use markdowns to clear merchandise 
markdowns may be used if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference or lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently marked price 
such markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent of the markdowns and amount of inventory affected 
distribution functions for all of our north american stores are handled from our distribution center in hoffman estates  illinois 
distribution functions for all of our stores in the united kingdom  france and ireland are handled from our distribution center in birmingham  united kingdom 
any significant interruption in the operation of these distribution centers  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a loss prevention program in order to control inventory shrinkage  including surveillance systems  education of store personnel and monitoring of returns 
however  there can be no assurance that these safeguards will prevent or adequately limit inventory shrinkage 
any material inventory shrinkage would have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
fluctuations in same store net sales may affect the price of our stock our comparable same store net sales results have fluctuated in the past  on a monthly  quarterly and annual basis  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect our same store net sales results  including changes in fashion trends  changes in our merchandise mix  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
our comparable store net sales results for any particular fiscal month  fiscal quarter or fiscal year in the future may decrease 
as a result of these or other factors  our future comparable store net sales results are likely to have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock because investors may look to our same store net sales results to determine how we performed from period to period absent sales attributable to new stores 
store operations and expansion may affect our ability to increase net sales and operate profitably our continued success depends  in part  upon our ability to increase sales at existing store locations  to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis and to maintain good relationships with mall developers and operators 
because we are primarily a mall based retailer  our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to open new stores in desirable locations  including malls 
our ability to open new stores depends on a number of factors  including our ability to locate and obtain favorable store sites primarily in malls  negotiate acceptable lease terms  obtain adequate supplies of merchandise and hire and train qualified employees 
our ability to operate stores on a profitable basis depends on  among other factors  whether we have to take additional merchandise markdowns due to excessive inventory levels compared to sales trends  and whether we can reduce the number of under performing stores which have a higher level of fixed costs in comparison to net sales 
there can be no assurance that our growth will result in enhanced profitability or that we will achieve our targeted growth rates with respect to new store openings 
the failure to execute our international expansion or successfully integrate our international operations may impede our strategy of increasing net sales and adversely affect our operating results our international expansion is an integral part of our strategy to increase our net sales through expansion 
if our international expansion is not successful  our results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
our ability to grow successfully in the continental european market depends in part on determining a sustainable formula to build customer loyalty and gain market share in the especially challenging retail environments of france and germany 
additionally  the integration of our operations in foreign countries presents certain challenges not necessarily presented in the integration of our north american operations  such as integration of information systems 
for example  we currently use the retail method to value our inventory in north america  but use the average cost method for valuing our inventory in our international subsidiaries 
we are in the process of conforming our inventory valuation methods in our international subsidiaries to the retail method  which will require implementing certain procedures and controls  including integration of our information systems 
the failure to expand and integrate our foreign operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and impede our strategy of increasing our net sales through expansion 
a disruption of imports from our foreign suppliers may increase our costs and reduce our supply of merchandise we purchase merchandise from approximately  domestic and international suppliers 
approximately of all merchandise units purchased for our north american stores representing approximately of total cost were purchased domestically and the remaining of all merchandise units of cost were purchased from outside the united states 
approximately of our total merchandise units purchased for our north american stores representing of cost were from china  including hong kong  with the remainder coming from other foreign countries 
any event causing a sudden disruption of imports from china or other foreign countries  including political instability or the imposition of additional import restrictions  would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in us dollars 
we cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our products currently are manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the us and other foreign governments  including the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or quotas  embargoes  and customs restrictions  against merchandise could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we pursue a diversified global sourcing strategy that includes relationships with vendors in countries 
these sourcing operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds and or other trade disruptions 
changes in the anticipated seasonal business pattern could adversely effect our sales and profits and our quarterly results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors our business follows a seasonal pattern  peaking during the christmas  easter and back to school periods 
during fiscal  these periods accounted for approximately of our annual sales 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal fluctuations also affect inventory levels  because we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory in anticipation of these selling periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the time of store openings  the amount of revenue contributed by new stores  the timing and level of mark downs  the timing of store closings  expansions and relocations  competitive factors  and general economic conditions 
the useful life and value of our goodwill will continue to be reevaluated and could result in a write down of our intangible assets in a future period as of february   intangible assets  which include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  totaled approximately of our total assets 
during fiscal  these intangible assets were amortized over years 
at the time of or following each acquisition by us  we evaluate each acquisition and establish an appropriate useful life for all intangible assets identified based on the specific underlying facts and circumstances of each such acquisition 
subsequent to such initial evaluation  we annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  reevaluate such facts and circumstances to determine if the related intangible asset continues to be realizable and if the useful life continues to be appropriate 
as the underlying facts and circumstances subsequent to the date of acquisition can change  there can be no assurance that we will realize the value of such intangible assets 
at february   we did not consider any of the unamortized balance of intangible assets to be impaired 
any future determination  based on reevaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances that a significant impairment has occurred  would require the write off of the impaired portion of unamortized intangible assets  which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our industry is highly competitive the specialty retail business is highly competitive 
we compete with national and local department stores  specialty and discount store chains  independent retail stores and internet and catalog businesses that market similar lines of merchandise 
some competitors have more resources than us 
given the large number of companies in the retail industry  we cannot estimate the number of our competitors 
depth of selection in sizes  colors and styles of merchandise  merchandise procurement and pricing  ability to anticipate fashion trends and consumer preferences  inventory control  reputation  quality of merchandise  store design and location  and customer service are all important factors in competing successfully in the retail industry 
our successful performance in recent years has increased the amount of imitation by other retailers 
such imitation has made and will continue to make the retail environment in which we operate more competitive 
in addition  our competitive position depends upon a number of factors relating to consumer spending  including future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment  business conditions  interest rates  energy costs and taxation 
a decline in consumer spending on fashion accessories and apparel could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
a decline in number of people who go to malls could reduce the number of our customers and reduce our net sales substantially all of our north american stores are located in regional shopping malls 
our sales are derived  in part  from the high volume of traffic in those malls 
we benefit from the ability of the mall s anchor tenants  generally movie theaters  large department stores and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations for pre teens and teenagers 
sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  competition from non mall retailers  other malls where we do not have stores and the closing of anchor tenants in a particular mall 
in addition  a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target customers  pre teens and teenagers  and increased gasoline prices that may curtail customer visits to malls  could result in decreased sales that would have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the recent terrorist attacks have heightened security concerns and could result in lower customer traffic in our stores in response to the terrorist attacks of september   security is being heightened in public areas 
any further threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events  particularly in public areas  could lead to lower customer traffic in regional shopping malls 
in addition  local authorities or mall management could close regional shopping malls in response to any immediate security concern 
for example  on september   a substantial number of our stores were closed early due to closure of the malls in response to the terrorist attacks 
mall closures  lower customer traffic due to security concerns and increased gasoline prices that may curtail customer visits to malls  could result in decreased sales that would have a material adverse affect on the our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel our success and ability to properly manage our growth depends to a significant extent both upon the performance of our current executive and senior management team and our ability to attract  hire  motivate and retain additional qualified management personnel in the future 
our inability to recruit and retain such additional personnel  or our loss of the services of any of our executive officers  could have a material adverse impact on us 
litigation matters incidental to our business could be adversely determined against us the company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to its business 
management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
depending on the actual outcome of pending litigation  charges would be recorded in the future that may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the price of our stock may fluctuate in the future the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors  sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
control by our chairman we have two classes of common stock  common stock and class a common stock 
the holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share  and the holders of our class a common stock are entitled to votes for each share 
as of march   mr 
rowland schaefer  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  owns or has voting power over approximately of our common stock and approximately of our class a common stock and  as a result  controls approximately of our outstanding voting power on a combined basis 
as a result  our chairman may substancially influence shareholder action  including the election of our directors 
this influence of us by our chairman may make us less attractive as a target for a takeover proposal 
it may also make it more difficult to discourage a merger proposal or proxy contest for the removal of incumbent directors 
as a result  this may deprive the holders of our common stock of an opportunity they might otherwise have to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price in connection with a merger or acquisition of us or with or by another company 
our wage expenses may increase as a result of increases in federal minimum wage laws recent changes to federal minimum wage laws have raised the mandatory minimum wage 
various states  including states where we operate our business  have enacted increases that are higher than the federal minimum wage 
statutory increases in federal and state minimum wages above our current wages could require corresponding increases in higher employee wage rates 
increases in wage rates that are not offset by corresponding increases in sales would adversely affect our results of operations 
we caution our investors that the risk factors described above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
further  management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  percentages which certain items reflected in the financial statements bear to our net sales fiscal year ended feb 
 feb 
 jan 
 net sales cost of sales  occupancy and buying expenses gross profit other expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest expense income  net gain on investments income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations the operating results of claire s nippon co  ltd 
nippon are accounted for under the equity method 
as a result  any losses incurred by nippon in excess of our investment and advances are not reflected in our income statement because the operations are not part of our consolidated group 
accordingly the operating results of nippon are not included in the following analysis 
in addition  the assets and liabilities of nippon are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
under the equity method  our original investment in nippon was recorded at cost and had been adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of earnings or losses from nippon since the acquisition date 
as of february  and february   our investment in nippon was carried at zero on our consolidated balance sheet 
our fiscal years end on the saturday closest to january as a result  our fiscal results consisted of weeks  our fiscal results consisted of weeks and our fiscal results consisted of weeks 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the year ended february   which is referred to as fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from same store sales decreases of for the year 
during fiscal  our sales in north america decreased  while our international sales increased on a same store sales basis 
the same store sales decrease in north america was primarily a result of fewer transactions per store  partially offset by an increase in the average retail per transaction 
cost of sales  occupancy and buying expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase of was primarily the result of additional merchandise markdowns required due to excessive inventory levels compared to sales trends in north america 
these markdowns were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal in north america 
these markdowns helped us reduce inventory levels to be in line with planned sales for future periods 
in addition  the decline in same store sales discussed above resulted in the lack of leverage on fixed occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was caused by inflationary cost increases  partially offset by cost savings achieved in store payroll by reducing hours worked to correspond with lower sales patterns 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily caused by lack of leverage on fixed costs 
it has been our objective to close a number of under performing or duplicative acquired afterthoughts stores 
as of february   afterthoughts stores had been closed or leases not renewed and stores had been opened resulting in stores remaining 
we expect to not renew the leases for approximately stores in fiscal during fiscal  we continued to eliminate redundant field operations and review under performing stores 
as a result of our review  we recorded a million non cash charge to write off the assets whose carrying value had been impaired 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increased depreciation from our international divisions  partially offset by lower depreciation in north america 
interest expense  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the net decrease of million was primarily the result of lower interest rates and lower borrowings on our credit facility 
income taxes decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of pre tax income  income taxes increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate from continuing operations was affected by the tax benefits of losses in mr 
rags being included in the loss from discontinued operations 
our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for the year ended january   which is referred to as fiscal this increase primarily resulted from the twelve months of sales of the afterthoughts stores  as compared with the two months included in the prior fiscal year  offset by same store sales decreases of for the year 
during fiscal  sales at our stores in north america decreased while sales at our international stores decreased on a same store sales basis 
the same store sales decrease was primarily a result of fewer transactions per store  offset by an increase in the average unit retail price of merchandise sold 
the same store sales results of the afterthoughts stores were significantly below those of the claire s accessories stores for the two months ended february  due to a number of factors related primarily to the difficult process of integrating afterthoughts operations into claire s 
cost of sales  occupancy and buying expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase of is the result of additional merchandise markdowns  the expense of transitional services provided by venator to claire s during its integration of the afterthoughts stores and lack of leverage on fixed costs 
the markdowns were a result of lower than expected sales and helped us reduce our inventory levels to be in line with planned sales for future periods 
in addition  the increase was caused by the full year impact of the afterthoughts stores who s occupancy cost as a percentage of sales is higher than the claire s stores 
this is primarily due to lower average store sales in the afterthoughts stores as compared to the average claire s store 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from the fiscal level of million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of operating additional stores 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to certain redundant operations related to the integration of the afterthoughts division s operations and the lack of leverage on corporate expenses due to negative same store sales 
we have substantially completed our integration of afterthoughts as it relates to store operations  payroll and human resources  merchandising  planning and distribution  accounting and finance  real estate and construction  mis  marketing  field operations and the communication of best practices among divisions 
sales and sg a were adversely affected as a result of these integration efforts during fiscal during fiscal  we had an objective to close a number of under performing or duplicative acquired afterthoughts stores 
as of february   afterthoughts stores had been closed or leases not renewed and stores had been opened resulting in stores remaining 
this reorganization and our periodic review of asset impairment caused us to record an million million after tax  or 
per diluted share non cash charge to write off included within selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal the assets whose carrying value had been impaired 
we recognized no impairment charges in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the full year amortization of goodwill and depreciation on the afterthoughts stores 
in fiscal  we recognized a gain on investments of million in connection with the sale of certain equity securities 
there were no gains or losses on investments in fiscal income taxes decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rates declined slightly as a result of increased profitable foreign operations which had lower effective tax rates than the united states 
impact of inflation inflation impacts several of our operating costs including  but not limited to cost of goods and supplies  occupancy costs and labor expenses 
we seek to mitigate these effects by passing along inflationary increases in costs through increased sales prices or by increasing sales 
discontinued operation in january  we announced our decision to discontinue the operations of lux corp 
mr 
rags  a wholly owned subsidiary that previously represented our apparel segment 
our disposal plan is to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities of lux corp 
by the end of fiscal  however  the board of directors has authorized the disposal by other means as well 
the operations of mr 
rags have been accounted for as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements 
although our plan allows for the disposition by the end of fiscal  management estimates that the plan will be completed within the first six months of fiscal we have used a six month period of time in estimating its loss during the phase out period 
the assets of lux corp 
consist primarily of inventory  fixed assets and prepaids  while the liabilities include trade payables  accrued expenses and deferred credits 
in connection with the discontinuation of mr 
rags  the company incurred a charge of approximately million before tax  or million after tax  for the loss on disposal of the segment for fiscal major components of the loss include management s estimates of the excess of net assets over proceeds expected from the sale  professional and credit facility fees expected to be incurred in connection with the sale and approximately million of expected operating losses during the phase out period 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates 
we also incurred million before tax  or million after tax  loss from discontinued operations recorded through the measurement date in fiscal included in this loss was a million before tax  or million after tax non cash charge to write off the assets of stores whose carrying value had become impaired 
at february   claire s stores  our parent company  was a guarantor of approximately million of non cancelable operating leases of mr 
rags 
in the event we do not complete the disposition of mr 
rags by july  we will be required to include any additional losses or gains  if applicable  from discontinued operations for the period after july in our financial statements in the period incurred 
additionally  if we do not dispose of mr 
rags by january  we may be required to reclassify our loss from discontinued operations to continuing operations  or we may consider other alternatives  such as liquidating the assets of mr 
rags  which could result in additional charges to our earnings 
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the acquisition of afterthoughts  we entered into a credit facility pursuant to which we financed million of the purchase price for afterthoughts 
the credit facility includes a million revolving line of credit which matures on december   and a million five year term loan  the first installment of which was paid on december   with future installments  thereafter  payable on a quarterly basis through december  the credit facility is prepayable without penalty and bears interest at a margin of basis points over the london interbank borrowing rate 
the margin is adjusted periodically based on our performance as it relates to certain financial covenants 
on february  approximately million was outstanding on this line of credit  while million was outstanding under the term loan 
also  on february   the borrowings under this credit facility were bearing interest at  and we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
we cannot re borrow amounts repaid under the term loan 
as a result  we have no future availability under the term loan 
we can re borrow amounts repaid under the revolving line of credit  subject to the terms of the credit facility 
as of february   we had million of availability under the revolving line of credit 
we also had  of issued letters of credit which are supported by and considered drawn against our line of credit 
in january  we amended the credit facility effective as of february  the amendment modified certain technical and financial covenants in connection with the planned disposition of mr 
rags lux corp in connection with the amendment  we prepaid million towards our regularly scheduled term loan payments due in fiscal we are required to maintain financial ratios under our credit facility 
required financial ratios include fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated leverage ratio and current ratio 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  our ability to make dividend distributions 
if these financial ratios and other restrictive covenants are not maintained  our bank will have the option to require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the most likely result would require us to either renegotiate certain terms of the credit agreement  obtain a waiver from the bank  or obtain a new credit agreement with another bank  which may contain different terms 
we finance certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
as of february   we had future lease payment obligations under these operating leases of approximately million which includes certain leases of mr 
rags which were guaranteed by us 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment is located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases is terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases 
at february   we had  accrued related to future payment obligations on leasehold improvement leases for closed stores 
we are guarantor on approximately million of operating leases of mr 
rags 
we expect our minimum rental commitments under all non cancelable operating leases which include retail locations to be approximately million in fiscal for details concerning our financial commitments under these arrangements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we review the operating performance of our stores on an on going basis to determine which stores  if any  to expand  relocate or close 
we closed stores in fiscal and anticipate closing approximately stores in fiscal our operations have historically provided a positive cash flow which  together with our cash balances  provide adequate liquidity to meet our operational needs and debt obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary sources of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was income from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash items 
our current ratio current assets over current liabilities was for fiscal and for fiscal at the end of fiscal  we decreased our investment in inventories to million  or  from the fiscal balance of million 
during fiscal  inventory turnover increased to times from times for fiscal the decrease in inventories was due to conservative inventory management given economic conditions and projected sales 
in addition  inventories on a per square foot basis decreased 
net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was primarily capital expenditures of million and the purchase of short term investments 
during fiscal  we continued to expand and remodel our store base 
significant capital projects included the opening of new stores and the remodeling of stores 
funds expended for capital improvements in fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million as we continue to invest in expanding and remodeling our store base and technology 
net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily due to our payments on the credit facility of million and dividends paid of million 
we have significant cash balances  a consistent ability to generate cash flow from operations and available funds under our credit facilities 
we believe that we will be able to maintain our present financial condition and liquidity and be able to finance our capital expenditure plans for fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in july  financial accounting standards board  the fasb  issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement no

we are required to adopt the provisions of statement immediately and statement effective february  furthermore  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before statement is adopted in full will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized and tested for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting requirements prior to the adoption of statement statement requires that upon adoption by us of statement  that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition separately from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with statement s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of it assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations as of the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
that standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
as a result  sfas no 
will not be effective for fiscal management has not determined the effect that sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement retains the requirements of sfas no 
to a recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
this statement requires that a long lived asset to be abandoned  exchanged for a similar productive asset  or distributed to owners in a spin off be considered held and used until it is disposed of 
this statement requires that the depreciable life of a long lived asset to be abandoned be revised and that an impairment loss be recognized at the date a long lived asset is exchanged for a similar productive asset or distributed to owners in a spin off if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale is used for all long lived assets  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
that accounting model measures a long lived asset classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and requires depreciation amortization to cease 
discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis  and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur 
this statement retains the basic provisions of accounting principles board opinion for the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
a component of an entity that is classified as held for sale or that has been disposed of is presented as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early application encouraged 
the provisions of this statement generally are to be applied prospectively 
management has not determined the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements
