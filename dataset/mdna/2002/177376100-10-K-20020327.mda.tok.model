except for innovex  the acquired intangible assets included in process technology projects  among other assets  which were related to research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to product returns  multiple element revenue arrangements  customer programs  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income tax contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives and price protection 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings and possibly result in an incremental reduction to revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
the company also records a reduction in revenue for estimated sales returns and stock rotations 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue may be misstated 
revenue is recognized when earned 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations  software revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment of the software product only if no significant company obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable at the outset of the arrangement 
in the case of non cancelable product licensing arrangements under which certain original equipment manufacturers oems have software reproduction rights  initial recognition of revenue also requires delivery and customer acceptance of the product master or first copy 
subsequent recognition of revenues is based upon reported royalties from the oems 
revenue from packaged product sales to distributors and resellers is recorded when related products are shipped 
revenues from enterprise and corporate licensing arrangements are recognized when the related products are shipped and the customer has been electronically provided with the licenses that include the activation keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software pursuant to an agreement or purchase order 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products  post contract customer support pcs  and or other services  the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company sells software and pcs separately and vsoe is determined by the price charged when each element is sold separately 
product returns and sales allowances  including stock rotations  are estimated and provided for at the time of sale 
non recurring engineering fees are recognized ratably as the work is performed 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are performed 
service and pcs revenues from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates and upgrades are based on the price charged or derived value of the undelivered elements and are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
service revenues are included in net revenues on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
the company adopted the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab in october sab does not supersede the software industry specific revenue recognition guidance  but provides current interpretations of revenue recognition requirements 
the adoption of sab did not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company provides for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on customer specific information and historical collection experience 
if market conditions decline  actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in increased bad debt expenses 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expenses 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make estimates of expected future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company does not expect to record any impairment charges as a result of the adoption of this statement 
the fair value of certain of the company s cash equivalents and investments is dependent on the performance of the companies or funds in which the company has invested  as well as the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing the potential impairment for these investments  the company considers these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of its investees 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million of losses resulting from other than temporary declines in fair value of certain of the company s equity investments

services revenue consists primarily of customer support and consulting in the delivery of implementation services and systems integration solutions 
royalty revenue represents the fees recognized in connection with the development agreement 
the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in license revenue resulting from an increase in the number of metaframe licenses sold for windows operating systems  specifically due to market acceptance of the company s metaframe xp family of products introduced in february the company expects that license revenues will continue to represent a large percentage of net revenues 
the increase in net revenues in was also due to an increase in services revenue due primarily to an increase in larger scale corporate and enterprise licensing arrangements that typically require professional services to ensure successful implementation of citrix technologies

the company s cost of revenues exclude amortization of core technology 
the increases in cost of revenues for and was due to the overall increase in packaged product sales and increases in compensation and other costs of providing services revenues 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction of the level of inventory necessary to fulfill customer orders due to increased market acceptance of corporate and enterprise licenses 
as previously mentioned  corporate and enterprise license sales are typically fulfilled with a nominal level of product media and the licenses are delivered electronically 
the cost of fulfilling such sales is less than traditional packaged product sales  thereby reducing costs of revenues as a percentage of revenue 
gross margin 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue from to was primarily due to larger reserves for obsolete inventory recorded in to a lesser extent  this increase was also due to an increase in sales of corporate and enterprise licensing  which have a higher gross margin versus traditional packaged product as a percentage of product revenue 
the company currently anticipates that gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively stable as compared with current levels 
however  gross margin may fluctuate from time to time based on these factors 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues from to was primarily due to obsolescence charges and the impact of higher consulting services revenue  which has a lower gross profit margin than that associated software licenses

reliance upon strategic relationship with microsoft microsoft is the leading provider of desktop operating systems 
the company depends upon the license of key technology from microsoft  including certain source and object code licenses and technical support 
the company also depends upon its strategic alliance agreement with microsoft pursuant to which the company and microsoft have agreed to cooperate to develop advanced operating systems and promote windows application program interfaces 
the company s relationship with microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties  which individually  or in the aggregate  could cause a material adverse effect in the company s business  results of operations and financial condition competition with microsoft 
microsoft windows nt server  terminal server edition and microsoft windows collectively windows server operating systems are  and future product offerings by microsoft may be  competitive with the company s current metaframe products  and any future product offerings by the company 
expiration of microsoft s endorsement of the ica protocol 
microsoft s obligation to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred method to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows clients expired in november microsoft may market or endorse other methods to provide multi user windows access to non windows client devices  including microsoft s remote desktop protocol rdp 
dependence on microsoft for commercialization 
the company s ability to successfully commercialize certain of its metaframe products depends on microsoft s ability to market windows server operating systems products 
the company does not have control over microsoft s distributors and resellers and  to the company s knowledge  microsoft s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 
product release delays 
there may be delays in the release and shipment of future versions of windows server operating systems 
termination of development agreement obligations 
the company s development agreement with microsoft expires in may upon expiration  microsoft may change its windows server operating systems to render them inoperable with the company s metaframe product offerings 
further  upon termination of the development agreement  microsoft may help third parties compete with the company s metaframe products 
finally  future product offerings by microsoft may not provide for interoperability with the company s products 
the lack of interoperability between present or future microsoft products and the company s products could cause a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
termination of the development agreement revenues 
upon the expiration of the company s development agreement with microsoft  the company will no longer recognize any royalty revenue from the development agreement 
there can be no assurances that the company s agreements with microsoft will be extended or renewed by microsoft upon their respective expirations or that  if renewed or extended  such agreements will be on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions the demand for the company s products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels  the spending levels and growth of the company s current and prospective customers and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the impact of slower it spending in the future  if any  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s short and long term investments with various financial institutions are subject to risks inherent with fluctuations in general economic and market conditions 
such fluctuations could cause an adverse effect in the value of such investments and could even result in a total loss of certain of the company s investments 
a total loss of one or more investments could result in an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
new products and technological change the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
these market characteristics will require the company to continually enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end customer requirements 
as is common in the computer software industry  the company may experience delays in the introduction of new products 
moreover  the company may experience delays in market acceptance of any new products or new releases of its current products 
additionally  the company and others may announce new product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
for example  there can be no guarantee that the company s development stage  channel ready portal software product  nfuse elite  will be introduced when anticipated or desired by the company  or that upon introduction  nfuse elite will be accepted by the company s channel and strategic partners  customers or prospective customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
if the company experiences material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to new products or new releases of its current products  such delays and shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes it will incur additional costs and royalties associated with the development  licensing or acquisition of new technologies or enhancements to existing products 
this will increase the company s cost of revenues and operating expenses 
the company cannot currently quantify such increase with respect to transactions that have not occurred 
the company may use a substantial portion of its cash and investments to fund these additional costs 
the company believes that it will continue to rely  in part  on third party licensing arrangements to enhance and differentiate the company s products 
such licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties such as undetected errors in third party software  disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms  such as royalties payable  and infringement actions brought by third party licensees 
in addition  the loss or inability to maintain any of these third party licenses could result in delays in the shipment or release of the company products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies and to fulfill the company s responsibilities under the terms of the development agreement 
if the company is unable to add the necessary staff and resources  future enhancement and additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
charges in the event of impairment in january  the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  the company no longer amortizes goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
however  the company will continue to have amortization related to certain product and core technologies  trademarks  patents and other intangibles  and the company must evaluate its intangible assets  including goodwill  at least annually for impairment 
if the company determines that any of its intangible assets are impaired  the company will be required to take a related charge to earnings 
furthermore  at january   the company had unamortized identified intangibles with estimable useful lives in the amount of million  of which million consists of product and core technology purchased by the company in its acquisition of sequoia 
the company currently intends to commercialize such technology through its new access portal line of products that includes nfuse elite 
if the company s new access portal line of products is not accepted by the company s channel and strategic partners  customers or prospective customers  the company may determine that the value of such purchased technology is impaired and may be required to take a related charge to earnings 
such a charge to earnings could result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
competition the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive 
certain of its competitors and potential competitors  including microsoft and novell  inc  have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than the company 
the announcement of the release and the actual release of products competitive with the company s existing and future product lines  such as windows server operating systems and related enhancements  could cause existing and potential customers of the company to postpone or cancel plans to license the company s products 
this would adversely impact the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  the company s ability to market ica  metaframe and other future product offerings may be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices implementing the company s product offerings  which attach to windows server operating systems 
in addition  alternative products exist for web applications in the internet software market that directly or indirectly compete with the company s current products and anticipated future product offerings 
existing or new products that extend internet software to provide database access or interactive computing including but not limited to  microsoft products can materially impact the company s ability to sell its products in this market 
as markets for the company s products continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries may enter the markets in which the company competes and further intensify competition 
competitors in this market include microsoft  aol time warner  oracle  sun microsystems and other makers of web server application and browser software 
finally  although the company believes that price has historically been a less significant competitive factor than product performance  reliability and functionality  the company believes that price competition may become more significant in the future 
the company may not be able to maintain its historic prices and margins  and any inability to do so could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence upon strategic relationships in addition to its relationship with microsoft  the company has strategic relationships with ibm  compaq  hewlett packard and others 
the company depends upon its strategic partners to successfully incorporate the company s technology into their products and to market and sell such products 
if the company is unable to maintain its current strategic relationships or develop additional strategic relationships  or if any of its key strategic partners are unsuccessful at incorporating the company s technology into their products or marketing or selling such products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on proprietary technology the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
the company s efforts to protect its proprietary technology rights may not be successful 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  trade name  or copyright could have a material adverse effect on the company 
despite the company s precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to obtain and use information regarded as proprietary 
a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from the licensing of its packaged products under shrink wrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic licensing agreements that may be unenforceable under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the company s ability to protect its proprietary rights may be affected by the following differences in international law 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
third party infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
this may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of such third parties 
such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
product concentration the company anticipates that its metaframe product line and related enhancements will constitute the majority of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to generate revenue from its metaframe product will depend upon market acceptance of windows server operating systems and or unix operating systems 
declines in demand for products based on metaframe technology may occur as a result of new competitive product releases  price competition  new products or updates to existing products  lack of success of the company s strategic partners  technological change or other factors 
need to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers the company intends to expand its ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding channel partners and expanding its offering of consulting services 
the company s inability to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles  which could negatively impact the company s revenues 
additionally  as the company attempts to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers  it may need to increase corporate branding activities  which will increase the company s operating expenses  but may not proportionally increase its operating revenues 
need to expand channels of distribution the company intends to leverage its relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute the company s products 
in addition  an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand its ability to reach large enterprise customers by adding channel partners and expanding its offering of consulting services 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce the company s profits 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels and major distributors the company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of its products 
the company does not control its distributors and resellers 
additionally  the company s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from the company and may also represent other lines of products 
further  the company may maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors 
for example  one such distributor accounted for approximately of accounts receivable as of december  in  the same distributor accounted for of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of such distributors deteriorates and such distributors significantly delay or default on their payment obligations  such delays or defaults could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence upon broad based acceptance of ica protocol the company believes that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its ability to make ica protocol a widely accepted standard for supporting windows and unix applications 
if another standard emerges or if the company otherwise fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows or unix applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
microsoft includes as a component of windows server operating systems its remote desktop protocol rdp  which has certain of the capabilities of the company s ica protocol  and may offer customers a competitive solution 
the company believes that its success is dependent on its ability to enhance and differentiate its ica protocol  and foster broad acceptance of the ica protocol based on its performance  scalability  reliability and enhanced features 
in addition  the company s ability to win broad market acceptance of its ica protocol will depend upon the degree of success achieved by its strategic partners in marketing their respective platforms  product pricing and customers assessment of its technical  managerial service and support expertise 
if another standard emerges or if the company fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows and unix applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
potential for undetected errors despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  new products may contain errors after commencement of commercial shipments 
additionally  the company s products depend upon certain third party products  which may contain defects and could reduce the performance of the company s products or render them useless 
since the company s products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in the company s products or the products of third parties upon which the company s products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by the company s customers 
maintenance of growth rate the company s revenue growth rate in may not approach the levels attained in recent years 
the company s growth during recent years is largely attributable to the introduction of metaframe for windows in mid there can be no assurance that the markets in which the company operates  including the application server market and the internet products market  will grow in the manner predicted by independent third parties 
in addition  to the extent revenue growth continues  the company believes that its cost of revenues and certain operating expenses will also increase 
due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses  together with the possibility of slower revenue growth  the company s income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease as a percentage of revenues in in process research and development valuation the company has in the past re evaluated the amounts charged to in process research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing arrangements 
the amount and rate of amortization of such amounts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the effects of any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission or the accounting profession 
any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission  may materially adversely affect future results of operations through increased amortization expense 
moreover  no assurance can be given that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired in process research and development will not deviate from the projections used to initially value in process research and development when acquired 
ongoing operations and financial results for acquired assets and licensed technology  and the company as a whole  are subject to a variety of factors  which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such transactions 
additionally  in  the company completed the acquisition of certain in process software technologies from viewsoft  in which it allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development 
in april  the company acquired sequoia  of which million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development 
the company s efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of integration work and any associated design  development or rework that may be required to support the integration of the technology into the company s anticipated future product offerings 
failure to complete the development of the company s anticipated future product offerings in their entirety  or in a timely manner  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is currently unable to determine the impact of such delays on its business  future results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional charges in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with completing such projects or that the company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further develop these technologies 
role of mergers and acquisitions mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired entity  which may result in unexpected dilution to the company s earnings 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that the company s previous  including the company s acquisition of sequoia  or future acquisitions will be successful and will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the combined company resulting from any such acquisition can continue to support the growth achieved by the companies separately 
the company must also focus on its ability to manage and integrate any such acquisition 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
revenue recognition process the company continually re evaluates its programs  including specific license terms and conditions  to market its current and future products and services 
the company may implement new programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to its current and future product lines 
the company may recognize revenues associated with such enhancements after the initial shipment or licensing of the software product or over the product s life cycle 
the company has implemented a new licensing model associated with the release of metaframe xp in february the company may implement a different licensing model  in certain circumstances  which would result in the recognition of licensing fees over a longer period  which may result in decreasing revenue 
the timing of the implementation of such programs  the timing of the release of such enhancements and other factors may impact the timing of the company s recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with its products  related enhancements and services and could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
dependence on key personnel the company s success will depend  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements with any of its key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time 
the effective management of the company s anticipated growth will depend  in a large part  upon the company s ability to i retain its highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel  and ii to attract and maintain replacements for and additions to such personnel in the future 
competition for such personnel may affect the company s ability to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
product returns and price reductions the company provides certain of its distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product evaluation 
the company also provides certain of its distributors with price protection rights 
to cover these product returns and price protections  the company has established reserves based on its evaluation of historical trends and current circumstances 
these reserves may not be sufficient to cover product returns and price protections in the future  in which case the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
international operations the company s continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
such international operations are subject to certain risks  such as difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  dependence on independent distributors and resellers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic and political conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
volatility of stock price the market price for the company s common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of the common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue or earnings growth  analyst reports or recommendations and other events or factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock  regardless of the company s actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
for example  several class action lawsuits were instituted against the company  its directors  and certain of its officers in following a decline in the company s stock price 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth and higher operating expenses the company has recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations  the number of its employees and the geographic area of its operations 
in addition  the company has completed certain domestic and international acquisitions 
such growth and assimilation of acquired operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
the company believes that it has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions 
however  its systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support its current or future operations 
in addition  the company may not be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for its products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its expanding product line  expand its sales and marketing organizations and expand its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed product 
the company plans to increase its professional staff during as it expands sales  marketing and support and product development efforts  as well as associated administrative systems  to support planned growth and business objectives 
as a result of this planned growth in the size of its staff  the company believes that it may require additional domestic and international facilities during although the company believes that the cost of such additional facilities will not significantly impact its financial position or results of operations  the company anticipates that operating expenses will increase during as a result of its planned growth in staff 
such an increase in operating expenses may reduce its income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the counter parties to the company s derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
discussions of the company s accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which appears in item of this report 
exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of the company s overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  euros  swiss francs  and australian dollars 
to protect against increases in expenses and the volatility of resulting future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  the company has established a hedging program 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
the company s hedging program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  the company had in place foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of these contracts at december  and were million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates the fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts by million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates may also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in levels of local currency prices or sales reported in us dollars 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse impact to its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts 
exposure to interest rates in order to better manage its exposure to interest rate risk  in november the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million converts the floating rate return on the company s non trading investment portfolio  to a fixed rate 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was million 
based upon a hypothetical increase in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of this asset would have decreased by approximately million 
the company also maintains a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in the company s investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s interest rate swap agreements and non trading investment portfolio 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
