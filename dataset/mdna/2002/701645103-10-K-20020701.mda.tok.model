goodwill and other intangible assets fas  new rules for measuring the impairment of brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles and discontinued amortization for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses  and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review intangible assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant certain of our us department store customers the right to return product  which does not sell through to consumers 
upon sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  reducing net income or increasing net loss 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination
