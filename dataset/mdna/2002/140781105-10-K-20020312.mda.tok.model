item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general business conditions carbo ceramics inc manufactures and sells ceramic proppants for use in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing is the most common technique used to stimulate production from hydrocarbon bearing formations 
the process involves pumping fluids into an oil or gas well at very high pressure in order to fracture the rock formation that contains the hydrocarbons 
as the fracture is created  the fluids are blended with granular materials  or proppants  which fill the fracture and prop it open after the pressure pumping ceases 
the proppant filled fracture creates a highly permeable channel that enables the oil or gas to flow more freely from the formation  thereby increasing production from the well 
ceramic proppants are premium products that are sold at higher prices than sand or resin coated sand  the two primary alternative proppants 
the principal advantage of ceramic proppants is that they are stronger than sand based proppants 
the higher strength of ceramic proppants results in higher production rates in deep wells where sand or resin coated sand may be crushed under high closure stress 
consequently  the level of deep drilling activity generally defined as wells deeper than  feet influences the company s business 
ceramic proppants are also more uniform in size and shape than sand based proppants 
this uniformity can result in higher production rates than sand based proppants when used in wells that do not otherwise require ceramics for their higher strength 
as deep drilling  particularly in north america  is typically focused on the production of natural gas  the company s business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppants is based on the present value economics of comparing the higher cost of ceramic proppants to the future value derived from increased production rates  the company s business is influenced by the price of natural gas and oil 
for much of  oil and gas prices were depressed and worldwide drilling activity was weak 
in  the worldwide rig count averaged  a decline of percent from and percent from the company s financial results for were adversely affected by a decrease in its average selling price due to competitive pressures associated with depressed industry conditions and by additional fixed costs incurred in connection with the start up of its new production facility in mcintyre  georgia  which came on line late in the year 
the price of oil and natural gas and drilling activity improved significantly in the recovery was particularly evident in the north american natural gas activity that is a key driver of the company s business 
as a result  sales volume  average selling prices  revenues and profitability all increased versus the previous year 
the increase in profitability was tempered by the impact of high natural gas prices on the company s manufacturing costs and the continued impact of start up operations at the mcintyre  georgia facility early in the year 
the north american natural gas market remained very strong through the first half of in addition  the company began to see significant benefit from the success of its technical marketing program that promotes the economic benefit of using ceramic proppant in shallower wells 
as a result of the strong market conditions in north america  the company s marketing success and the increased capacity available from its mcintyre  georgia production facility  the company established new annual records for sales volume  average selling price  revenues and net income in despite a downturn in north american natural gas drilling activity in the second half of the year 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer upon delivery 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately percent of the balance in accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
as stated in note to the consolidated financial statements  credit losses historically have been insignificant 
therefore  except in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  the company generally does not record a reserve for bad debts 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of our primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgements about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at cost 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
the company is subject to legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
management does not believe the company is party to any legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions related to those proceedings 
net income percent percent change change in thousands net income    the company s net income for was percent higher than the previous year 
results include a non recurring  non cash administrative charge of million million  net of tax resulting from the modification of the expiration date of fully vested stock options of the company s former president in connection with his retirement in excluding this non recurring charge  net income for increased by over a very strong north american natural gas market was the driving force behind a significant increase in net income for the year 
the number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the us reached record levels in mid year before declining significantly during the second half 
despite this decrease in activity  demand for the company s products remained strong resulting in improved manufacturing efficiency from operating manufacturing facilities at or near capacity throughout the year 
the company reported net income for that was higher than the previous year 
a significant increase in oil and gas drilling activity and in oil and natural gas prices began during the second quarter of and continued through the remainder of the year 
the domestic rig count throughout was percent higher than  while the average price of natural gas increased by percent over the previous year 
decreased costs at the new iberia facility due to higher production rates resulting from an increase in screening capacity and the start up of the second line at mcintyre contributed to net income improvement  with increased sg a costs off setting some of these gains 
individual components of net income are discussed below 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands revenues    the company s revenues of million were percent higher than total sales volume increased percent  with domestic volume up percent and export volume down percent compared to the company believes that this increase was due to both strong natural gas drilling activity in north america and the success of its technical marketing program designed to increase the use of ceramic proppants in wells that have traditionally used sand based proppants 
in both the us and canada  the company s sales volume increased by a larger percentage than industry activity as measured by the number of rigs actively drilling for oil or gas 
the export sales decline was attributable to increased competition  particularly in russia  and the company s decision to supply domestic markets in a capacity constrained environment during much of the year 
the average selling price for the year was per pound  an increase of percent over the year contributing to this was a january price increase of approximately percent and a slight shift in the product mix toward higher strength products 
carbo ceramics inc s revenues of million were percent higher than revenues 
total sales volume increased by percent  with domestic volume up percent and export volume up by percent 
the increased domestic volume was driven by a percent increase in the south texas market  while increased export sales were led by improved sales into australia  china  russia and canada 
revenues were also positively impacted by a june price increase on our carboeconoprop r product 
the average selling price for the year was per pound 
while this was unchanged versus the previous year  the average selling price improved in each quarter during due to a change in the product mix and a price increase on carboeconoprop r that went into effect at mid year 
gross profit percent percent change change in thousands gross profit    gross profit the company s cost of goods sold consists of manufacturing costs and packaging and transportation expenses associated with the delivery of the company s products to its customers 
variable manufacturing expenses include raw materials  labor  utilities and repair and maintenance supplies 
fixed manufacturing expenses include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
certain handling costs related to maintaining finished goods inventory and operating the company s remote stocking facilities are charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
those costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross profit increased by percent from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was percent for  compared to percent for the improvement in gross profit was the result of both the significant increase in sales volume and improved pricing 
improved operating efficiency in manufacturing facilities contributed to increased gross profit margins with manufacturing facilities running at percent of capacity in versus percent of capacity in partially offsetting this was the effect of higher natural gas costs in our manufacturing operations and increased freight costs due to lower than desired inventory levels at remote storage locations 
gross profit increased by percent from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was percent for  compared to percent for the increase in gross profit was driven primarily by the significant increase in sales volume 
the major contributor to reduced gross profit margins was the significant increase in the cost of natural gas at all three manufacturing facilities 
natural gas costs represent approximately percent of the company s total manufacturing costs in compared to percent in the negative effects of the gas price increases were mitigated somewhat by increased production rates at the new iberia and mcintyre facilities which resulted in lower costs per pound 
at the mcintyre facility  throughput rates have improved due to increased familiarity with new equipment and processes
