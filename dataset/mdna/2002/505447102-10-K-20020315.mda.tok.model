overview organized in in connection with the reorganization of labranche co 
from partnership to corporate form and the related initial public offering of our common stock  labranche co inc is the sole member of labranche co 
llc and the sole stockholder of lfsi 
our subsidiary labranche co 
llc is one of the oldest and largest specialist firms on the nyse  as well as a specialist on the amex 
lfsi provides clearing  prime brokerage and execution services to both individual and institutional clients  including traders  professional investors and broker dealers  direct access floor brokerage services 
in addition  lfsi provides front end order execution systems  analysis and reporting solutions for the wholesale securities market 
our business has grown considerably during the past five years 
we have accomplished this growth both internally and through acquisitions 
our revenues increased from million in to million in  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
during the same period  we increased the number of our nyse common stock listings from to revenues our revenues consist primarily of net gain earned from principal transactions in securities for which we act as specialist  and commissions revenue earned from specialist and clearance activities 
net gain on principal transactions represents trading gains net of trading losses and sec transaction fees  and are earned by us when we act as principal buying and selling our specialist stocks and options 
these revenues are primarily affected by changes in share volume and fluctuations in price of our specialist stocks and options 
commissions revenue consists primarily of fees we earn when our specialists act as agents to match buyers and sellers for limit orders executed by us on behalf of brokers after a specified period of time  we do not earn commissions when we match market orders 
in addition  commissions revenue includes fees charged to customers for execution and clearance by our clearing subsidiaries  henderson brothers and rpm clearing corporation 
other revenue consists of interest income  fees charged to customers for use of the front end order execution system developed by itti  proprietary trading revenues and earnings or losses from investments in a hedge fund and two joint specialist books 
for the year ended december   net gain on principal transactions represented of our total revenues  commissions revenue represented of our total revenues  and other revenue represented of our total revenues 
the respective percentages for the prior year were  and 
expenses our largest operating expense is employee compensation and related benefits  which primarily consist of salaries and wages and profitability based compensation 
profitability based compensation includes compensation and benefits paid to managing directors  trading professionals and other employees based on our profitability 
prior to our reorganization from partnership to corporate form in august  a large portion of the compensation payments to our managing directors had not been presented as part of operating expenses 
the aggregate amount of these compensation payments generally approximated the interest of lab investing co 
llc  formerly the general partner of labranche co  in the income of labranche co  before managing directors compensation 
generally  these payments of compensation were allocated among our managing directors based on their respective percentage interests in the profits of lab investing co 
llc subsequent to the reorganization transactions  we include payments to managing directors in employee compensation and related benefits expense 
therefore  historical income before managing directors compensation  limited partners interest in earnings of subsidiary and provision for income taxes for and years prior  understates our operating costs when compared to our present corporate structure 
reorganization transactions in august  we reorganized from partnership to corporate form 
prior to the reorganization  we operated as labranche co  a limited partnership and lab investing co 
llc  a limited liability company and the general partner of labranche co 
as part of the reorganization  we redeemed limited partnership interests in labranche co 
and redeemed or purchased all membership interests in lab investing co 
llc in exchange for a combination of cash  indebtedness and common stock of labranche co inc the redemption of the limited partnership interests was accounted for as a step acquisition under the purchase method of accounting

and lab investing co 
llc as of june   lab investing co 
llc was merged with and into labranche co 
and on the same date  labranche co 
converted into a limited liability company and changed its name to labranche co 
llc

 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination  requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used in all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of assets 
the statement provides that intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  for intangible assets existing at june  or effective immediately for intangible assets acquired after june  rather  these assets will be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in addition  intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives  which are no longer limited to years 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  commencing january  we will cease amortization of recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and the amortization expense for these intangible assets will no longer be included in our results of operations 
we do not anticipate incurring any impairment charges upon implementation of sfas no 
however  it is possible that in the future  after periodic testing  we may incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 
in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies all of our principal securities transactions and the related revenues and expenses are recorded on a trade date basis 
customer securities transactions and the related revenues and expenses are recorded on a settlement date basis  which does not differ materially from trade date basis 
securities owned and securities sold  but not yet purchased are reflected at market value and unrealized gains and losses are reflected in net gain on principal transactions 
our balance sheet contains significant intangible assets 
these intangible assets are comprised of our specialist stock lists  trade name and goodwill acquired in connection with our various acquisitions and the limited partner buyout that occurred in connection with our reorganization from partnership to corporate form in august the specialist stock lists and trade name are being amortized on a straight line basis over to years and the goodwill is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
the allocations of purchase price and determinations of useful lives were based upon independent appraisals for all acquisitions through march in addition  the useful lives of the acquired specialist stock lists were determined based upon analysis of historical turnover characteristics of the specialist stocks comprising these lists 
for acquisitions subsequent to march  the allocations of purchase price and determinations of useful lives were based upon management analysis of revenues  consideration paid  common stock listings as well as other relevant data and ratios 
this information was analyzed and compared to the results of the independent appraisals conducted on acquisitions prior to march as discussed under recent accounting pronouncements  with the implementation of sfas no 
we will no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  which includes goodwill and trade name 
application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
is currently expected to result in an increase in results from operations of approximately million 
commencing  we will perform periodic impairment tests on these assets to determine if there is a need to write them down 
we do not anticipate incurring any impairment charges upon implementation of sfas no 
 but it is possible that in the future the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets may be reduced

investing activities used cash of million primarily for the redemption of former limited partners interests upon our reorganization 
cash of million was provided by financing activities  which came from the proceeds of our initial public offering and proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
certain risk factors in light of the economic downturn over the past two years and the terrorist attacks on the united states in september  we believe that the following risk factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
if any of these events actually occurs  our business  financial condition  operating results and or cash flows could be harmed 
our revenues may decrease due to changes affecting the economy  such as increases in interest rates or inflation  or changes affecting the securities markets  such as decreased volume or liquidity 
an adverse change affecting the economy or the securities markets could result in a decline in market volume or liquidity 
this would result in lower revenues from our specialist and other activities 
historically  increases in our revenues have resulted primarily from significant increases in the volume of trading on the nyse and favorable conditions in the securities markets 
more recently  however  the economy has begun to slow and financial markets have become less prosperous in comparison to the past several years 
if this causes a decline in market volume  or if market liquidity becomes compromised  our revenues could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our results may fluctuate significantly 
our revenues may fluctuate significantly based on factors relating to the securities markets 
these factors include o a decrease in trading volume on the nyse and the amex  o volatility in the equity securities markets  and o changes in the value of our securities positions 
many elements of our cost structure do not decline if we experience reductions in our revenues 
as a result  if market conditions cause our revenues to decline  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and we could suffer losses 
long term downturns in the economy or the equity markets in general could cause trading volumes and revenues to declines and cause our operating results to suffer 
sustained declines in price levels of securities could cause us to incur losses 
adverse changes in the economy and the securities markets  such as have occurred in and  could lead to lower price levels of securities 
sustained declines in these price levels may result in o losses from declines in the market value of securities held in our accounts  o the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations  and o increases in claims and litigation 
recent terrorist attacks have contributed to economic instability in the united states  continued terrorist attacks  war or other civil disturbances could lead to further economic instability and depress our stock price 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope  with the attacks in new york city particularly affecting our operations 
these attacks may cause long term instability in the global financial markets 
this instability has resulted in a slowdown in the employment sector as companies assess the impact of the attacks on their operations and on their employment needs 
the united states is also currently conducting military operations in response to the terrorist attacks 
these attacks and the united states military campaign may lead to substantial armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may contribute further to economic instability in the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  our offices are located in close proximity to the terrorist attacks on the world trade center on september  the aftermath of the attacks on the world trade center and the resulting air quality issues in our building required us to close our operations and temporarily relocate our offices 
the nyse also was forced to stop operating for four consecutive trading days  which caused our operations to halt and could have compromised the liquidity of that market during closure 
if additional terrorist attacks occur in close proximity to our offices  or upon our office buildings  the nyse or the amex  we could be forced to relocate for a longer period of time  or permanently 
furthermore  additional terrorist attack in new york city  or on our buildings  the nyse or the amex  or additional armed hostilities within the united states  could cause significant delays or stoppages in our business activities  which would significantly harm our revenues and profits 
our information or communication systems may fail and interrupt our business 
any information or communication systems failure or decrease in information or communications systems performance that causes interruptions in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or operating results 
our systems may fail as a result of o hardware or software failure  or o power or telecommunications failure 
the september  terrorist attacks  particularly the attacks on the world trade center  caused a temporary lapse in our information and communications systems 
it is possible that additional terrorist attacks may occur in the future without warning and that such attacks could compromise or disable our systems 
although we have established a back up disaster recovery center in new jersey  it may not be effective in preventing an interruption of our business 
it is also possible that any future terrorist activities or an act of war in retaliation against the current united states military campaign could harm our operations and or disaster recovery center  which could significantly harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a majority of our specialist related revenues are derived from trading by us as principal 
additionally  a high concentration of our specialist trading revenue is generated from our ten most profitable specialist stocks 
however  on the percentage of our specialist trading revenue generated from our ten most profitable specialist stocks has decreased from to to of principal trading revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are not overly reliant on a particular group of specialist stocks  as the composition of our ten most profitable specialist stocks changes from year to year 
we also operate a proprietary trading desk separately from our nyse and amex specialist operations  which generated 
of our total revenues for the year ended december  and of our total revenues for the year ended december  we may incur trading losses as a result of these trading activities 
these activities involve primarily the purchase  sale or short sale of securities for our own account 
these activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations and rapid changes in the liquidity of markets 
in any period  we may incur trading losses in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks  lack of trading volume in our specialist stocks and the performance of our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any downward price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
in addition  we have trading limits relating to our proprietary trading activities 
although we have adopted risk management policies  we cannot be sure that these policies have been formulated properly to identify or limit our risks 
even if these policies are formulated properly  we cannot be sure that we will successfully implement these policies 
as a result  we may not be able to manage our risks successfully or avoid trading losses
