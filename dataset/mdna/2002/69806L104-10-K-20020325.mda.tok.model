item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary language the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include market valuations of our stock  financial performance and operations of our shopping centers  real estate conditions  execution of shopping center development programs  successful completion of renovations  completion of pending acquisitions  changes in the availability of additional acquisitions  changes in local or national economic conditions  acts of terrorism or war and other risks detailed from time to time in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable for our current circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require our most subjective judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include our estimates of useful lives in calculating depreciation expense on our shopping center properties and the ultimate recoverability  or impairment  of each shopping center asset 
if actual useful lives are different from our estimates this could result in changes to the results of our operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of our shopping center properties could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the properties that may not be reflected in the properties current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
overview we receive income primarily from rental revenue from shopping center properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
primarily as a result of our acquisition program  including the acquisition of western properties trust described below  which included interests in shopping centers  the financial data shows increases in total revenue and total expenses from period to period 
during the year ended december   eight non strategic assets were sold 
the cash proceeds were used toward the purchase of four shopping center assets 
on november   we acquired western properties trust  a california real estate investment trust 
the transaction was a stock for stock exchange whereby western common shares and units were exchanged into newly issued common shares and operating subsidiary units  based upon a fixed exchange ratio of of a share of our common stock per western share or operating subsidiary unit 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock to holders of western common shares 
we are also currently obligated to issue  shares of our common stock upon the exchange of operating subsidiary units held by limited partners of pan pacific kienows  lp  formerly western kienow  lp  and pan pacific pinecreek  lp  formerly western pinecreek  lp  or pay a cash amount  at our discretion 
in connection with this transaction  we assumed  of western s debt obligations 
we expect that the more significant part of our growth in the next year or two will come from additional acquisitions  rent increases from re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of the assets acquired in the western acquisition and the stabilization of other properties acquired during and

recoveries from tenants were of property operating expenses and property taxes for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the recovery percentage from prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in average portfolio occupancy during as a result of the western acquisition 
in addition  the language in the western leases does not provide for as many costs to be recoverable from tenants as the language in the pan pacific leases 
net gain on sale of real estate totaling  resulted from the sale of eight non strategic assets during the year ended december  other income increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted principally from approximately  of interest income on corporate notes receivable related to real estate activities that were acquired as part of the western acquisition

these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the libor component of our borrowing cost under the revolving credit agreement and term credit agreement over the comparable period in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and benefits and other related expenses resulting from the acquisition of western as well as annual compensation increases in the first quarter of as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december

funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in march the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we consider funds from operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper 
our computation of funds from operations may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations used by other equity reits and  therefore  may not be comparable to these other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 

table of contents the following table presents our funds from operations for the years ended december  net income add depreciation and amortization depreciation of unconsolidated partnerships operating subsidiary minority interests provision for loss on impairment less net gain on sale of real estate depreciation of non real estate corporate assets funds from operations weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding assuming dilution cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in operating income due to property acquisitions including western 
this increase was offset by an increase in accrued interest to note receivable  an increase in other assets and an increase in net gain on sale of real estate 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate  a decrease in costs associated with the acquisition of western and a decrease in other assets  offset by an increase in acquisitions of and additions to properties and an increase in notes receivable 
net cash used in financing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from a decrease in line of credit proceeds  an increase in repurchase of common shares and an increase in distributions paid  offset by an increase in issuance of senior notes and issuance of common shares 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in operating income due to property acquisitions and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in acquisitions of and additions to operating properties and a decrease in proceeds from sale of real estate  offset by an increase in other assets and cash expended on the acquisition of western 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease primarily resulted from an increase in line of credit payments and a decrease in notes payable proceeds  offset by an increase in line of credit and term loan proceeds 
liquidity and capital resources our total market capitalization at december   was approximately  based on the market closing price of our common stock at december  of per share assuming the conversion of  operating subsidiary units to common stock and the debt outstanding of approximately  exclusive of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately at december  our board of directors adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to approximately of our total market capitalization 
however  we may from time to time modify our debt policy in light of current economic or market conditions including but not limited to the relative costs of debt and equity capital  market conditions for debt and equity securities and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
accordingly  we may increase or decrease our debt to market capitalization ratio beyond the limit described above 
in connection with our acquisition of western in november  we entered into a new financing arrangement including a  revolving credit agreement and a  term credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement matures in january and the term credit agreement was scheduled to mature in november at december   we had  available under our revolving credit agreement and the term credit agreement had been repaid in full 
at our option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
at our option  amounts borrowed under the term credit agreement bore interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
the weighted average interest rate for short term libor contracts under the revolving credit agreement at december  was 
we will continue to use the revolving credit agreement to take advantage of select acquisition opportunities as well as to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
in april  we issued  of senior notes due april  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and the term credit agreement 
all of our indebtedness is reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we are not a party to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
our indebtedness outstanding at december  includes regularly scheduled principal reductions  balloon payments and scheduled senior note redemptions as follows year amount the payments due in the year include the balance drawn on the revolving credit agreement at december  of  with regard to the payments noted above  it is likely that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this debt either through additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 

table of contents we could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  further  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
we have future obligations relating to leases for real estate and office equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates through rental expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
minimum rentals under noncancellable operating leases in effect at december  were as follows and subsequent we have entered into certain related party transactions with executive officers and affiliates of the company 
we believe that all related party agreements were entered into at arms length 
information on these related party transactions can be found in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we expect to make distributions from net cash provided by operations 
operating cash flows in excess of amounts to be used for distributions will be invested primarily in short term investments such as collateralized securities of the united states government or its agencies  high grade commercial paper and bank deposits or used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit agreement  if any 
the following table provides recent historical distribution information distribution quarter ended date declared record date date paid per share march  february  march  april  june  june  june  july  september  september  september  october  december  december  december  january  march  february  march  april  june  june  june  july  september  september  september  october  december  october  november  november  march  january  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  november  november  december  during the fourth quarter of we distributed a special  two month dividend of a share 
this dividend was in connection with the western acquisition  and was paid to our stockholders of record before the merger transaction was closed to address the two month shift in timing for the payment of our normal quarterly dividend in future periods 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our current working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make the distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisition and development  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and the use of net proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets 
we also expect to use funds available under the revolving credit 
table of contents agreement to finance acquisition and development activities and capital improvements on an interim basis 
inflation substantially all of our leases provide for the recovery of real estate taxes and operating expenses we incur 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures and percentage rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be substantially offset by expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and percentage rent 
the revolving credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and will be sensitive to inflation 
impact of accounting pronouncements issued but not adopted by the company in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on january   and has not determined the impact of adoption on its financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit agreements and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates  although we use our line of credit for short term borrowing purposes  and could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
additionally  we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december  in relation to total assets of  and a market capitalization of  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate libor debt average interest rate principal amounts shown are in thousands 
excludes unamortized premiums on notes payable  net of discounts  of the fair value of notes payable  line of credit and senior notes payable approximates the carrying amount based on the current rates offered for loans with similar risks and maturities 

table of contents the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates
