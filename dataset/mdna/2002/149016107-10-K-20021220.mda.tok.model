item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues are derived from product sales  which include both licenses of the dct and mgts system software and sales of dct and mgts hardware  and from services  which include customer support under software support contracts as well as installation and training 
prices for the dct and mgts systems vary widely depending upon overall system configuration  including the number and type of software protocol modules and the number of physical interfaces required by the customer 
a dct or mgts system sale typically ranges in price from approximately  to over  in addition to the initial system purchase  customers also may upgrade their systems by purchasing additional software protocol modules and hardware 
customers have the option to purchase a third party workstation or pc from the company or provide a workstation or pc to the company for configuration 
product sales are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installation is complete  provided collection is probable 
the company offers product warranties for various lengths of time  depending on the product and country of purchase or operation 
customers may elect to purchase an annual software support contract which includes both ongoing technical support and any new software releases on a when and if available basis during the term of the support contract 
these software releases may include updates for protocols already licensed by the customer 
revenues from software support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is generally one year 
new customers often purchase onsite training  which is charged on a fixed price basis and recognized when the training is complete 
significant accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included below 
revenue recognition sales of the company s product arrangements normally include hardware and software 
certain of the company s sales may also include installation 
the company also offers training and maintenance services 
the company recognizes revenue on system sales upon shipment or when installation is complete  if installation services are purchased  provided collection is probable 
training and maintenance revenues are based on the company s established history of separate sales of training and maintenance 
revenues allocated to training are recognized at the time the training is complete 
revenues allocated to maintenance are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
foreign currency translations certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as their functional currencies because the majority of their revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities are denominated in those local currencies 
in consolidation  assets and liabilities are translated at period end currency exchange rates and revenue and expense items are translated at average currency exchange rates prevailing during the period 
gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
only gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement of income 
foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments the company s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell the company s products in various global markets 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated sales made 
table of contents to foreign subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables 
the company attempts to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables being hedged in terms of currency  amount and maturity 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the cost of options and any gains or losses on forward contracts are included in other income expense 
use of estimates  allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable balance as of september  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
the company then assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establishes a valuation allowance 
to the extent that the company establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the change is included as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues  cost of revenues and expenses for the year ended september  include the results of the continuing operations of ndb from august   the date it was acquired by the company as described in more detail on page above and exclude the results of the discontinued distribution and consulting businesses engaged in by tekelec limited in japan as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the company anticipates that gross profit margin will decrease in future periods due to the inclusion of the higher cost mgts products in the entirety of those periods 

table of contents cost of services revenues increased by approximately from  in fiscal to million in fiscal due to increases in the number of customer support personnel and the associated costs 
gross margin on services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues  consisting primarily of compensation costs  grew more than the associated revenues 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from a significant increase in the number of personnel engaged in research and development 
this increase in research and development personnel reflected both the addition of employees throughout fiscal and the personnel who joined with the acquisition of ndb one month prior to the end of fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from to over the same period 
the company expects the absolute annual level of research and development expenses to increase in future periods as a result of the ndb acquisition 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at million from fiscal to fiscal as the addition of one month of expenses related to ndb sales and marketing expenses was offset by a reduction in the number of non ndb personnel engaged in sales and marketing as well as by a reduction in variable compensation expense 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at of revenues from fiscal to fiscal the company expects the absolute annual level of sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as a result of additional salary and amortization costs to be incurred as a result of the ndb acquisition 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to decreases in performance related bonuses  recruitment costs and legal fees 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to over the same period 
the company expects the absolute annual level of general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as a result of the ndb acquisition 
purchased in process research and development in fiscal million in purchased in process research and development was charged to operating expenses 
this amount represented two ndb research and development projects in process as of august   the date of the acquisition of ndb 
the value of these projects was determined by an independent appraiser using established valuation techniques and was expensed because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed as of the date of acquisition 
interest income interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to lower prevailing rates of return 
other expense other expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to reduced foreign exchange losses  including losses realized on forward contracts entered into which were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and to the absence in fiscal of a million loss incurred in fiscal on a sale of a marketable security 

table of contents income taxes the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease reflects an increase in the percentage of pre tax income derived from international operations by the company s irish subsidiary  which is subject to a lower income tax rate than the us parent company 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to increased shipments of the company s dct product at higher average unit prices 
services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal services revenues increased more slowly than product revenues due to attrition in the maintenance base as older systems were replaced

table of contents other income expense other income expense decreased from income of  in fiscal to an expense of  in fiscal due primarily to foreign exchange losses  including losses realized on forward contracts entered into which were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and to a loss on a sale of a marketable security 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease reflects primarily the impact of the creation of an irish subsidiary for international distribution of the company s products 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from the proceeds of its initial public offering completed on february  the proceeds to the company from the offering  net of underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million 
on august   the company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the network diagnostics business ndb of tekelec 
the total purchase price consisted of a cash payment of million  two convertible subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million maturing on august  and million in transaction costs which have been capitalized and added to the purchase price for accounting purposes 
based on an independent valuation  a fair value of million has been assigned to the notes 
the total purchase price is subject to a net working capital adjustment pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement following the completion of a closing date balance sheet audit 
ndb s principal product is the mgts digital telecommunications test system  which is similar to the company s dct test systems 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  principally from net income in those periods and  in  from an increase in accrued liabilities

factors that may affect future results the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are important factors that may affect future results and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements that may be made by the company from time to time 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  lengthy sales cycle the company has experienced  and anticipates that it will continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and operating results are relatively difficult to forecast for a number of reasons  including i the variable size and timing of individual purchases by customers  ii seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  such as the varying fiscal year ends of customers and the reduction in business during the summer months  particularly in europe  iii the relatively long sales cycles for the company s products  iv the timing of hiring sales and technical personnel  v changes in timing and amount of sales incentive compensation  vi competitive conditions in the company s markets  vii exchange rate fluctuations  viii changes in the mix of products sold  ix the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company  its customers  competitors or suppliers  x costs associated with developing and introducing new products  xi product life cycles  xii changes in the level of operating expenses relative to revenues  xiii software defects and other product quality problems  xiv customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  xv delays in purchasing decisions or customer orders due to customer consolidation  xvi supply interruptions  xvii changes in the regulatory environment and xviii changes in global or regional economic conditions or in the telecommunications industry 
the company s revenues in any period generally have been  and are likely to continue to be  derived from relatively small numbers of sales and service transactions with relatively high average revenues per order 
therefore  the loss of any orders or delays in closing such transactions could have a more significant impact on the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations than on those of companies with relatively high volumes of sales or low revenues per order 
see dependence on limited number of customers below 
the company s products generally are shipped within to days after orders are received and revenues are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installed  provided collection is probable 
as a result  the company generally does not have a significant backlog of orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked  shipped and installed in that quarter 
the company s expectations for future revenues are predicated  to a large extent  on the recruitment and hiring of a significant number of employees  particularly experienced sales and technical personnel 
failure to hire  or delays in hiring  sufficient sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for any period 
due to the relatively fixed nature of most of the company s costs  including personnel and facilities costs  and because operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue  a decline in revenue from even a limited number of transactions  failure to achieve expected revenue in any fiscal quarter or unanticipated variations in the timing of recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may in some future quarter result in losses or have a material adverse effect on the company s 
table of contents business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes  therefore  that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for all of the foregoing factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail generally or with respect to the company s business  the price of the company s common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on limited number of customers the company s customer base is highly concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for substantially all of the company s revenues to date 
in the fiscal year ended september   the company s top five customers represented approximately of total revenues 
the company expects that it will continue to depend upon a relatively limited number of customers for substantially all of its revenues in future periods  although no customer is presently obligated either to purchase a specific amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of the company s significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company acquired ndb on august  and may make further acquisitions of  or significant investments in  companies  products or technologies that it believes are complementary  although no such acquisitions or investments are currently pending 
the ndb acquisition and any such future transactions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in making acquisitions of companies  products and technologies 
such risks include  among others  the difficulties associated with assimilating the personnel and operations of acquired companies  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  the distraction of management and other resources  the integration of personnel and technology of an acquired company  difficulties in evaluating the technology of a potential target  inability to motivate and retain new personnel  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of the integration of new management personnel 
the company has no experience in assimilating acquired companies or product lines into its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the ndb acquisition or any such future acquisitions 
furthermore  future acquisitions by the company could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation or on the market price of the company s common stock 
stock market fluctuations in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including the company s common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of the company s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in the company s operating results  changes in revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earning estimates by market analysts  the announcements of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 

table of contents competitive market for technical and sales personnel the company s success depends in part on its ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel with appropriate levels of managerial and technical capabilities 
the company believes that a significant level of expertise is required to develop and market the company s products and services effectively 
the company has in the past experienced  and expects to continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified technical and sales personnel 
the company believes that the pool of potential applicants with the requisite expertise is very limited 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
the company competes for such personnel with a number of other companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than the company 
such competition has also resulted in demands for increased compensation from qualified applicants  and the company may not be able to compete effectively for such personnel with companies that provide more attractive compensation arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the technical and sales personnel it requires to conduct and expand its operations successfully on a timely basis 
the failure to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel in the future would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk associated with international operations international sales and operations are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer customer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  changes in regulatory requirements or in economic or trade policy  costs related to localizing products for foreign countries  potentially weaker protection for intellectual property in certain foreign countries  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and practices  tariffs and other trade barriers and potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
during the last three fiscal years  a significant portion of the company s sales has been to customers in japan 
if economic conditions in japan remain weak  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in foreign markets on a timely basis could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the company s international sales  including its sales in japan  are denominated in local currencies 
although the company currently engages in hedging transactions with respect to certain receivables resulting from certain inter company sales  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to do so or that its hedging activities will be successful 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
for example  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the revenues  net income  earnings per share and cash flow of the company s operations in affected markets 
similarly  such fluctuations may cause the company to raise prices  which could affect demand for the company s products and services 
in addition  if exchange or price controls or other restrictions are imposed in countries in which the company does business  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
management of growth the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on its management  administrative and operational resources 
to manage expansion effectively  the company needs to continue to develop and improve its operational and financial systems  sales and marketing capabilities and expand  train  retain  manage and motivate its employee base 
some of the company s senior management have not previously managed a business of the company s size  and these individuals have limited experience managing a public company 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that the company s management will be able to successfully exploit future market opportunities or successfully manage the company s relationships with customers and other third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow or  if it does  that the company will effectively manage such growth 
any failure to manage growth would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents dependence on customer outsourcing of test systems the company s success will depend on continued growth in the market for telecommunications test systems and services and the continued commercial acceptance of the company s products as a solution to address the testing requirements of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
while most of the company s present and potential customers have the technical capability and financial resources to produce their own test systems and perform test services internally  to date  many have chosen to outsource a substantial proportion of their test system and service requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue  or that new customers will choose  to outsource any of their test systems and service requirements or that the company s products and services will be widely adopted 
if the market for telecommunications test systems and services  or the demand for outsourcing  declines or fails to grow  or if the company s products and services are not widely adopted as a telecommunications test solution  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
competitive market the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products are competitive  price competition in the markets for the company s products is intense 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect gross margins  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased competition for the company s products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrade sales 
the company s ability to maintain its competitive position will depend upon  among other factors  its success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product research and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
dependence on rapidly evolving telecommunications industry the company s future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry 
the global telecommunications industry is evolving rapidly  and it is difficult to predict its potential growth rate or future trends in technology development 
there can be no assurance that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to the company or its business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced telecommunications equipment will continue at its current rate or at all 
the company s future success is dependent upon the increased utilization of its test solutions by network operators and telecommunications equipment manufacturers 
industry wide network equipment and infrastructure development driving the demand for the company s products and services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors  including cost  regulatory obstacles or the lack of or reduction in consumer demand for advanced telecommunications products and services 
there can be no assurance that telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators will develop new technology or enhance current technology or  if developed  that such new technology or enhancements will create demand for the company s products or services 
dependence on key personnel the company s future growth and success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing services of its executive officers and other key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements or non competition agreements with any of its employees 
competition for qualified management and other high level telecommunications industry personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the 
table of contents company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel

rapid technological change  uncertainty of acceptance of the company s products and services the market for telecommunications test systems and services is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  rapid changes in customer requirements and frequent product and service introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to these changes by enhancing its existing products and services and by developing and introducing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
in addition  because of the rapid technological change characteristic of the telecommunications industry  the company may be required to support legacy systems used by its customers  which may place additional demands on the company s personnel and other resources and may require the company to maintain an inventory of otherwise obsolete components 
the company s test systems currently operate only on the unix operating system 
the company s current and prospective customers may require other operating systems  such as windows or windows xp  to be used in their telecommunications test systems or may require the integration of other industry standards 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully adapt its products to such operating systems on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
the failure of the company to respond to rapidly changing technologies and to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success will depend in part on whether a large number of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators purchase the company s products and services 
because the telecommunications market is rapidly evolving  it is difficult to predict the future success of products and services in this market 
the customers in this market use products from a number of competing suppliers for various testing purposes  and there has not been broad adoption of the products of one company 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future products or services will achieve widespread acceptance among telecommunications equipment manufacturers  network operators or other potential customers or that solutions developed by competitors will not render the company s products obsolete or uncompetitive 
in the event the telecommunications industry does not broadly adopt the company s products or services or does so less rapidly than expected by the company  or in the event the company s products are rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by more advanced solutions  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on sole and single source suppliers the company purchases many key components  including certain microprocessors  workstations  bus interface and other chips  connectors and other hardware  from the sole supplier of a particular component 
for other components  even though multiple vendors may exist  the company may purchase components from only a single source 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements with these vendors to ensure uninterrupted supply of these components 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in the supply of a key component  a significant amount of time could be required to qualify alternative suppliers and receive an adequate flow of replacement components 
reconfiguration of the company s products to adapt to new components may also be required and could entail substantial time and expense 
in addition  the process of manufacturing certain of these components is extremely complex  and the company s reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes the company to potential production difficulties and quality variations  which could negatively affect cost and timely delivery of the company s products 
the company has from time to 
table of contents time in the past experienced supply problems as a result of the financial or operational difficulties of its suppliers  shortages and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence 
although the company  to date  has not experienced material delays in product deliveries to its customers resulting from such supply problems  there can be no assurance that supply problems will not recur or  if such problems do recur  that satisfactory solutions would be found 
any prolonged inability to obtain adequate amounts of fully functional components or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s relationship with its customers as well as on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party manufacturers the company relies on a limited number of independent manufacturers  some of which are small  privately held companies  to provide certain assembly services to the company s specifications 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements with any third party manufacturer 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in assembly services to the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to establish sufficient assembly services supply from alternative sources 
there can be no assurance that alternative manufacturing sources will be able to meet the company s future requirements or that existing or alternative sources will continue to be available to the company at favorable prices 
risk of product defects products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in future releases of the company s software or that any such errors will not generate adverse publicity  impair the market acceptance of these products  create customer concerns or adversely affect operating results due to product returns  the costs of generating corrective releases or otherwise 
product liability the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions  particularly since the company sells a majority of its products internationally 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims  and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not maintain product liability insurance 
there can be no assurance that the failure to maintain product liability insurance  in the event of the successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product concentration to date  substantially all of the company s revenues have been attributable to sales of the dct family of products and related services 
with the recent acquisition of ndb  the company has expanded its product line to include the similar mgts products  and currently expects the dct and mgts families of products and related services to account for substantially all of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for dct and mgts products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future financial performance will depend  in significant part  on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the dct and mgts families of products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in developing and marketing the dct and mgts families of products and related services

limited protection of proprietary rights  enforcement of rights the company s success and its ability to compete effectively are dependent in part upon its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions  to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
to date  the company has generally not sought patent protection for its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that patent protection will not become a more significant factor in the company s industry in the future 
likewise  there can be no assurance that the measures the company undertakes will be adequate to protect its proprietary technology 
to date  the company has federally registered certain of its trademarks or copyrights 
the company s practice is to affix copyright notices on software  hardware and product literature in order to assert copyright protection for these works 
there can be no assurance that the lack of federal registration of all of the company s trademarks and copyrights would not have a material adverse effect on the company s intellectual property rights in the future 
additionally  the company may be subject to further risks as it enters into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are unavailable  do not provide adequate protection or are difficult to enforce 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such technology or that they will preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features similar to the company s products 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of third party claims of infringement the telecommunications industry is characterized by a relatively high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights 
while to date  the company has not been subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property by third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company  that any such assertion of infringement will not result in litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation 
furthermore  any such claims  with or without merit  could result in substantial cost to the company and diversion of its personnel  require the company to develop new technology or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
because the company does not rely on patents to protect its technology  the company will not be able to offer a license for patented technology in connection with any settlement of patent infringement lawsuits 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against the company and failure or inability of the company to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed  misappropriated or similar technology at a reasonable cost  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company indemnifies its customers against claimed infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights of third parties 
any requirement for the company to indemnify a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents product development risks the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry standards and customer requirements by enhancing its existing products and services and by developing and introducing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
anti takeover effect of nevada law and charter and bylaw provisions  availability of preferred stock for issuance nevada law and the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to those of the common stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock or rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments the company s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell the company s products in various global markets 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency denominated sales made to foreign subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables 
the company attempts to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables being hedged in terms of currency  amount and maturity 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the exposures hedged  these financial instruments do not subject the company to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
realized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts offset foreign exchange transaction gains or losses from revaluation of foreign currency denominated inter company receivable balances which otherwise would be charged to other income expense 
to date  the company has not fully hedged all risk associated with its sales denominated in foreign currencies  and there can be no assurance that the company s hedging activities  if any  will be successful 
at september   the company had forward exchange contracts maturing in fiscal to sell approximately  in japanese yen designed to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the fair market value of these contracts and options at september  was not material 
the company has evaluated the potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term currency fluctuations and believes that any such losses would not be material 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investment portfolio 
as of september   short term investments consisted of available for sale securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note balance sheet components in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these fixed income marketable securities included corporate bonds and government securities  all of which are of high investment grade 
they are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if the market interest rates increase 
if the market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to the company s financial position
