item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the following management s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as the critical accounting policies  of fedex corporation also referred to as fedex 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
fedex is one of the largest transportation companies in the world 
our business strategy is to offer a portfolio of transportation services through our independently operated business units 
these business units are primarily represented by our reportable operating segments fedex express  the world s largest express transportation company  fedex ground  north america s second largest provider of small package ground delivery service  and fedex freight  the largest us provider of regional less than truckload freight services 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks  as measured by our average daily volume  the mix of services purchased by our customers  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by average price per shipment yield  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 
except as otherwise indicated  references to years mean our fiscal year ended may  or ended may of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year 
results of operations consolidated results the following table compares revenues  operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share in millions  except per share amounts for the years ended may percent change revenues operating income net income diluted earnings per share results for include noncash charges of million for impairment of certain assets related to aircraft programs at fedex express and a million reorganization charge at fedex supply chain services 
these charges were million after tax or 
per diluted share 
our results reflect outstanding revenue and earnings growth at fedex ground 
operating income at this segment increased million or  reflecting volume growth in fedex ground s core business and reduced losses in its home delivery service 
the performance of fedex ground  and the addition of fedex freight east formerly known as american freightways in the third quarter of  contributed to improved net income for  but were mitigated by continued softness in package volumes at fedex express 
volume levels in our fedex express domestic and international package services declined in as a result of continued weakness in the us and global economies particularly 
table of contents in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors  which has decreased demand for our higher priced express services 
revenue from our transportation agreement with the us postal service usps  which commenced in the first quarter of  as well as effective cost management  helped soften the impact of reduced package volumes at fedex express 
largely due to the contributions of fedex ground and fedex freight  and the fact that included approximately million in noncash charges discussed below  operating income increased significantly in discretionary spending such as professional fees and travel related expenses was reduced approximately million during pension costs were approximately million higher in  due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets 
variable compensation was slightly higher in during  we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges at fedex express and fedex ground  which more closely link the surcharges to prevailing market prices for jet and diesel fuel  respectively 
lower fuel prices during had a positive impact on operating expenses  however  declines in fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the impact of lower fuel prices on operating income 
conversely  fuel surcharge revenue in more than offset the impact of higher fuel costs 
during  increased fuel prices negatively impacted year over year expenses by approximately million  net of the effects of jet fuel hedging contracts 
we received approximately million in under jet fuel hedging contracts  which we effectively closed during the fourth quarter of by entering into offsetting contracts 
the maturity of these contracts increased fuel costs by approximately million 
net income for reflects the cumulative effect of an accounting change recorded in the first quarter 
this change resulted from adoption of new rules from the financial accounting standards board fasb for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets see note and note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
adoption of these new rules resulted in the first quarter recognition of a million million net of tax or 
per share impairment charge to our recorded goodwill 
results for also reflect the cessation of million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses  as required under the new accounting rules 
goodwill amortization expense was million for and million for our results for reflected strong performance during the first half  which was more than offset by the effects of weakened economic conditions in the second half of the year 
as a result of lower domestic volumes at fedex express in the second half of and lowered capacity growth forecasts  management committed to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity related to our md program which upgrades and modifies our older dc aircraft to make them more compatible with our newer md aircraft 
by curtailing the md program  we eliminated significant future capital expenditures through during  we also took actions to reorganize our fedex supply chain services subsidiary to eliminate certain unprofitable  non strategic logistics business and reduce its overhead 
in addition  due to the bankruptcy of ayres corporation  we wrote off deposits and related items in in connection with the ayres alm aircraft program 
following is a summary of these charges in millions impairment of certain assets related to the md aircraft program strategic realignment of logistics subsidiary ayres program write off total results for were favorably affected by approximately million  related to the charges above  based on actual outcomes as compared to the original estimates 
no material amounts remained on the balance sheet for these items at the end of 
table of contents excluding the effects of business acquisitions in and  revenues increased slightly in  reflecting revenue growth of fedex international priority ip packages 
during  volume growth was higher at fedex ground as this subsidiary continued to grow its core business and expand its new home delivery service offering 
the effects of the acquisition of fedex freight east added approximately million to revenues 
the acquisition resulted in recognition of approximately million in goodwill and was slightly accretive to earnings per diluted share 
for further information regarding this acquisition  see liquidity and note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
our operating results reflected the continuing implementation of the rebranding and reorganization initiatives begun in the last half of to leverage the fedex name and centralize certain sales  marketing and technology functions of fedex express and fedex ground into fedex services see reportable segments below 
these rebranding costs did not have a significant impact on results and were approximately million for and million for our results included a significant reduction in operating costs related to reduced provisions under our variable compensation plans 
pension costs were approximately million lower in  due principally to higher discount rates 
other income and expense and income taxes interest expense was slightly lower in  as we utilized available cash to reduce debt balances during the year see financial condition below 
financing for the acquisition of fedex freight east  which was completed in the third quarter of  was the principal reason net interest expense was higher in in  other nonoperating expenses included losses of approximately million from the retirement of debt assumed in the fedex freight east acquisition and the refinancing of certain capital lease obligations 
other nonoperating expenses in included gains of approximately million from an insurance settlement for a destroyed md aircraft and approximately million from the sale of securities 
our effective tax rate was in  in and in the effective tax rate in was higher than the effective rate primarily due to the utilization of excess foreign tax credits in the rate was favorably impacted by the cessation of goodwill amortization as discussed above and by several other factors  none of which were individually significant 
the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory us federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes 
for  we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
the actual rate  however  will depend on a number of factors  including the amount and source of operating income 
at may   we had a net deferred tax liability of million  consisting of billion of deferred tax assets and billion of deferred tax liabilities 
the reversal of deferred tax assets in future periods is expected to be offset by similar amounts of deferred tax liabilities 
terrorist attacks of september fiscal second quarter operations were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks that occurred on september  all domestic fedex express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on september and  and flight operations resumed on the evening of september  during the period our aircraft were grounded  both domestic and international shipments were impacted  with domestic average daily express volumes declining almost from prior year levels 
we executed contingency plans and transported all domestic shipments during this period through ground based 
table of contents trucking operations 
we resumed air operations within hours of receiving clearance from the federal aviation administration 
business levels at fedex ground and fedex freight were not materially affected 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  the us congress passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act  an emergency economic assistance package to mitigate the dramatic financial losses experienced by the nation s air carriers 
the act provides for billion to be used for financial assistance to airlines to offset losses caused by service disruptions and declines in business activity related to these attacks for the period september  through december the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of september   in september to establish accounting for the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  under eitf  federal assistance provided to air carriers in the form of direct compensation from the us government under the act should be recognized when the related losses are incurred and compensation under the act is probable 
we recognized million of compensation under the act in we have classified all amounts recognized under this program of which million was received as of may  as a reduction of operating expenses under the caption airline stabilization compensation 
while we believe we have complied with all aspects of the act and that it is probable we will ultimately receive the remaining million receivable  compensation previously recognized is subject to audit and interpretation by the department of transportation dot 
we have received requests from the dot for additional information in support of our claims under the act and have responded fully to these requests 
we cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome of such interpretations  but it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the amount of compensation recognized by us under the act could occur 
although increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and further measures may be forthcoming  as of yet we have no estimate of what impact any such measures may have on our results of operations or financial position 
furthermore  we are not certain how the events of september  or any subsequent terrorist activities  will ultimately impact the us and global economies in general  and the air transportation industry in particular  and what effects these events will have on our costs or on the demand for our services 
outlook on may   we announced our first ever payment of a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of 
per share 
we expect to continue these quarterly cash dividend payments  although each subsequent dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
the economic downturn that began in calendar provided opportunities for management teams within the fedex family to examine growth strategies and take steps to right size our transportation networks  improve service and provide choices to fit our customers transportation needs 
we believe we are well positioned for long term growth when the economy  particularly the manufacturing and wholesale sectors  recovers and experiences sustained growth 
for  we anticipate revenue and volume growth in all segments if our expectations of an economic stabilization during the first half of and a recovery during the remainder of the year are realized 

table of contents our diverse portfolio of services is the key factor to our long term growth 
the expansion of fedex ground s home delivery network and continued development and cross selling of the diverse fedex portfolio of services  particularly to small and medium sized businesses  is central to our strategy 
our web site  fedex 
com  is heavily utilized and has helped us reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction 
management believes that our substantially fixed cost infrastructure will allow us to realize incremental profits when the economy recovers 
pension costs are expected to continue to increase over the near term 
our pension cost for will increase by approximately million due to lower interest rates in and the effects of decreased returns on pension plan assets 
for  we will lower our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to 
while employee retirement costs continue to rise  our retirement programs are well funded  with assets sufficient to meet our current obligations 
maintenance costs are expected to be higher in due to scheduled maintenance activities 
higher group health and other insurance costs are also anticipated 
in spite of the impact of these increased expenses  we expect our operating margin to slightly improve as a result of continued focus on cost reductions including hiring restrictions and reduced discretionary spending  productivity improvements and a reduction in the fedex home delivery loss 
actual results for will depend upon a number of factors  including the timing  speed and magnitude of the economic recovery  our ability to match capacity with volume levels and our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives 
in addition  our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before the surcharges are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices 
therefore  our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount 
see forward looking statements for a more complete description of potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future performance 
seasonality of business our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature 
historically  the us package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december 
international business  particularly in the asia to us market  peaks in october and november due to us holiday sales 
our first and third fiscal quarters  because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday seasons  have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods 
the transportation and logistics industry is affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies 
seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage  revenues and earnings 
normally  the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground and fedex custom critical  while the latter part of december  january  june and july of each year are the slowest periods 
for fedex freight  the spring and fall of each year are the busiest shipping periods and the latter part of december  january and february of each year are the slowest periods 
shipment levels  operating costs and earnings for each of our operating companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather 
new accounting pronouncements the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations in june and sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in october these statements will be effective for fedex beginning in we do not expect the application of these new accounting standards to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents reportable segments our reportable operating segments are fedex express  fedex ground and fedex freight  each of which operates in a single line of business 
included within other are the operations of fedex custom critical  fedex trade networks and fedex services 
other also includes certain unallocated corporate items and eliminations 
management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income 
the formation of fedex services at the beginning of represented the implementation of a business strategy that combined the sales  marketing and information technology functions of our fedex express and fedex ground reportable segments to form a shared services company that supports the package businesses of both of these segments 
fedex services provides our customers with a single point of contact for all express and ground services 
prior to the formation of fedex services  each business had its own self contained sales  marketing and information technology functions 
the costs for these activities are now allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided 
these allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions 
the line item intercompany charges on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from fedex services to fedex express and fedex ground  and certain other costs such as corporate management fees

see reportable segments above 
the us overnight box category includes packages exceeding ounces in weight 
the us overnight envelope category includes envelopes weighing ounces or less 
includes a million charge for impairment of the md aircraft program and a million charge for the ayres program write off 
fedex express revenues volumes at fedex express continue to be below levels experienced prior to the economic slowdown  which began in volumes were also significantly impacted by the terrorist attacks on september  all domestic fedex express aircraft were mandatorily grounded on september and  and flight operations resumed on the evening of september  both domestic and international shipments were impacted by this event 
during  total package revenue decreased  principally due to decreases in volumes 
in the united states  package revenue declined on lower average daily domestic express package volume  principally in us overnight box and envelope volumes 
while ip volume decreased slightly in  principally due to a decline in us outbound shipments  ip volumes were positively impacted by the european and asian economies  although volumes in these markets did not grow as much as in for  fedex express experienced ip average daily volume growth rates of and in the european and asian markets  respectively 
package yields are slightly lower in virtually all service categories due to a decrease in average weight per package and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue 
in the second quarter of  we implemented a new index for determining our fuel surcharge 
using this new index  the fuel surcharge ranged between and from november through may the fuel surcharge during all of was 
in  total package revenue increased  principally due to increases in yields and ip volumes 
the increase in yields in was a result of yield management  which included limiting growth of less profitable business and recovering the higher cost of fuel through a fuel surcharge 
domestic rate 
table of contents increases in february also contributed to the higher yield during while the ip volume growth was for  this rate was impacted by a year over year increase in us outbound shipments  offset by weakness in the asian economy in the last half of the year 
for  fedex express experienced ip average daily volume growth rates of in the european market and in the asian market 
total freight revenue for increased significantly due to improved domestic freight volume and yield  reflecting the impact of the usps transportation agreement  which began in august on january   fedex express and the usps entered into two service contracts one for domestic air transportation and the other for placement of fedex drop boxes at us post offices 
on december   we signed an addendum to our transportation agreement with the usps  effective for a month period beginning january   which allows us to carry incremental pounds of mail at higher committed volumes than required under the original agreement 
in  total freight revenue increased slightly over due to significantly improved yields in us freight  partially offset by declines in domestic freight volume and international freight volume and yield 
other revenue which includes canadian domestic revenue  charter services  logistics services  sales of hushkits and other increased in in and  other revenue decreased  mostly due to declines in the sale of hushkits 
hushkits sales were insignificant in fedex express operating income in  operating income at fedex express decreased 
excluding million of asset impairment charges taken in  operating income was down in revenue declines in on a largely fixed cost structure more than offset continued cost management actions 
during  contractual reimbursements received from the usps substantially offset network expansion costs incurred principally in increased salaries 
usps reimbursements during are reflected as a credit to other operating expenses 
this reimbursement  however  had no effect on operating income  as it represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred 
in  fedex express recognized million of operating income from the resolution of certain state tax matters  which is also reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses 
operating income for also reflects the adoption of new rules from the fasb for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in consolidated results above 
for fedex express  adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of million in goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during this amortization amount is comparable to and 
rentals and landing fees were higher in primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental domestic freight volume 
while fuel usage was higher in due to incremental freight pounds transported under the usps agreement  fuel costs were down  as the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel decreased in during  increased fuel expense reflected a increase in average jet fuel price per gallon  which contributed to a negative impact of approximately million  including the results of jet fuel hedging contracts entered into to mitigate some of the increased jet fuel costs 
for  salaries  wages and benefits were higher in spite of reductions in hours and full time equivalents  which were not sufficient to offset base salary increases and higher pension and medical costs 
this is partially because a significant portion of incremental cost increases related to the usps contract is reflected in salaries and wages 
pension costs at fedex express were approximately million higher in profit sharing and incentive compensation provisions were down significantly for 
table of contents in  operating income decreased  reflecting charges related to the impairment of aircraft in the fourth quarter see consolidated results above 
excluding these charges  operating income increased in  despite a slowdown in revenue growth that year  as reduced variable compensation and pension costs  coupled with intensified cost controls over discretionary spending  had a positive impact 
declining contributions from sales of hushkits negatively impacted operating profit by million in fedex express outlook while we believe economic growth during the first half of will be slow  particularly in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors  we expect revenue to increase during  in both the domestic and international markets 
revenue growth is expected to exceed expense growth due to increases in both domestic and international package volumes and yield 
operating margin for this segment is expected to increase in despite increasing pension and health care costs  insurance expenses  maintenance costs and costs associated with annual wage increases 
our expectation of improved performance is based upon continued cost control efforts  with a particular focus on significant improvements in productivity and transportation network efficiency 
we will also benefit in from a full year of operations under our transportation contract with the usps 
although fuel price increases are anticipated during  they are not expected to significantly impact earnings as our fuel surcharge is closely linked to prevailing market prices for jet fuel 
our fuel surcharge has a lag that exists before it is adjusted for changes in jet fuel prices 
therefore  our operating income may be affected should the spot price of jet fuel suddenly change by a significant amount 
fedex ground the following table compares revenues  operating expenses and operating income dollars in millions and selected package statistics in thousands  except yield amounts for the years ended may percent change revenues operating expenses salaries and employee benefits purchased transportation rentals depreciation and amortization fuel maintenance and repairs intercompany charges other total operating expenses operating income average daily packages revenue per package yield operating expense detail for has been omitted  as this data is not comparable 
see reportable segments above 

table of contents fedex ground revenues core business growth and the increasing popularity of our new home delivery service helped fedex ground realize double digit revenue growth in both and  as volumes and yields increased 
sales and marketing activities have been effective in attracting new small and medium sized customers  which generate higher yielding package revenues 
for and  the increase in average daily packages represents positive volume growth experienced in all principal markets served by fedex ground  including fedex home delivery  which added facilities to reach almost coverage of the us population 
in and  year over year yield increases were due primarily to general rate increases  ongoing yield management and a slight increase in the mix of higher yielding packages 
in the third quarter of  we implemented a new dynamic fuel surcharge  which is indexed to the current price of diesel fuel 
using this new index  the fuel surcharge ranged between 
and 
from february through may a fuel surcharge was in effect for most of fedex ground operating income fedex ground s operating income significantly increased in primarily due to package volume growth  higher yields  productivity improvements in both employee and contractor labor and effective cost management 
fedex home delivery had a loss of million in  which is a significant improvement from the loss in facility openings and expansions  as well as increased investments in information systems  resulted in increased depreciation  rental and other property related expenses during salaries  wages and benefits also were higher in due to additional full time equivalents and higher pension and medical costs 
costs for our variable and other incentive compensation plans were significantly higher during  reflecting fedex ground s outstanding financial performance 
during  operating income decreased  primarily due to a fedex home delivery operating loss of million and rebranding and reorganization expenses of million 
the rebranding and reorganization expenses consisted of incremental external costs for rebranding vans  trailers and signage 
such costs were expensed as incurred 
excluding the negative impact of these expenses  operating income decreased from facility openings and expansions  as well as increased investments in information systems  resulted in higher depreciation  rental and other property related expenses during fedex home delivery  launched in march  negatively affected operating income by approximately million 
fedex ground outlook for  volumes and yield are expected to grow in both the core business and fedex home delivery 
fedex ground will continue expansion of the fedex home delivery network to serve nearly of the us population by mid september plans for will be focused on improvements in on time delivery  productivity and safety 
total operating profit for fedex ground is expected to improve over  although we expect operating margin to decrease because fedex ground will absorb a larger portion of allocated sales  marketing  customer support and information technology costs during during  we expect the operating loss from fedex home delivery to improve  with this service becoming profitable sometime in 
table of contents fedex freight the following table shows revenues  operating expenses and operating income in millions and selected statistics for the years ended may revenues operating expenses salaries and employee benefits purchased transportation rentals depreciation and amortization fuel maintenance and repairs intercompany charges other total operating expenses operating income shipments per day weight per shipment lbs revenue per hundredweight results for include the financial results of fedex freight west from december  and of fedex freight east from january  the date of acquisition for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  results are not comparable to statistics for are based on portion of the year including both fedex freight west and fedex freight east january through may 
although revenues were higher in due to the inclusion of a full year of operations  revenues were impacted by lower than expected volumes  due to the economic slowdown  and by a decrease in our fuel surcharge 
the fedex freight fuel surcharge is tied to the retail on highway diesel fuel price  as published by the us department of energy  and changes weekly based on changes in the index 
in  average daily shipments were comparable to the prior year  weight per shipment was down and revenue per hundredweight was up 
during this difficult economic environment  fedex freight improved yields and managed costs 
operating margins were in  reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization and stable pricing  partially offset by the impact of million of rebranding expenses  primarily for tractors and trailers 
our focus on providing superior service to attract and maintain customers solidified our leadership position in the regional less than truckload ltl market 
operating income for fedex freight in reflects the adoption of new rules from the fasb for the treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in consolidated results above 
for fedex freight  adoption of these new rules resulted in the cessation of million of goodwill amortization that would have been recorded in operating expenses during for  goodwill amortization recorded by fedex freight was million  reflecting the acquisition of fedex freight east in january fedex freight outlook we announced in february that fedex freight east formerly known as american freightways and fedex freight west formerly known as viking freight are being rebranded under the name fedex freight 
we believe this will allow us to take advantage of the fedex brand and create additional synergies  which will give us a competitive advantage and continue to improve our market share in the ltl segment 
the rebranding expenses will consist primarily of incremental external costs 
table of contents for rebranding tractors and trailers  which will be expensed as incurred 
the cost of the rebranding is expected to increase fedex freight s operating expenses by approximately million in we expect a total of approximately to million to be spent on rebranding at fedex freight through the complementary geographic regions served by fedex freight east and fedex freight west are expected to have a positive impact on results of operations for this segment 
both companies will continue to focus on day definite regional ltl service  but will also collaborate to serve customers who have multiregional ltl needs 
in june we announced a series of new premium service offerings  including optional money back guaranteed transit times in the west and expanded next day coverage up to miles in selected lanes in the east 
these new service offerings will provide our customers with additional shipping options 
on june   we announced a general rate increase of to be effective july  yield management  enhanced productivity and cost control measures continue to be major focus areas for fedex freight in order to minimize the effects of a soft economy in a highly competitive pricing environment 
other operations other operations include fedex custom critical  a critical shipment carrier  fedex trade networks  whose subsidiaries form a global trade services company  fedex services  a provider of supply chain management services and sales  marketing and it support for fedex express and fedex ground  and certain unallocated corporate items 
also included in this category are the operating results of fedex freight west prior to december  revenues from other operations were million down in compared to billion in and billion in during  a significant portion of the decrease in revenues reflects the fact that current year results for this category no longer include fedex freight west s revenues see fedex freight above 
in both and  revenues at fedex custom critical were down  largely due to the economic downturn 
the demand for services provided by this operating subsidiary critical shipments is highly elastic and tied to key economic indicators  principally in the automotive industry  where volumes have been depressed since calendar operating income from other operations was million in compared to an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in the improvement in over reflects reduced operating costs at fedex supply chain services 
the decrease in operating income in over reflects the effect of the economic slowdown on fedex custom critical during which had strong earnings growth in and lower performance of fedex supply chain services 
operating income in had strong earnings from fedex freight west and also included a million favorable adjustment related to estimated future lease costs from a restructuring at fedex freight west 
on march   a subsidiary of fedex trade networks acquired certain assets of fritz companies  inc  which provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for fedex express in three us locations at a cost of million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large  global corporation 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies  and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
revenue recognition we believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing a company s overall financial performance  and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace 
our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments 
our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational  billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue  bill customers and collect amounts due to us 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or  for our logistics and trade services businesses  upon the completion of services 
in addition  transportation industry practice includes two primary methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred 
we use the second method  we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred 
we believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred 
there are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered  estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit  and estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts 
unbilled revenue 
primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers  there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice 
at the end of a month  unprocessed invoices may be as much as one third of the total month s revenue 
this revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes 
most of these accruals are represented by invoices that are essentially complete  with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued 
the remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment 
these estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced 
because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes  the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced 

table of contents shipments in process 
the majority of our shipments have short cycle times and therefore less than of a total month s revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period 
at month end  we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up  the scheduled day of delivery  the day of the week on which the month ends which affects the percentage of completion and current trends in our average price for the respective services 
we believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period 
future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable 
like many companies  we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable 
historically  our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective 
we also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts  money back service guarantees and billing corrections 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts  adjustments processed  and current collections trends 
allowances for these future adjustments aggregated million at may  and million at may  we consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate  as changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances 
pension cost we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates  which include employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  and future salary increases 
we consider the most critical of these to be our discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the method for determining the value of plan assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied and the rate of future increases in salaries 
for fedex  many of these assumptions are highly sensitive in the determination of a year s pension cost because we have a large workforce that is relatively young and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans 
for example  fewer than of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits 
therefore  the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future 
this long time period increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our pension cost 
total pension costs increased approximately million in and are expected to increase an additional million in discount rate 
this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation 
the discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date february and affects the succeeding year s pension cost 
a decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense 
this assumption is highly sensitive  as a one basis point change in the discount rate affects our pension expense by approximately million 
for example  the basis point decrease in the discount rate to for from for will negatively affect our pension cost by approximately million 

table of contents we determine the discount rate which is meant to be the current rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled with the assistance of actuaries  who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments 
this methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity 
however  the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds 
plan assets 
the estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption that also materially affects our pension cost 
with over billion of plan assets  a one basis point change in this assumption directly affects pension cost by approximately  a decrease in the assumed expected long term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense 
our expected long term rate of return of reflects our active investment management program  which has consistently outperformed the related market indices over the past ten years 
also  because of our relatively young workforce  we are able to maintain more of our pension assets invested in higher returning  longer term equity investments 
while plan investments are subject to short term volatility  they are well diversified and the asset portfolios are closely managed 
we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly 
based on recent trends in asset performance and generally lower risk premiums in equity markets  we lowered the expected long term rate of return for to 
this basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return will negatively affect our pension cost by approximately million 
further adjustments to this estimate may be necessary in the future 
investment losses have also reduced the level of assets to which the expected long term rate of return is applied  which will further increase our pension cost in despite poor asset performance over the past two years that has generated investment losses  our pension plan is and will continue to be appropriately funded to meet the payment of benefits as such obligations become due 
pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date 
we use a calculated value method  which helps mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increases and decreases 
the application of this accounting policy reduced pension cost by approximately million 
salary increases 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost 
we correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments and general estimated levels of profitability incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages 
a one basis point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension costs by approximately  a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost 
thus  the decrease in the assumption to at the end of from will favorably impact pension cost by approximately million 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims  vehicle accident and general business liabilities  and benefits paid under employee health care programs 
at may  we had total self insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet of approximately million million at may  
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
we account for these costs primarily 
table of contents through actuarial methods  which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
these methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals 
however  the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known 
we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis 
nevertheless  changes in health costs  accident frequency and severity  and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
long lived assets property and equipment 
our key businesses are capital intensive 
over of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures 
we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
accordingly  repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives  and the determination of any salvage values  requires management to make judgments about future events 
because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods over years for certain of our aircraft equipment  we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated lives or salvage values are necessary 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
historically  gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material typically less than million annually 
however  such amounts may differ materially in the future based on technological obsolescence  accident frequency  regulatory requirements  and other factors beyond our control 
because we must plan for future volume levels for multiple years in order to make commitments for aircraft based on those projections  we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets  and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations  we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of capacity needs  and those decisions may result in an impairment 
for example  in we made the decision to eliminate certain excess aircraft capacity at fedex express related to our md conversion program 
the decision allowed us to avoid approximately billion in future capital expenditures and resulted in an impairment charge of million to reduce the value of the affected assets to their estimated disposal value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make assumptions about the most likely potential value of assets to be disposed of and the estimated future costs of disposal 
during we substantially completed the disposal of the impaired md program assets  which resulted in a favorable adjustment of million 
leases 
we utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft 
over the years  we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint 
such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor 
as disclosed in contractual cash obligations below and note to the 
table of contents accompanying audited financial statements  at may  we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitments for operating leases 
the future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases 
the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life 
we believe we have well defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation 
goodwill 
we have in excess of billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses 
new accounting standards adopted in require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization 
as previously indicated  the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of million in at one of our smaller businesses 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each of our reporting units to determine their estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
financial condition liquidity we reached a significant milestone in  as we declared our first ever cash dividend 
on may   we announced that shareholders of record as of the close of business on june  will be paid a 
cash dividend per share of common stock 
we expect to continue these quarterly dividend payments  although each subsequent dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at may   compared to million at may  the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended may in millions cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities capital investments and other business acquisitions free cash flow cash used in provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash 
table of contents the following cash based measure is presented as an additional means of evaluating our financial condition because we incur significant noncash charges  including depreciation and amortization  related to the material capital assets utilized in our business 
this measure should not be considered as a superior alternative to net income  operating income  cash from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the following table compares ebitda  as adjusted earnings before goodwill accounting changes  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the years ended may in billions ebitda  as adjusted the increase in cash flows from operating activities in reflects increases in ebitda  as adjusted which includes fedex freight for an entire year and aggressive working capital management 
in  the addition of fedex freight east improved cash provided by operating activities for that year 
cash used for capital investments 
capital expenditures during were lower  primarily at fedex express where capital expenditures were lower due to our efforts at the end of to match our planned spending with anticipated volume levels 
we have taken various actions to reduce future capital expenditures over the past two years  including those related to the curtailment of our md program discussed in consolidated results above and the cancellation of certain contractual obligations to purchase md aircraft from an affiliate of sairgroup 
these actions resulted in the elimination of approximately billion in future capital expenditures 
during  we continued to make investments in fedex ground s infrastructure and information technology and we also made capital investments to expand fedex freight 
see capital resources below for further discussion 
cash used for business acquisitions 
during  a subsidiary of fedex trade networks acquired certain assets of fritz companies  inc that provide essential customs clearance services exclusively for fedex express in three us locations 
during  we acquired fedex freight east for approximately million with a combination of cash and fedex common stock 
during  we acquired three businesses for approximately million  primarily in cash 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of business combinations 
free cash flow 
cash flow from operations during exceeded our cash used for investing activities creating free cash flow of million  with which we paid off over million in debt and repurchased treasury shares 
the achievement of positive free cash flow is attributable to management of capital expenditures and working capital 
positive free cash flow indicates excess funds are available to invest in operations  reduce outstanding debt and provide return on capital to our shareholders 
debt financing activities 
at april   certain existing debt at fedex express matured  principally million of senior notes 
also  in the fourth quarter of  we prepaid the remaining million of debt that was assumed in connection with the purchase of fedex freight east 
in the third quarter of  we issued million of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches three  five and ten years  at million each 
net proceeds from the borrowings were used to repay indebtedness  principally borrowings under our commercial paper program  and for general corporate purposes 
these notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 

table of contents we currently have billion in revolving bank credit facilities that are generally used to finance temporary operating cash requirements and to provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
as of may   we had no commercial paper outstanding and the entire credit facilities were available 
for more information regarding these credit facilities  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
during  we filed a billion shelf registration statement with the sec to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing 
under this shelf registration statement we may issue  in one or more offerings  either unsecured debt securities  common stock  or a combination of such instruments 
cash used for share repurchases 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in  at a cost of approximately million  under our million share repurchase program 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors authorized us to buy back an additional million shares of common stock 
there were no treasury share repurchases during and  during  cash flows were affected by approximately million from the repurchase of million shares 
other liquidity information 
we will remain focused on cost containment and capital expenditure discipline so we may continue to achieve positive free cash flow in the future 
we believe that cash flow from operations  our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
capital resources we have invested aggressively to build our global network and information systems 
in recent years  we invested in the strategic acquisitions that have become fedex ground  fedex freight  fedex custom critical and fedex trade networks 
the sustained need for capital investments and strategic acquisitions throughout those years meant we were not able to generate a positive cash flow after investing activities until with the infrastructure and operating systems now largely in place  we have been able to reduce our capital spending  including equivalent capital as defined below  since despite the decrease in capital spending  our operations remain capital intensive  characterized by significant investments in aircraft  vehicles  computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment  package handling facilities and sort equipment 
the amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors  including preexisting contractual commitments  anticipated volume growth  domestic and international economic conditions  new or enhanced services  geographical expansion of services  competition  availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities 
the following table compares capital expenditures including equivalent capital for the years ended may in millions aircraft and related equipment facilities and sort equipment information and technology investments vehicles and other equipment total capital expenditures equivalent capital  principally aircraft related total see note to the accompanying audited financial statements for a breakdown of capital expenditures by segment 

table of contents in  in spite of capital spending related to the addition of fedex freight east  as well as scheduled deliveries of aircraft that were planned and committed to well before the economic slowdown  management s cost reduction actions resulted in a decrease in capital spending compared to both and for  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion  as we are required to take aircraft committed to in prior years 
because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft  we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance 
therefore  we must make projections regarding our needed airlift capacity many years before aircraft are actually needed 
we will continue to manage our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels  and defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible in order to achieve positive cash flow 
on july   fedex express entered into an agreement with avsa  sarl for the purchase of ten airbus a f aircraft  a new high capacity  long range airplane 
we expect to take delivery of three of the ten aircraft in each of the years  and and the remaining one in the total commitment under the agreement approximates billion 
most of the purchase price of each aircraft is due upon delivery of the aircraft 
the agreement also provides for an option to purchase an additional ten aircraft 
we have historically financed our long term capital investments through the use of lease  debt and equity financing in addition to the use of internally generated cash from operations 
the determination to lease versus buy equipment is a financing decision  and all forms of financing are considered when evaluating the resources committed for capital 
the amount we would have expended to purchase these assets had we not chosen to obtain their use through operating leases leases with terms in excess of of the asset s useful life is considered equivalent capital in the table above and is included in our internal capital budget 
we had no equivalent capital expenditures during or we finance a significant amount of our aircraft needs and certain other equipment needs using operating leases a type of off balance sheet financing 
certain of these operating leases were arranged using special purpose entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry 
at the time that the decision to lease was made  we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values  liquidity and after tax cash flows 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements as well as in contractual cash obligations below 
credit rating agencies routinely use the information concerning our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity 
furthermore  our debt covenants would not be adversely affected by the capitalization of some or all of our operating leases 
in the future  other forms of secured financing may be pursued to finance aircraft acquisitions if we determine that it best suits our needs 
we have been successful in obtaining investment capital  both domestic and international  for long term leases on acceptable terms  although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors 
we believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions  including aircraft  and are adequate for our future capital needs 
for information on our purchase commitments  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements  as well as the table below 

table of contents contractual cash obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
does not include commitments made on july  for purchase of airbus a aircraft 
in addition  we have other commercial commitments incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations  including surety bonds and standby letters of credit 
these instruments are generally required under certain self insurance programs 
while the notional amounts of these instruments are material  there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the liabilities for these self insurance programs are already reflected in our balance sheet as accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
we also have guarantees  amounting to million at may   under certain operating leases for the residual values of aircraft  vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods 
these guarantees are not reflected in our balance sheet since they are not currently considered probable  therefore  they do not represent liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
euro currency conversion since the beginning of the european union s transition to the euro on january   our subsidiaries have been prepared to quote rates to customers  generate billings and accept payments  in both euro and legacy currencies 
the legacy currencies remained legal tender through january  we did not experience a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows from the introduction of the euro and any price transparency brought about by its introduction and the phasing out of the legacy currencies 
costs associated with the euro project were expensed as incurred and were funded entirely by internal cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates  we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates are fixed 
we have outstanding long term debt exclusive of capital leases of billion and billion at may  and  respectively 
market risk for fixed rate  long term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of may  and million as of may  the underlying fair values of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities 
currently  derivative instruments are not used to manage interest rate risk 
while we are a global provider of transportation services  the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by foreign currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world 
the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
foreign currency fluctuations during did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
at may   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ending may  the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in practice  our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations 
therefore  the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel  however  this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges 
in  we implemented new indices for calculating fuel surcharges  which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel 
therefore  a hypothetical change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings 
however  our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet and diesel fuel prices 
therefore our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount 
for  market risk for jet fuel was estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in jet fuel prices applied to projected usage and amounted to approximately million  net of hedging settlements 
as of may   all outstanding jet fuel hedging contracts were effectively closed by entering into offsetting jet fuel hedging contracts 
see notes and to the accompanying audited financial statements for accounting policy and additional information regarding jet fuel hedging contracts 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
