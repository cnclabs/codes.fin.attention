cablevision systems corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing its financial statements  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following restructuring charge in  the company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations in accordance with a plan approved by the board of directors and communicated to potentially affected employees 
the costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs  such as severance pay and outplacement services  and provisions for lease termination costs  including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period  estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances 
costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis  giving effect to the announced severance plan 
costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals 
changes in estimates  as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered  will be reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charge  separately reported and identified 
inter group allocations and transactions the company has included combined financial data for each of the rainbow media group and cablevision ny group in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements 
the combined financial data of rainbow media group and cablevision ny group reflect the application of certain allocation and cash management policies of cablevision 
certain costs of cablevision  including general and administrative costs  such as costs of maintaining corporate headquarters  facilities and common support functions  have been allocated by cablevision to the groups generally based upon specific usage measured by proportionate headcount or square footage or based upon management s estimate of the level of effort expended on each business unit based on historical trends 
these allocation policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cablevision s board of directors may modify or rescind any of these allocation policies without the approval of the stockholders  although no such changes have been made in the reported results or are currently contemplated 
any such changes adopted by the board of directors would be made on the basis of its good faith business judgment of cablevision s best interests  taking into consideration the best interests of all cablevision shareholders 
management believes that these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis 
however  it is not practicable to determine whether the allocated amounts represent amounts that might have been incurred on a stand alone basis  as there are no company specific or comparable industry benchmarks with which to make such estimates 
the company has attributed certain of its assets and operations to either cablevision ny group or rainbow media group 
as previously disclosed  in its discretion  the company may change the attribution of these assets and operations between the groups 
in addition  the cablevision ny group provides services to and receives services from the rainbow media group 
as many of these transactions are conducted between subsidiaries under common control of cablevision  amounts charged for these services have not necessarily been based upon arm s length negotiations and do not necessarily represent the amounts that would be charged by unaffiliated third parties 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets at december  include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired of approximately billion and approximately billion of other intangible assets 
such assets accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
see impact of recently issued accounting standards 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded an impairment loss of million and million representing the balance of goodwill related to certain theaters of clearview cinemas 
in  the company recorded an impairment loss of million representing the balance of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of certain assets associated with the wiz store locations 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets resulted primarily from the company s historical net operating losses 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences between book and tax or net operating loss carry forwards become deductible 
if such estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in and  the company reduced the valuation allowances related to its net deferred tax assets by million and million respectively 
future changes to the valuation allowance will depend on estimates of  and assumptions relating to  the company s future level of taxable income

the restricted group s plant upgrade  combined with additional amounts required for the start up and operation of new businesses such as digital video services  ip telephony  lightpath s non long island based commercial telephone business  and business modem services create a net funding requirement

moody s recently downgraded the company s credit ratings 
standard poors has announced that the outlook for the restricted group s credit ratings is negative and that its ratings of the company could be lowered if leverage were to increase above certain levels 
downgrades by either rating agency would further increase the restricted group s interest rate on new debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional debt

impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
statement also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company adopted the provisions of statement effective july  the adoption of statement had no effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
statement is effective for the company beginning january  at that time  any goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination will not be amortized  but will be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will require  upon adoption of statement  that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
the company will adopt statement effective january  and is evaluating the effect that such adoption may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
as a result of adoption  a substantial amount of the company s intangible assets will no longer be amortized 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both statement and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
statement retains the fundamental provisions in statement for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with statement statement retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike statement  an impairment assessment under statement will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under statement the company is required to adopt statement on january  management does not expect the adoption of statement for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under statement is largely unchanged from statement the provisions of statement generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of statement will have on the company s financial statements

 accounting for the consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendors products

as required  effective january   the company will generally reclassify the amortization of its deferred carriage fees as a reduction to revenues  net 
all comparative periods will be restated 
the amortization of deferred carriage fees shown on the balance sheet is currently included in technical and operating expenses  which would correspondingly be reduced such that operating income and net income would not be affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and certain equity security prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate movements results from its use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund its working capital  capital expenditures  and other operational and investment requirements 
to manage interest rate risk  the company has entered into from time to time interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  the company from time to time may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the at t  adelphia communications  charter communications  and at t wireless common stock held by the company 
as of december   the company had hedged its equity price risk on all of these shares through the execution of prepaid forward contracts 
such contracts set a floor and ceiling on the company s participation in changes in the underlying stock price  thereby eliminating downside exposure and providing for upside appreciation potential to the contract s ceiling price 
fair value of debt based on the level of interest rates prevailing at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock of  million exceeded its carrying cost by approximately million 
the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities 
the company s floating rate borrowings bear interest at current market rates and thus approximate fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at december  would increase the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock instruments by approximately million 
this estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities 
changes in the fair value of these securities are expected to be offset economically by changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative contracts 
interest rate hedge contracts as of december   the company had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of million 
as of december   the fair market value of these interest rate hedge contracts was approximately million and are reflected as derivative contracts in the company s balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of all hedge contracts by approximately million to million 
in addition  the company had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of billion entered into in connection with its monetization transactions 
as of december   such contracts had a fair market value of million  a net liability position reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in the company s balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of these hedge contracts to the company by approximately million to a liability of million 
equity price risk as of december   the fair market value and the carrying value of the company s holdings of at t  adelphia communications  charter communications  and at t wireless common stock aggregated  million 
assuming a change in price  the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately million 
changes in the fair value of these securities are expected to be offset significantly by changes in the fair value of the equity collar used to hedge this market price risk 
as of december   the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of at t  adelphia communications  charter communications and at t wireless aggregated million  a net receivable position 
the maturities of these prepaid forward contracts  all of which were entered into  are summarized in the following table of shares security deliverable maturity at t  adelphia  charter  at t wireless
