item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments on january   micrel announced that it would restate its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and  and the quarters ended march   june   and september  this restatement relates to the company s past method of setting the exercise price of certain employee stock options which results in stock compensation expenses and related payroll and income tax effects that had not been recorded in previously issued financial statements 
it should be noted that micrel sought outside professional advice prior to implementation of the option grant method that resulted in the unintentional consequence of stock compensation charges 
information regarding the effect of the restatement on the company s financial position and results of operations is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k a for the year ended december   the quarterly reports on form q a for the quarters ended march  june and september  and the current report on form k a filed on april  overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance standard analog  high speed mixed signal and digital integrated circuits 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the high bandwidth communications  computer  telecommunications and industrial markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
on may   the company completed the acquisition of kendin  a privately held fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance integrated circuits for the communications and networking markets 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the company issued  shares of common stock and options to purchase  shares of common stock in exchange for all outstanding kendin securities and options to purchase kendin securities 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly all financial statements presented have been restated to include the kendin results 
associated with the acquisition the company recorded million in non recurring acquisition expenses in the quarter ended june  the non recurring expenses consisted of million in transaction costs and million in stock compensation charges 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for   and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures  the successful development of new products  and the company s ability to ramp up manufacturing capacity to meet demand 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic  canadian  and certain other international distributors until such distributors resell the company s products to their customers 
sales to stocking representatives and oem customers are recognized upon shipment 
the company estimates returns and warranty costs and provides an allowance as revenue is recognized 
actual future returns could exceed the returns allowance established 
inventory valuation 
the company has taken adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
income taxes 
as of december   the company has net deferred tax assets of million  resulting from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities 
the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in such intellectual property litigation 
see item  legal proceedings  of this report on form k 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation non recurring acquisition expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in due primarily to lower standard product revenues and lower custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decrease resulted from decreased unit shipments across all significant product lines and end markets except ethernet communications  combined with decreases in average selling prices 
sales of standard products were led by low dropout regulators  ethernet communications products  high bandwidth communications products and computer peripheral products 
such products were sold to manufacturers in the computing  ethernet communications  high bandwidth communications  telecommunications  and industrial markets 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased sales of custom high bandwidth communications products and to a lesser extent decreased foundry sales 
the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because customer end demand can change very quickly and semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
customers continuously adjust their inventories resulting in frequent changes in demand for our products 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the semiconductor industry experienced such a change in the supply and demand situation during and in the fourth quarter of and during  customers in the high speed communications end market  and the contract manufacturing firms that serve this market  adjusted their demand on component suppliers as they coped with high levels of inventory and sharply reduced demand for their end products 
in addition  the slowing of global economic growth during led to lower order rates from customers serving the telecommunications  industrial and computer end markets as they adjusted to lower demand for their products 
the decline in new order rates resulted in a sequential decline in the company s revenues for the first three quarters of the rapid build up of semiconductor inventories in global sales channels caused lead times for components to fall precipitously during the perceived overabundance of semiconductors combined with uncertain demand for their end products led the company s customers to move to a just in time order pattern as they worked to reduce inventories 
due to the combination of excess supply  reduced demand and lower lead times  new orders rates declined and a significant amount of previously placed orders were cancelled during the first half of the corresponding reduction in backlog has left the company  like most semiconductor suppliers  with extremely limited visibility into future customer demand 
customers appear to be placing orders on an as needed basis due to short supplier lead times combined with the uncertain macroeconomic outlook 
the low backlog and uncertainty of customer demand significantly limits our ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
for the year ended december   net revenues increased to million from million in due primarily to higher standard product revenues and  to a lesser extent  higher custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such increases resulted from increased unit shipments combined with an increase in average selling prices 
sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  high bandwidth communications products and computer peripheral products 
such products were sold to manufacturers in the high bandwidth communications  telecommunications  and industrial markets 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such increases were due primarily to increased sales of custom high bandwidth communications products and to a lesser extent increased foundry sales 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar decrease in international sales resulted from decreased unit shipments to manufacturers of personal computers and communications products primarily in europe and to a lessor extent asia 
the company s international sales are denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily reflected decreased capacity utilization  a reduced mix of higher margin standard products and custom products and a decrease in average selling prices compared to the same periods in for the year ended december   the company s gross margin increased to from for the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin reflected higher average selling prices  an increased mix of higher gross margin products and increases in manufacturing efficiency due to greater capacity utilization 
manufacturing yields  which affect gross margin  may from time to time decline because the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
factors such as minute impurities and difficulties in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of new products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses represented and for the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the dollar increases were primarily due to increased engineering staffing costs and increased prototype fabrication costs and new process development costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the years ended december  and  research and development expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the dollar increases were primarily due to increased engineering staffing costs and increased prototype material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar decreases were principally attributable to decreased sales commissions and decreased profit sharing accruals 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increases were principally attributable to increased commissions and staffing costs associated with the growth of the company s revenues  increased legal costs  and increased profit sharing accruals amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company s practices in effect through december related to employee stock option pricing resulted in stock compensation expense under apb for the year ended december  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million of which million was included in cost of revenues  million was included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and million was included in non recurring acquisition costs 
for the year ended december  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million of which million was included in cost of revenues and million was included in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for the year ended december  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million of which million was included in cost of revenues and million was included in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
non recurring acquisition expenses 
non recurring acquisition expenses reflect million in direct transaction costs and million in stock compensation costs related to the acquisition of kendin 
purchased in process technology 
on december   the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of altos for a cash purchase price of million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the total purchase cost was allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount   was allocated to purchased in process technology  which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  for which the company recorded charges in the year ended december  other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
other income  net increased by million to million in from million in this increase were primarily due to the receipt of insurance proceeds of million in  combined with decreased interest expense due to a reduction in the average balances of term notes 
for the year ended december   other income  net increased by million to million from  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in average cash and investment balances combined with increased rate of returns on such balances 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for the year ended december  the benefit for income taxes was million or of loss before taxes 
the benefit for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
for each of the years ended december  and the provision for taxes on income was of income before taxes 
the and income tax provisions differ from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of cash and short term investments of million and bank borrowing arrangements 
borrowing agreements consisted of i million under a revolving line of credit and ii million under a non revolving line of credit 
there were no borrowings under these agreements at december  the two lines of credit are covered by the same loan and security agreement 
the revolving line of credit portion of the agreement expires on june  subject to automatic renewal on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party upon days notice 
the non revolving line of credit portion of the agreement expires on june  borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   or the bank s revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus 
borrowings under the non revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate  the bank s non revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor plus  a fixed rate based on the four year us treasury bill rate at december  plus or an annual adjustable rate based on the one year us treasury bill rate at december  plus 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the non revolving bank line of credit that is covered by the loan agreement described above  can be used to fund purchases of capital equipment whereby the company may borrow up to of the acquisition cost 
amounts borrowed under this credit line are automatically converted to four year installment notes 
all equipment notes are collateralized by the value of manufacturing equipment underlying the specified amounts advanced under the non revolving bank line of credit 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under term notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 
the company s working capital increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  prepaid expenses and other of million and inventories of million combined with decreases in income taxes payable of million  accounts payable of million  deferred income of million and accrued compensation of million  which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreased net income adjusted for non cash activities 
for the year ended december  the company s cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to net income of million after adding back non cash activities and a decrease in accounts receivable of which were partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and other of million and inventories of million combined with decreases in accounts payable of million  deferred income of million and accrued compensation of million 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s investing activities during the year ended december  used cash of million as compared to million of cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  this decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a reduction in purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements combined with an increase in proceeds from the net sale of short term investments 
cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from net purchases of million of equipment and leasehold improvements that were primarily for wafer fab and testing equipment  which was partially offset by net sales of short term investments of million 
the company s financing activities during the year ended december  provided cash of million as compared to cash provided of million during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was the result of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options and purchases through the employee stock purchase plan  which was partially offset by repurchases of common stock of million and million in repayments of long term debt 
the company currently intends to purchase approximately million to million in capital equipment during the next twelve months primarily for the purchase of additional wafer and test manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company s board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to million of common stock during the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facilities 
factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  statements regarding the levels of international sales  statements regarding future expansion or utilization of manufacturing capacity  statements regarding future expenditures  and statements regarding current or future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the additional factors set forth below 
the company is exposed to risks because of the recent slowdown in the global economy 
recently  the global economy has been experiencing a slowdown due to many factors  including decreased consumer confidence and concerns about inflation  and reduced corporate profits and capital spending 
the technology related end markets that the company serves such as the high speed communications  computing and telecommunications markets have been greatly effected by this economic slowdown 
as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions  the company has experienced lower levels of new customer order rates and lower management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue levels 
if these weak economic conditions in the global economy continue or worsen  or if a wider global economic recession materializes  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the its control 
if the company s operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of its common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect the company s quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult for the company to control or predict are the volume and timing of orders received changes in the mix of products sold market acceptance of the company s products and its customers products competitive pricing pressures cyclical semiconductor industry conditions dependence on third party suppliers the ability to introduce new products on a timely basis the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors the timing and extent of research and development expenses fluctuations in manufacturing yields the ability to hire and retain key technical and management personnel access to advanced process technologies the timing and extent of process development costs the current california energy crisis customer demand for the company s products is volatile and difficult to predict the company s customers continuously adjust their inventories in response to changes in end market demand for their products and the availability of semiconductor components 
this results in frequent changes in demand for the company s products 
the volatility of customer demand limits the company s ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because customer end demand can change very quickly 
also  semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
the current weakness in the global economy has caused the end markets that the company s customers serve to grow less rapidly  or in some cases  contract 
the resulting uncertainty of demand has caused most of the company s customers to err on the side of caution until they see signs of order strength for their end products 
in addition  many customers are continuing to deplete excess inventories  particularly contract manufacturers and high bandwidth communication oem s 
semiconductors are perceived to be readily available and supplier lead times are at or near historic lows 
in this environment customers are not making large purchase commitments  only ordering small quantities to fill known short term requirements  greatly reducing our visibility into customer demand 
as a result  the company s revenues are highly dependent upon turns fill orders orders booked and shipped in the same quarter 
the reduced level of order backlog coupled with the short term nature of customer demand makes it extremely difficult to predict near term revenues and profits 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry can result in downturns that can harm the company s operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and periodically subject to significant economic downturns 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of selling prices and over capacity levels as well as rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
management believes that the semiconductor industry is currently in such a downturn and that the decrease in our net revenues from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  is primarily due to this downturn 
the company s net revenues may continue to be adversely affected if this downturn continues 
in general  the company may experience future substantial period to period fluctuations in its business and operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
the company s gross margin is dependent upon a number of factors  including the level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing is a capital intensive business resulting in high fixed costs 
if the company is unable to utilize its installed wafer fabrication or test capacity at a high level  the costs associated with these facilities and equipment is not fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower sales margins 
the decline in new customer order rates in has resulted in reduced capacity utilization of the company s factories as it has attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand 
the company s gross margins have declined as a result of this reduced utilization of production capacity 
gross margins may deteriorate further should production activity be curtailed in response to lower customer demand in the future 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  price erosion and increased international competition 
significant competitive factors include product features performance price timing of product introductions emergence of new computer and communications standards quality and customer support in times of weak economic conditions  such as the semiconductor industry is now experiencing and due to uncertain customer demand and under utilization of semiconductor fabrication capacity  price competition becomes more prevalent 
this can have the effect of reducing revenue levels and gross margins 
because the standard products market for integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company has 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that the company will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that its cost of materials will be higher than expected 
the company faces many risks associated with its dependence upon third parties that manufacture  assemble or package certain of our products 
these risks include reduced control over delivery schedules and quality risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us potential increases in prices potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property any of these risks may lead to increased costs or delay delivery of the company s products  which would harm its profitability and customer relationships 
additionally  the company s wafer and product requirements typically represent a relatively small portion of the total production of the third party foundries and outside assembly  testing and packaging contractors 
as a result  micrel is subject to the risk that a foundry will provide delivery or capacity priority to other larger customers at the expense of micrel  resulting in an inadequate supply to meet customer demand or higher costs to obtain the necessary product supply 
also  there is a risk that third party manufacturer will cease production on an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce the company s products 
the company cannot be certain that its outside manufacturers will continue to devote resources to the production of its products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of its products are based 
each of these events could increase the company s costs and harm its ability to deliver our products on time 
the company s product offering is concentrated and are highly dependent on certain select end markets 
the company currently sells a significant portion of its products in the high speed communications  computer  networking and wireless handset markets 
these markets are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing customer demand  evolving and competing industry standards and seasonal demand trends 
additionally  there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow 
if the markets for high speed communications  computers  networking or wireless handsets that the company serves fail to grow  or grows more slowly than it currently anticipates  or if there is increased competition in these markets  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company currently derives the majority of its product revenues from sales of standard analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and expects these products to continue to account for the majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for standard analog integrated and mixed signal circuits  such as competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a significant portion of the company s revenues in recent periods has been derived from sales of products based on sonet  sdh and atm transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  the company may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of its customers or gain substantial market acceptance 
although the company has developed products for the gigabit ethernet and fibre channel communications standards  volume sales of these products are modest  and it may not be successful in addressing other market opportunities for products based on these standards 
an important part of the company s strategy is to continue to focus on the market for high speed communications integrated circuits  or ics 
if the company is unable to penetrate this market further  the company s revenues could stop growing and may decline 
the company s ethernet products have become an important portion of the company s revenues with the acquisition of kendin 
if the company fails to develop new products to serve this market in a timely manner  or if a competitor s products unfavorably effect pricing or demand for the company s products  the company s revenues and results of operations could be adversely effected 
the markets which the company serves frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if the company s products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  it would likely lose business from existing or potential customers and would not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins until the next product transition 
if the company fails to develop products with required features or performance standards  or experiences even a short delay in bringing a new product to market  or if its customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  its revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period of time 
the company encounters risks associated with its international operations 
the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets  including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  and economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic conditions in asia or elsewhere 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is reliant on certain key suppliers for wafer fabrication  circuit assembly and testing services 
most of these suppliers are based outside of the us the company s supply could be interrupted as a result of any of the previously mentioned risk factors relating to international markets 
the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price of the company s products in the local currencies of the foreign markets it serves 
this would result in making the company s products relatively more expensive than its competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property adequately  or could be harmed by litigation involving its patents and proprietary rights 
the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages or that any of its pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
additionally  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is subject to the a risk of litigation and regulatory action in connection with the restatement of its financial statements  and the potential liability from any such litigation or regulatory action could harm its business 
on january   the company announced that it would restate its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december    and  and the fiscal quarters ended march   june   and september  as a result of this restatement  the company could become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings  or both 
as of the date hereof  the company is not aware of any litigation having been commenced against it related to this restatement 
however  such litigation could be commenced against the company in the future and  if so  the company cannot predict the outcome of any such action at this time 
however  if an unfavorable result occurred in any such action  the company s business and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  regulatory agencies  such as the securities and exchange commission  could commence a formal investigation of the company s restatement 
at this time management cannot predict whether or not any regulatory investigation related to the restatement will be commenced or  if it is  the outcome of any such investigation 
however  if any such investigation were to result in a regulatory proceeding or action against the company  its business and financial condition could be harmed 
the restatement also involves certain tax issues that we need to resolve with the appropriate taxing authorities 
the company cannot predict the results of any discussions with these authorities with respect to the tax implications of the restatement 
the company s operating results substantially depend on manufacturing output and yields  which may not meet expectations 
the company manufactures most of its semiconductors at its san jose and santa clara  california fabrication facilities 
manufacturing semiconductors requires manufacturing tools which are unique to each product being produced 
if one of these unique manufacturing tools was damaged or destroyed  then the company s ability to manufacture the related product would be impaired and its business would suffer until the tool was repaired or replaced 
additionally  the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
small impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company faces risks associated with acquisitions it has completed and will face risks associated with any future acquisitions 
the company has made four strategic acquisitions in the past three years synergy semiconductor in november  altos semiconductor inc in december  electronic technology corporation in april and kendin communications inc in may the acquisition of kendin communications inc is the largest acquisition that the company has undertaken 
the risks involved with these acquisitions and any other acquisitions include diversion of management s attention failure to retain key personnel amortization of acquired intangible assets customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations assumption of unknown liabilities any of these risks could materially harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  any acquisition involves a significant amount of integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
no assurance can be given that difficulties will not be encountered in integrating certain products  technologies or operations of the acquired companies or that the benefits expected from such integration will be realized 
there can be no assurance that any of the acquired companies will retain its key personnel  that the engineering teams of micrel and the acquired companies will successfully cooperate and realize any technological benefits or that micrel or the acquired companies will realize any of the other anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
in addition  the consummation of the kendin acquisition could result in the cancellation  termination or non renewal of arrangements with kendin by suppliers  distributors or customers of kendin or the loss of certain key kendin employees  or the termination of negotiations or delays in ordering by prospective customers of kendin as a result of uncertainties that may be perceived as a result of the acquisition 
any significant amount of cancellations  terminations  delays or non renewals of arrangements with kendin or loss of key employees or termination of negotiations or delays in ordering could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results or financial condition of kendin and micrel after the acquisition 
in addition  some of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting which means the acquisitions are subject to rules established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
these rules are complex and the interpretation of them is subject to change 
additionally  the availability of pooling of interests accounting treatment for a business combination depends in part upon circumstances and events occurring after the acquisition 
the failure of a past business combination that has been accounted for under the pooling of interests accounting method to qualify for this accounting treatment would materially harm the company s reported and future earnings and likely  the price of its common stock 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design engineers  and the company may not be able to continue to attract and train engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave its employ in the future 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to the company s product and process development programs 
our ability to manufacture sufficient wafers to meet demand could be severely hampered by natural disasters 
our existing wafer fabrication facilities are  and potential new wafer fabrication facilities may be  located in northern california and these facilities may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s business could be adversely effected by electrical power or natural gas supply interruptions 
the majority of the company s administrative  technical and manufacturing facilities are located in northern california and these facilities may be subject to electrical power or natural gas supply interruptions 
in recent months  electrical power suppliers have experienced shortages in electrical power which has resulted in brief electrical power interruptions 
the weak financial condition of california s public utilities may aggravate the situation and shortages may develop for natural gas 
semiconductor manufacturing depends upon a controlled environment which requires high usage of electrical power and natural gas 
frequent or extended electrical power interruptions could have a negative impact on production output  manufacturing yields  and manufacturing efficiencies and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or a cessation of operations 
in addition  these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities at their present locations or construct or operate a new wafer fabrication facility or could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
our failure to control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company held million in short term investments consisting of corporate debt securities commercial paper with maturities of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of this debt 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures
