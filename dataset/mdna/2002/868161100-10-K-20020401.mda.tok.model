prior to the acquisition of the bank on april   the company did not have any operations  other than the costs associated with the private placement offering 
the bank is a federally chartered savings association 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information contained in this annual report 
the company s primary asset is its investment in of the common stock of the bank and the company s operations are funded primarily from the operations of the bank 
the bank s operating subsidiaries include superior finance company superior finance  a consumer finance company  superior financial services  inc  a discount brokerage  investment advisory and insurance company  superior title services  and superior real estate holdings  inc  a real estate investment trust holding company 
in november  superior finance completed the acquisition of four consumer finance offices in north alabama for approximately  in cash from southern financial  inc  a nashville  tennessee based finance company 
the four offices had net loans outstanding of approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
restatement in the first quarter of  management of superior began evaluating the company s present and anticipated data processing needs 
as a part of this process  management entered into discussions with several vendors  including bisys  inc  the company s data processor at that time 
after consideration of the options available to the company  management decided to terminate its services agreement with bisys and so notified bisys on december  on january   bisys acknowledged receipt of the termination notice and provided superior with estimates of early termination costs based on an estimated date of deconversion from the bisys system at the end of july subsequently  bisys and superior agreed to set the deconversion on august  however  the size of the project and the technical challenges of the deconversion prompted superior in july to request a further extension to september  thereafter  a dispute arose between superior and bisys regarding superior s right to terminate the services agreement under the early termination provisions therein and superior s right to require that bisys release superior s customer data 
this dispute resulted in litigation between superior and bisys  which commenced in august in september  management of superior and representatives of bisys began to negotiate the timing  manner and cost of completing the deconversion  as well as the issues presented in the litigation 
on september  representatives of both companies scheduled face to face negotiations and agreed to delay the deconversion until october  the further delay of deconversion was required by the complexities of the deconversion process and by the uncertainties created by disruptions resulting from the events of september  on september   superior and bisys entered into a written agreement that fixed the date of deconversion at october   established a rate schedule for processing and deconversion if deconversion were not completed by november   and settled the issues under litigation 
pursuant to this agreement  superior paid bisys a lump sum amount of million  which represented payment for past processing charges  future processing through deconversion and termination and deconversion charges contractually due at the time of deconversion 
the deconversion project was completed in the fourth quarter of upon subsequent completion of its accounting analysis  superior restated prior periods financial statements to reflect adjustments for cumulative processing costs in accordance with the services agreement and to recognize the expenses of the project over the entire period in which deconversion took place  beginning with superior s notice of termination in december and ending with the completion of deconversion in november therefore  superior has restated its prior periods financial statements to reflect recognition of after tax expense of million in addition to after tax expense of thousand previously recognized in third quarter and after tax expense of thousand recognized in fourth quarter the million of after tax expense restated has been allocated as follows 
early termination fees of thousand have been expensed in the fourth quarter of based on a formula contained in the services agreement  assuming that the termination had occurred as originally scheduled in july superior has concluded that this expense was reasonably estimable at the time of the december  termination notice 
however  since the deconversion did not occur until the fourth quarter of  additional early termination fees of thousand  calculated with reference to the formula  have been expensed in each of the first  second and third quarters of 
deconversion fees of thousand have been expensed over the eight month early termination period measured from the notice of termination in december through the proposed deconversion date in july of this total  thousand has been expensed in each of the fourth quarter and the third quarter  and thousand has been expensed in each of the first and second quarters of the company allocated the deconversion fees over the early termination period because the amounts paid were attributable to additional processing costs related to deconversion and incurred throughout the deconversion process 

additional processing costs of thousand have been expensed in the third quarter of these amounts represent the rate called for under the services agreement for processing services performed beyond the early termination period 
in addition to the conversion costs described above  superior incurred certain conversion costs of thousand after tax  related primarily to training provided by the new data processor 
the restatement reflects allocation of these costs in the amounts of thousand  thousand and thousand in first  second and third quarters  respectively

any tables with data from or prior years represent amounts of the bank prior to being acquired by the company 
net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including investments and loans  exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is the principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  fee income from portfolio loans  the level of nonperforming loans and other non earning assets and the amount of noninterest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from the million for the year ended december  the net interest margin was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
for the bank  the net interest margins were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the primary difference in the net interest margin for the company and the bank is the note payable and senior notes of the company  which lowers the net interest margin from that of the bank 
for the year ended december   net interest income was million and the net interest margins for the company and the bank were and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income for over was primarily the result of lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits as a result of the falling rate environment in the bank s rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in from in  a decrease of basis points due to lower borrowing costs and deposit costs  for interest bearing demand deposits and for certificates of deposit 
the yield on assets remained fairly constant for at compared to in the yield on earning assets for the year ended and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities were and  respectively

service charges were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
service charges on deposit accounts were million for the year ended december  the increase in the number of transaction accounts and the related service fee generation is the primary reason for the growth in service charges and is largely due to the company s successful execution of its totally free checking program to customers in the markets in which the company operates 
as demonstrated by the trend from through  management believes growth will continue as the number of transaction accounts increase and the rate charged per item is increased 
noninterest expense for the year ended december   noninterest expense totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million in the efficiency ratio is equal to noninterest expense  excluding goodwill amortization  divided by the sum of noninterest income  excluding gain or loss on sale of investments  and net interest income 
for the year ended december   the efficiency ratio was compared to in for the year ended december   noninterest expense was million and the efficiency ratio was 
salary and benefit expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increases during were due primarily to the hiring of additional personnel required to accommodate loan growth  expanded products and services  additional branch offices  and temporary staff and overtime to assist in the systems conversion 
occupancy expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of thousand  or  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the opening of two new retail banking branches  relocation of three retail banking facilities  two new finance company offices and the opening of an operations center 
major categories included in occupancy expense are building lease expense  depreciation expense  and utilities 
data and item processing expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to non recurring technology conversion costs  implementation of image statement processing and growth of loan  deposit and atm accounts 
other expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million 
the increases in other expense were primarily due to the purchased mortgage valuation adjustment  and higher professional fees and communication expenses 
income taxes income tax expense includes the regular federal income tax at the statutory rate plus the income tax component of the applicable franchise taxes 
the amount of federal income tax expense is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income  the amount of nondeductible interest expense and the amount of other nondeductible expenses 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was million  a decrease of thousand or from million  as restated  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to higher levels of tax exempt income 
the effective tax rate for was compared to in  due primarily to increased income exempt from federal and state income taxes 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was million and the effective tax rate was 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

financial condition loan portfolio loans were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from billion at december  the company continues to focus on diversification of the loan portfolio  with primary emphasis on commercial and consumer direct loans 
the commercial loan portfolio  consisting of commercial and commercial owner occupied  grew during and the consumer direct portfolio grew 
the indirect loan portfolio declined and the family residential loan portfolio decreased 
contributing to the family residential loan portfolio decrease was the company s sale of approximately million of mortgages from the portfolio during the year 
the following table summarizes the loan portfolio by loan type december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial      consumer direct      indirect      real estate construction and land development      family residential 
     commercial owner occupied      the primary lending focus of the company is on small and medium sized commercial  residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the company offers a variety of commercial lending products including term loans  lines of credit and equipment financing 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both secured and unsecured  is made available to business for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment 
the purpose of a particular loan determines its structure 
generally  the company s commercial loans are underwritten in the company s primary market area on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt from income 
as a general practice  the company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate  equipment or other assets 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
a substantial portion of the company s real estate loans consists of single family residential mortgage loans collateralized by owner occupied properties located in the company s primary market area 
the company offers a variety of mortgage loan products  which generally are amortized over to years 
loans collateralized by single family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value 
the company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
consumer loans made by the company include automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  personal loans secured and unsecured and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of the loan 
a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
maturity and interest rate sensitivity of loans the following table reflects commercial and construction loans by remaining maturity and by predetermined or variable rate at december   maturing in over one one through over year or five five less years years total dollars in thousands commercial     real estate construction   total     predetermined rates     variable rates    nonperforming assets the company s asset quality remains within management s expectations  although the slowdown in the economy has contributed to the increase in nonaccrual loans 
nonperforming assets at december  were million  compared with million at december  the increase is primarily driven by the mortgage loan and consumer loan sector 
the increase in other real estate owned oreo and foreclosed property is due to residential mortgages and one commercial real estate credit 
this resulted in a ratio of nonperforming assets to loans plus other real estate of  and 
as of year end and  respectively 
the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio was

the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      other real estate and foreclosed property  total nonperforming assets      nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate 




the company has well developed procedures in place to maintain a high quality loan portfolio 
these procedures begin with approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors  low individual lending limits for officers  senior loan committee approval for large credit relationships and quality loan documentation procedures 
the loan review department identifies and analyzes weaknesses in the portfolio and reports credit risk grade changes on a quarterly basis to bank management and directors 
the company also maintains a well developed monitoring process for credit extensions 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers 
the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends  and collection efforts are done on a centralized basis 
the company also has procedures to bring rapid resolution of non performing loans and prompt and orderly liquidation of real estate  automobiles and other forms of collateral 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory 
all loans past due days  however  are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring 
the company regularly updates appraisals on loans collateralized by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the company had no non government sponsored accruing loans that were contractually past due days or more 
however  the company continues to accrue interest for government sponsored loans such as fha insurance and va guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of accruing loans past due days or more was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company records real estate acquired by foreclosure at the lesser of the outstanding loan balance  net of any reduction in basis  or the fair value at the time of foreclosure  less estimated costs to sell 
purchased mortgage valuation in the second quarter of  superior purchased from a secondary servicer an assignment of an approximately million portfolio of fha insured and va guaranteed mortgages on a servicing retained basis 
the purchase contract provided that superior would receive a pass through net yield of and that the loans would be paid off upon foreclosure and the servicer s receipt of the individual claims from either fha or va 
in the third quarter of  the primary seller servicer filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy was subsequently converted to a chapter proceeding in which superior has filed a million proof of claim 
superior then entered into a fee based sub servicing agreement with the secondary servicer 
in the fourth quarter of  superior s management became aware of  and brought to the secondary servicer s attention  increasing discrepancies in the two companies respective net valuations of the portfolio 
at this time  management also notified the secondary servicer that superior regarded the secondary servicer as in breach of certain representations and warranties made in connection with the assignment 
the two companies entered into ongoing discussions to resolve these differences 
although the secondary servicer continues to remit principal and interest collections to superior  in the first quarter of superior decided to recognize any interest income on the portfolio only after it had received payments sufficient to recover remaining current portfolio balances 
consequently  no net interest income was recognized in on the portfolio 
at year end  management reviewed superior s net valuation of the portfolio and  based on ordinary contingencies of recovery in the bankruptcy of the primary seller servicer and claims against the secondary servicer  management has further reduced its valuation of the portfolio by an additional thousand after tax  or earnings per diluted share 
the remaining balance of the portfolio is currently million 
superior will continue to apply the cost recovery method in accounting for these assets during allowance for loan losses the following table presents  for the periods indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data years ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses at january      provision for loan losses      charge offs commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer      total charge offs      recoveries commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer     total recoveries     net charge offs      allowance for loan losses at december      allowance to period end loans net charge offs to average loans allowance to period end nonperforming loans the company continuously monitors its underwriting procedures in an attempt to maintain loan quality 
additionally  the company is executing a strategy of achieving more balance between the amount of commercial  mortgage  and consumer loans outstanding 
this strategy has resulted in growth of commercial  construction  commercial real estate  and consumer direct loans while mortgage loans and indirect consumer loans have declined 
the provisions to the allowance for loan losses are based on management s judgment and evaluation of the loan portfolio using both objective and subjective criteria 
the objective criteria used by the company to assess the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and required additions to such allowance are i an internal grading system  ii a peer group analysis  and iii a historical analysis 
in addition to these objective criteria  the company subjectively assesses adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the need for additions thereto  with consideration given to the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  national  regional and local business and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay or the value of collateral securing the loans  and other relevant factors 
the company s allowance for loan losses was million at december  and december   or of total loans 
while management believes the current allowance is adequate  changing economic and other conditions may require future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses 
the company uses an internal credit grading system in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this analysis assigns grades to all loans except owner occupied family residential loans and consumer loans 
graded loans are assigned to one of nine risk reserve allocation percentages 
the loan grade for each individual loan is determined by the loan officer at the time it is made and changed from time to time to reflect an ongoing assessment of loan risk 
loan grades are reviewed on specific loans from time to time by senior management and as part of the company s internal loan review process 
owner occupied family residential and consumer loans are assigned a reserve allocation percentage based on past due status and the level of cumulative gross charge offs for the five preceding calendar years 
the sum of all reserve amounts determined by this methodology is used by management as the primary indicator of the appropriate allowance level 
during  the company reassigned the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan types in the total loan portfolio 
this reassignment of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was done to coincide with the shift in the mix and the risk profile of the overall loan portfolio 
given this shift in the mix of the overall loan portfolio and the fact that the economy was slowing  management wanted an unallocated allowance for loan losses responsive to this change 
therefore  the percentage of the allowance for loan losses allocated to the commercial  construction and land development and commercial owner occupied portfolio increased from of the total allowance for loan losses at december  to at december   while the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses decreased from to for the same period 
the unallocated allowance compensates for the uncertainty in estimating loan losses including factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination of the allowance allocation percentages 
the factors and conditions evaluated in determining the appropriate unallocated allowance may include the following i general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  ii credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  iii trends that could affect collateral values  iv loan volumes and concentrations  v seasoning of the loan portfolio  vi specific industry conditions affecting portfolio segments  vii recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  viii duration of the current business cycle  ix bank regulatory examination results and x findings of internal loan review department 
the company subjectively assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by considering the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  national  regional and local business and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay or the value of collateral securing the loans  and other relevant factors 
although the company does not determine the overall allowance based upon the amount of loans in a particular type or category except in the case of owner occupied family residential and consumer installment loans  risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered in assigning loan grades to individual loans 
these risk elements include the following i for non farm non residential loans and multifamily residential loans  the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements  operating results of the owner in the case of owner occupied properties  the loan to value ratio  the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income  property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type  ii for construction and land development loans  the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or ability to lease property constructed for lease  the quality and nature of contracts for presale or preleasing if any  experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratios  iii for commercial and industrial loans  the operating results of the commercial  industrial or professional enterprise  the borrower s business  professional and financial ability and expertise  the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value  nature and marketability of collateral 
in addition  for each category the company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors 
management reviews the allowance on a quarterly basis to determine whether the amount of regular monthly provision should be increased or decreased or whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance 
the allowance is determined by management s assessment and grading of individual loans in the case of loans other than owner occupied family residential and consumer loans and specific reserves made for other categories of loans 
the total allowance amount is available to absorb losses across the company s entire portfolio 
the following tables describe the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated

charge offs for the years have primarily been in the indirect consumer loan portfolio 
investments the company s investment portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets 
it provides a significant source of revenue for the company and acts as a source of funding should the company experience unanticipated deposit withdrawals or loan demand 
at the date of purchase  the company is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that the company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale or trading and carried at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale are carried as a separate component of stockholders equity 
all investments held by the company as of december   and are classified as available for sale 
the following table presents the amortized cost and estimated market values for investments as of the dates shown

the weighted average yield on investments was in  in  and in during  the company purchased million of federal tax exempt municipal bonds  million of agency bonds and million of corporate securities 
with the anticipated growth in deposits and loans  management expects that the investment portfolio will remain at approximately the december  level during the company did not hold any investments classified as trading securities during  or the company has no mortgage backed securities that have been issued by non agency entities 
at december   of investments available for sale held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
at december   approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities earned interest at floating rates and repriced within one year  and accordingly were less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase  but benefit less than fixed rate securities in value changes during a time of declining interest rates 
the following table summarizes the amortized cost  by contractual maturity  of investments including federal home loan bank stock and interest bearing deposits and their weighted average tax equivalent yields

the company has  through various contractual arrangements  fully and unconditionally guaranteed all obligations of superior statutory trust on a subordinated basis with respect to the preferred securities 
subject to certain limitations  the preferred securities qualify as tier i capital and are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in the company s subordinated debentures 
the sole asset of superior statutory trust is the subordinated debentures issued by the company 
both the preferred securities of superior statutory trust and the subordinated debentures of the company will mature on december   however  they may be prepaid  subject to regulatory approval  prior to maturity at any time on or after december   or earlier upon certain changes in tax or investment company laws or regulatory capital requirements 
the interest rate on the company s subordinated debentures is libor plus adjusted quarterly  which was at december  this interest rate is subject to a cap of annually 
distributions are paid quarterly 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to the company s overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews the company s liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  retail and institutional deposit activity  current market conditions  and interest rates on both a local and national level 
see investments 
the company reports to the board of directors rate sensitive assets minus rate sensitive liabilities divided by total earning assets on a cumulative basis quarterly 
at december   this ratio was a positive 
the company estimates that a basis point change in interest rates would have no significant impact on its net interest income over a twelve month period 
the committee regularly reviews interest rate risk exposure by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
while the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on the measure 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  as the interest rate environment has become more volatile  the company s management has increased monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position and the effect of various interest rate environments on earnings 
us money market interest rate market presents the primary risk exposure to the company 
in measuring and managing interest rate risk  the company uses gap analysis  net interest income simulation  and economic value equity modeling 
the following table sets forth a gap interest rate sensitivity analysis for the bank as of december  assets and liabilities of the company have been excluded 
period cumulative gap analysis after one days days days year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets money market funds   investments      loans      total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits   certificates of deposit and other time deposits      borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities 
     period gap      cumulative gap     period gap to earning assets cumulative gap to earning assets the gap sensitivity analysis shows when balances may be repriced 
net interest income  however  is also affected by how much the interest rates change for each of the balances 
for example  when national money market rates change  interest rates on the company s savings accounts may not change as much as interest rates on its commercial loans 
this is a limiting factor for the gap analysis 
management does not believe that the million note and the line of credit into which it was converted on april   and the million of senior notes used to finance the acquisition of the bank have a significant impact on the company s interest rate exposure 
the note had  and the line of credit has a floating interest rate based upon libor 
the senior notes mature on april  and have a fixed interest rate 
the combination of these two financing options minimize the impact of the interest rate changes of the risk profile of the company 
as of december   the company s net interest income simulation model indicates that a parallel basis point increase in interest rates along the yield curve would lower net interest income by up to for the next months  while a basis point decrease would raise net interest income by up to 
the model includes balances  asset prepayment speeds  and the interest rate relationships among balances that management judges to be reasonable for the various interest rate environments 
differences in actual occurrences from these assumptions  as well as non parallel changes in the yield curve  may change the company s market risk exposure 
among the interest rate relationships  there are caps and floors on the bank s portfolio of adjustable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the company manages its interest rate risk through investment in appropriate fixed and variable rate assets  acquisition of non rate sensitive core deposits  and adjustments in maturities of federal home loan bank advances 
the bank does not use off balance sheet instruments 
since year end  short term interest rates are essentially unchanged 
however  intermediate and longer term interest rates have risen  so that there is a sharply positive yield curve through five years with a more normal positive slope thereafter 
employment  production  and gross domestic product data indicate that the recession may have ended 
the federal reserve s open market committee has changed its monetary posture from risk of economic weakness to a balanced risk  and federal reserve governors have spoken of potential increases in short term rates as the year progresses 
capital resources stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was the result of the million in net income for  million improvement in the net equity adjustment from the unrealized gain on available for sale investments  a million reduction for treasury stock and a dividend declared of thousand

 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas eliminated the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and provided new definitions for intangible assets that must be recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas was adopted on july  sfas established new rules of accounting for intangible assets 
under these new rules  intangible assets with indefinite lives such as goodwill will no longer be amortized over their useful lives 
subsequent to the issuance of sfas  the fasb issued an interpretation that the unidentifiable intangible asset that results from certain business combinations  such as branch acquisitions  must continue to be amortized over periods determined by the expected lives of the acquired assets and deposits 
the fasb is currently reconsidering this interpretation 
the company has adopted sfas as of january  net income and earnings per diluted share for and would have been million or diluted earnings per share and million  as restated  or diluted earnings per share  as restated  respectively  if sfas had been effective for those years 
during  the company will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill 
the effect of these tests on earnings and financial position has not yet been determined
