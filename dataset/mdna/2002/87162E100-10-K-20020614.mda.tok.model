item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategy synthetech s strategy is to emphasize a commitment to its customers from the early phases of discovery through clinical development in order to develop larger orders as the products receive regulatory approval 
product overview peptide building blocks 
pbbs are amino acids that have been chemically modified through organic chemistry and biocatalysis techniques to enable them to link with other amino acids or chemicals in a particular defined sequence 
these pbbs are used as starting materials in the manufacture of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs  and for the cosmeceutical product 
the amino acids which are transformed into pbbs may be either natural amino acids that is  amino acids which occur in nature  including their chiral or mirror image form or synthetic amino acids that is  amino acids which have a side chain that does not occur in nature 
synthetech refers to the synthetic amino acids as specialty amino acids 
since  the company has produced a wide range of natural amino acid pbb products 
the company has also developed and manufactures over three dozen specialty amino acids 
the company uses a wide array of raw materials to produce pbbs 
these materials generally are in adequate supply from multiple suppliers 
the company has developed and scaled up process technology to produce this wide range of pbb products in a grams to tons scale 
the company continues to produce most bulk orders on an as page ordered basis 
the company also maintains small inventory quantities of many pbbs  permitting immediate deliveries 
at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders was million  all of which the company expects to ship during fiscal at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders was million 
marketing the company markets its products and capabilities through attendance at trade shows  listings in biotechnology and chemical industry directories  advertisements in chemical trade periodicals and an internet presence 
in addition  the company maintains ongoing direct relationships with major pharmaceutical firms  emerging biopharmaceutical firms  contract drug synthesis firms and other firms that it believes might have a need for its products 
the company typically sells its products directly to its customers  although it uses independent sales representatives for some european sales in switzerland and france  and has usually sold products to japanese customers through chemical trading firms 
in january  the company added dr 
michael cannarsa to the management team as the company s director of business development 
dr 
cannarsa has reinforced and expanded the company s efforts in sales and marketing  and has been exploring suitable opportunities for complementary product lines and technology licensing 
dr 
cannarsa brings to synthetech a strong technology background  coupled with extensive commercial development experience in pharmaceutical intermediates and chiral fine chemicals 
he is based strategically in the philadelphia area in close proximity to large pharmaceutical companies that are located in the northeastern united states and within easy access to european customers 
customers although the company has several hundred customers in more than countries  the company expects that a few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues each year 
during fiscal  the top customers represented over of the company s revenues 
of these ten customers  five were major pharmaceutical companies  two were emerging biopharmaceutical companies  two were contract drug synthesis companies  and one was a cosmeceutical company 
the company had three customers each accounting for over of fiscal revenues f 
hoffman la roche  ltd  telik  inc and procyte corporation  which individually accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s fiscal revenues 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  sales to international customers were million  million  and million  respectively  accounting for approximately   and  of the company s total revenues 
these sales were principally to europe for fiscal and fiscal  and to europe and mexico for fiscal see note j to financial statements 
competition because peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs are relatively new  the market in the past for pbbs has been quite small with sales typically in the hundreds of kilos or smaller size 
as a result  the pbb market has not attracted a significant amount of direct competition 
as the market continues to grow with larger order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in multi kilo quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to page attract a wider group of approximately a dozen domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of specialty amino acids  the company has competition on a selected product basis at the multi kilo scale from approximately half a dozen fine chemical producers in europe  japan and the united states 
competition from companies in developing countries  such as india  china and korea  is also starting to emerge 
competition also increases for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into approved status as a result of the increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
many of the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
the principal methods of competition in the market for pbbs and other fine chemicals are quality  delivery responsiveness  customer service and price 
the company believes that it competes effectively in each of these areas 
the company also believes that its production of a wide range of products and quantities gives it a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
in addition  the company believes that pharmaceutical companies generally view internal production of pbbs as a misallocation of resources and  given a reliable source of a quality product  would rather obtain them from an outside supplier 
research and development the company s research and development group is composed of eight degreed chemists  of which three have advanced degrees in chemistry 
the company s research and development efforts focus on process development to support the company s pbb product lines 
in addition  the group explores alternative scaleable routes for pbb production  especially for its specialty amino acids 
the company expanded its research staff in fiscal to place renewed emphasis on developing novel technologies to match identifiable market trends and business opportunities 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  the company s research and development expenses were   and  respectively 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
employees as of may   the company employed individuals 
regulatory matters as the company s products are intermediates sold to drug manufacturers  the company has been generally unaffected by fda regulation which is directed at the drug manufacturers 
similar factors apply to the company s sale of pbbs for the cosmeceutical 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing under fda s good manufacturing practice cgmp guidelines  the company expects these programs will often include more extensive quality assurance systems and documentation 
the company anticipates that the expenses of implementing these programs will increase in the future 
the company s business is also subject to substantial regulation in the areas of safety  environmental control and hazardous waste management 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with page these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
as additional and more extensive regulations are being added in these areas at the federal  state and local levels  the compliance costs will inevitably continue to increase 
the operation of fine chemical manufacturing plants entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or an unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
also  the company generates hazardous and other wastes that are disposed at various off site facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabil ities incurred at these disposal facilities due to releases of such substances into the environment 
in fiscal  the company undertook capital expenditures relating to regulatory matters aggregating million associated with the waste water treatment facility project 
the company is anticipating capital expenditures relating to regulatory matters of approximately  in fiscal for equipment 
the company maintains property damage insurance  liability insurance  environmental risk insurance  and product liability insurance  which may be inadequate to cover its potential environmental liabilities 
product liability use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such products involves an inherent risk of product liability 
there can be no assurance that claims for product liability will not be asserted against the company or that the company would be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company maintains product liability insurance with a million limit per occurrence and a million aggregate limit 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage  which may be inadequate to cover its potential liabilities 
company background the company was formed in to develop novel chemical process technology by combining classical organic chemistry with enzyme based biocatalysis 
for the first several years  it operated mainly as a research and development group focused on process development of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals 
after its initial public offering in  the company s research efforts were concentrated on the development of a proprietary process for aspartame and l phenylalanine 
although the company has entered into one license for this technology  the company discontinued marketing this technology in and does not expect additional licensing revenue 
throughout its development during the s  the company also offered contract research services 
these research services were typically provided to pharmaceutical clients and generally involved the development of biocatalytic processes that is  chemical processes which are affected by the use of enzymes or micro organisms 
since the end of fiscal  the company has phased out contract research services and does not anticipate receiving any significant revenue from research services in the future 
by the end of the s  the company  building on prior experience  began to focus on the production of pbbs and other fine chemicals for customers 
with the successful completion of two large scale orders  the company has demonstrated its capability as a full cycle grams to tons pbb producer 
page factors affecting future results you should carefully consider the following factors that may affect our business  future operating results and financial condition  as well as other information included in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
uncertain market for products  customer concentration  and potential quarterly revenue fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced from time to time substantial period to period revenue fluctuations reflecting the industry environment in which the company has operated 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs  and cosmeceuticals into which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drug development  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda  and  even if approved  the ultimate potential of such drugs 
recurring sales of pbbs for discovery or clinical trial stage development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from year to year and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales and the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
since the company s revenues are composed of pbb sales in all three drug development stages  and since even sales of pbbs for marketed drugs are subject to cancellation or reduction  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
the company faces similar challenges in any sales for the cosmeceutical market 
key personnel 
the company s success depends largely on its president and ceo  its vice president of operations  its director of business development and other key employees 
the company does not have key man life insurance on any of these employees 
if one or more of these key employees were to resign  the loss could result in delays to production  loss of sales  and diversion of management resources 
as announced earlier in  charlie williams  the vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer  who has been with the company since  will retire in july  although he is expected to continue as a member of the board of directors 
the company has hired mr 
gary weber to replace mr 
williams as vice president of finance and administration and cfo 
mr 
weber is expected to start employment in june  synthetech s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for exper ienced technical  sales and marketing personnel in the industry 
if synthetech is unable to retain its existing personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  it may from time to time experience page inadequate levels of staffing which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s growth could be limited due to its lack of capacity to produce and market products to customers or it could experience deterioration in service or decreased customer satisfaction 
competition 
in the past  the company has not had a significant amount of direct competition for discovery and clinical trial stage drug development projects 
the company believes that this resulted from peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs  particularly those that utilize synthetic amino acids  being relatively new and the market for pbbs relatively small 
as the market has continued to grow with multi ton order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in the multi kilo or smaller quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of synthetic amino acid based pbbs  the company has competition on a selective product basis from fine chemical producers in europe and japan 
competition from companies in developing countries  such as india  china and korea  is also starting to emerge 
competition has also increased for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into an approved status as a result of increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
risks of technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies 
the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  and technological developments could cause the company s products and technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
industry cost factors 
the market for pbbs used by pharmaceutical companies is dependent on the market for pharmaceutical products 
the levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
in addition  in both the united states and elsewhere  sales of prescription pharmaceuticals are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payors such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and service s 
peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs may not be considered cost effective  and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow these drugs to be sold on a profitable basis 
in addition  as cost pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have tightened  the cancellation rate for drug development programs has increased 
industry cost pressures can also cause pharmaceutical companies to investigate alternative drug manufacturing processes that may not include pbbs 
production factors 
synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability and has made over products 
with over years of experience  synthetech has developed extensive peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule process technology 
nevertheless  initial batches of new products and scaling up production of existing products may result in significantly lower than expected yields or may page require substantial rework to meet the required specification 
production of new products may even result in total write offs 
regulatory matters 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require the company to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a chemical manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be in curred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
the company has recently implemented a formal substance abuse testing program for all employees 
in addition  the company generates hazardous materials and other wastes  which are disposed at various offsite facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
the company has obtained environmental risk insurance  which may be inadequate to cover its potential environmental liabilities 
potential regulation 
the pbbs produced by the company are intermediate ingredients which are then processed by the companies to which they are sold  and are therefore currently not subject to the requirements of the fda 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing  the company believes that these programs will often become more extensive 
accordingly  the company expects its compliance documentation efforts will continue to increase and anticipates that the expenses of implementing such programs will increase in the future 
it is also possible that in the future the company may not be able to comply with the applicable documentation or such documentation may require sub stantial incremental expense for additional labor and capital 
risks of international business 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended march  the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales 
the company s business is and will be subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign governmental regulation and changes in economic conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell its products in international markets 
in addition  the company s sale of its products is subject to the risks associated with legislation and regulation relating to imports  including quotas  duties or taxes and other charges  restrictions and retaliatory actions on imports into other countries in which the company s products may be sold 
the company is also subje ct to similar risks with respect to the importation of raw materials from foreign countries 
manufacturing capacity 
as a manufacturer of pbbs  the company will continually face risks regarding the availability and costs of raw materials and labor  the potential need for additional capital equipment  increased maintenance costs  plant and equipment obsolescence and quality control 
the company has constructed additional manufacturing and related facilities on its site in albany  oregon 
page nevertheless  existing facilities may not have sufficient capacity to meet the future demand for the company s products 
a disruption in the company s production or distribution could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
conversely  the company may not have sufficient demand to utilize the additional capacity  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
product liability 
use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such products involves an inherent risk of product liability 
claims for product liability could be asserted against the company and the company may not be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company has purchased product liability insurance with a million limit per occurrence and a million aggregate limit 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage  which may be inadequate to cover its potential liabilities 
change in independent public auditors 
in may  the company dismissed arthur andersen llp  which had audited the company s financial statements since  and engaged kpmg llp to audit the company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended march  and the fiscal year ending march  the company has not been able to obtain arthur andersen s consent to incorporate by reference the audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and into the company s existing registration statements 
because the company has not been able to obtain such consent  recovery of damages by investors in the company s common stock sold pursuant to those registration statements may be limited 
item properties synthetech s headquarters and production facility are located in albany  oregon 
the company purchased this albany  oregon property in since then  it has undergone a number of plant and building expansions on site 
at present  the company s facilities  which aggregate  square feet  include production  pilot plant  laboratory  warehouse and office space 
these facilities include a recently constructed separate  square foot production facility with six production bays 
three of these bays have been outfitted with reactor vessels and other equipment and are operational 
a fourth bay has been outfitted with reactor vessels and other equipment and can be completed and put into service as the company needs additional capacity 
the final two bays remain vacant and available for future expansion 
to accomplish the plant expansions  synthetech has contracted with various third party providers 
the company typically has issued purchase orders to such providers with detailed specifications  services to be provided and the prices to be paid 
the company has received either limited or no written warranties by such third party providers and  therefore  may be limited in its ability to pursue remedies in the event that the new building has problems or other defects in the future 
however  the building has been inspected by the city of albany to verify that  as constructed  it meets all applicable building codes  including ada  electrical  seismic  fire and hazardous occupancy 
all specifications were reviewed by an independent third party engineering firm selected by the city of albany prior to approval of various construction permits 
in november  the company completed the wastewater treatment system that it began in fiscal with preliminary design work and some purchases of equipment 
the total investment in the on site wastewater treatment system was million 
the company completed a major million research page and development r d lab remodel in may the company s state of the art  square foot facility includes chemical fume hoods  hvac units and a hepa filtered clean packaging room 
there is also room for future expansion of an additional four fume hoods 
previously  in fiscal  the million second phase expansion in the company s new plant was primarily complete and operational  except for some finishing expenditures in fiscal the second phase expansion outfitted additional bays of the new plant with four additional multipurpose reactor systems and constructed additional warehouse  bulk storage and related facilities 
on may   the company agreed to purchase a acre property adjacent to its existing site for  the adjacent property includes nearly  square feet of office space and  square feet of warehouse space 
the company needs additional office space and has determined that this acquisition is a more advantageous alternative to expanding office space in its existing administration building 
there is also the potential for future expansion on the vacant portion of the adjacent property 
the company s current site is fully built out and cannot accommodate any additional building expansion 
the company expects to complete the purchase and take possession of the property by july  item legal proceedings we are not involved in any material litigation

year ended march  in thousands  except per share data statements of operations data revenues gross profit loss operating income loss net income loss basic earnings loss per share diluted earnings loss per share march  in thousands balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents working capital total assets long term debt retained earnings shareholders equity page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability to produce synthetically manufactured amino acid derivatives  small peptides  and similar intermediates referred to as peptide building blocks or pbbs 
this full cycle pbb production capability reinforces synthetech s long term growth strategy emphasizing a commitment to its customers from the early phases of research and discovery through regulatory trials and culminating in marketed product 
fiscal results included million revenues from pbb orders for three customers 
however  the lack of other projects with significant revenues and a higher breakeven point resulting from increased expenses associated with synthetech s plant build out contributed substantially to a second consecutive year of operating losses 
despite the loss for fiscal  the company generated  of cash from fiscal operations 
this cash flow  together with its financial reserves  enabled synthetech to continue significant improvements in its facilities and organization 
the company completed a million investment in an on site wastewater treatment system and hired several experienced chemists following the r d lab remodel completed in may see liquidity and capital resources below 
looking ahead to fiscal  the company has significant orders for pbbs from three projects for the customers mentioned above 
these orders represent million of the million backlog of orders at march  shipments of pbbs for these projects accounted for million of fiscal revenues 
two of the orders are for pharmaceuticals  one of which is to support production of launch volumes of a drug in late stage clinical trials and the other is currently in phase two clinical trials 
the third order is for a cosmeceutical 
synthetech remains well positioned for growth and active as a supplier of pbbs for several pharmaceutical development projects in clinical trials 
although the progress and timing of these projects remain outside the company s control  we believe that there are a number of different combinations with the potential to generate substantial future revenues 
see industry factors below 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our financial statements 
inventory reserves we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product shelf life  estimated market values and other factors 
raw materials and work in progress are reviewed periodically by our operating personnel for obsolescence 
finished goods are reviewed periodically by operating personnel to determine if page inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover 
bad debts have not historically been significant 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
revenue recognition revenue is recorded from customers upon product completion and delivery  title and risk of loss have been passed to the customer 
sales returns have not historically been significant  thus no reserve for sales returns has generally been provided 
page operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by each item included in the statements of operations 
percentage of revenues fiscal year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss other income interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss revenues synthetech revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  reflecting the unpredictability and potential for significant revenue fluctuations associated with the industry environment in which the company operates 
revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal synthetech s revenue increase in fiscal compared to fiscal and the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal were largely due to the presence or absence of individually large projects with significant revenues 
revenues from significant orders were million   and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million of revenues in fiscal were for three orders using the company s pbbs 
the  in fiscal was for a pbb to be used in pre launch and page market launch quantities of a cosmeceutical  a product which makes no therapeutic claims but is intended for human use 
the company is continuing to produce pbbs for this cosmeceutical 
the million revenue in fiscal was attributable to the completion of a significant pbb order for a marketed drug initially received in fiscal this order provided million of revenue in fiscal the company estimates that in fiscal approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical  approximately went into drugs in clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal  the company estimates that approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs and cosmeceuticals  approximately went into drugs in clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal  the company estimates that approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately went into drugs in clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
these estimates are based on an analysis of the company s sales  publicly available information and information to the extent available from customers 
the level of synthetech s business from period to period continues to be unpredictable to a large extent 
although pbb sales associated with marketed drugs are more likely to provide a longer term  ongoing revenue stream than sales associated with drugs at the clinical or discovery stages  continuation of customer demand for pbbs associated with marketed drugs remains subject to various market conditions  including potential use of alternative manufacturing routes  continued market demand for the drug and competition from other suppliers of pbbs 
for example  the customer to whom the company shipped million for a fiscal pbb order adopted an alternative  lower cost manufacturing route that does not use synthetech s pbb and has not placed any additional orders 
accordingly  while significant orders for marketed drugs can provide substantial and predictable revenues for the duration of the orders  we expect revenues to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
the level of synthetech s business from period to period at the clinical and discovery stages remains unpredictable as well 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal the company received a million order for use in a drug in clinical trials 
the customer s inability to source raw materials in a timely manner for the order  and a subsequent curtailed and revised scope of this project  resulted in only  of product being shipped during fiscal and the payment to the company of a  idle equipment reservation fee in the fourth quarter of fiscal under the revised scope of this project  synthetech received million for this project in the first half of fiscal but received no additional orders 
with this industry environment  it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future business 
the company s backlog of pbb orders at march  was million compared to a backlog at march  of million 
this backlog includes a million order for the supply of pbbs to support production of a pharmaceutical in phase two clinical trials  million to support production of launch volumes of a drug in late stage clinical trials and  for ongoing volumes of a cosmeceutical 
these orders reflect continuing requirements for the respective pbbs  pending favorable results in clinical trials  in market launch and other factors 
the company expects that additional orders will be received during fiscal all three of synthetech s customers for these projects have indicated that there will be orders for additional production in fiscal we believe these potential additional orders could provide significant revenues during the second half of fiscal synthetech remains well positioned for growth and active as a supplier of pbbs for several pharmaceutical development projects in clinical trials 
although the progress and timing of these projects page remain outside the company s control  there are a number of different combinations with the potential to generate substantial future revenues

gross profit loss cost of revenues in fiscal was million  resulting in a gross loss of  the gross loss of  in fiscal compared to the gross profit of  in fiscal represented a decrease 
gross profit decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal this reflects a decrease in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of revenues  gross profit loss margins were  and in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
cost of revenues includes raw materials consumed  all labor  facility and similar expenses incurred by the company s manufacturing department during the period  including expenses not directly allocated to manufacturing the products sold during the period  and adjustments to inventory 
the plant expansions over the past several years and recent increases to personnel have significantly contributed to the increase in fixed manufacturing costs included in cost of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  cost of revenues in fiscal included added costs associated with approximately  in inventory write offs primarily resulting from production batches not meeting specification 
the decrease in the gross profit margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal principally reflected the downward pressure caused by a lower level of revenues in fiscal combined with the increased manufacturing overhead cost associated with the plant expansions 
cost of reven ues included million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  of unallocated manufacturing overhead ie  cost not directly allocable to production projects 
to a lesser extent  the gross loss in fiscal was impacted by lower than expected yields and product rework associated with production scale up of certain existing products and initial production batches of certain new products 
see industry factors below 
operating expenses research and development expense increased to  or of sales  in fiscal  from  or of sales  in fiscal r d expense was  or  in fiscal the increase in r d expense in fiscal primarily reflected increased depreciation costs and supplies expense associated with the lab remodel completed in may of  and the hiring of additional staff during the year 
the company expects r d expense to increase in future periods due to the hiring of additional r d staff in connection with the expanded capacity that resulted from the completion of the r d lab remodel 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was million  million and million  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in sg a expense in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected the increased cost associated with the addition of a member to the company s marketing staff 
the increase in sg a in fiscal from fiscal principally reflected an increase in salary in these groups and due to an increase in headcount 
sg a as a percentage of sales was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating income loss the company s operating loss increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal operating income was million in fiscal in fiscal  company wide labor costs increased to million from million in fiscal  principally reflecting the increase in compensation page expense due to an increase in headcount 
in fiscal  company wide labor costs decreased to million from million in fiscal  principally reflecting the absence of an employee bonus pool 
the employee bonus pool has not been in effect since fiscal due to the company s financial results 
other income  net the  other income  net in fiscal included  in interest earnings plus miscellaneous earnings 
the  other income  net in fiscal included  in interest earnings less miscellaneous expenses 
the  other income  net in fiscal included  of interest earnings less miscellaneous expenses 
interest earnings are the result of cash invested in interest bearing money market accounts 
net income loss in fiscal  the company had a million loss before income taxes 
due to this loss  the company received an income tax benefit of  resulting in a net loss of million for fiscal in fiscal  the company had a million loss before income taxes 
due to this loss  the company received an income tax benefit of  resulting in a net loss of  for fiscal in fiscal  the company earned million before income taxes 
a provision for income taxes of  resulted in net income of million 
the effective tax rates for the company were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the company being in a profit position rather than a loss position and the resulting utilization of the foreign sales corporation tax benefit in fiscal and industry factors market factors the company manufactures pbbs for use in synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the drugs in which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of these drug development efforts  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda or  even if approved  the ultimate market potential of the drugs 
the company also manufactures pbbs for use in a cosmeceutical  and faces similar factors in that market 
the three stages of the drug development process include r d or discovery stage  clinical trial stage and marketed drug stage 
synthetech s customers can spend years researching and developing new drugs  and take only a small percentage to clinical trials and fewer yet to commercial market 
a substantial amount of the activity continues to occur at the earlier stages of research and development and clinical trials 
the market for peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs is still developing 
recurring sales of pbbs for development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level and timing of orders by the company s customers relating to specific drug development programs varies substantially from quarter to quarter and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs can also provide an opportunity for continuing  page longer term sales 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
also  industry cost pressures can cause pharmaceutical companies to explore and ultimately adopt alternative manufacturing processes that may not include the company s pbbs as an intermediate 
finally  with longer term  significant or large scale orders  the company expects increased competition to supply these pbbs 
similar dynamics affect the cosmeceutical development process and market  except that the regulatory oversight and  consequently  the typical length of a product s time to market is reduced 
cosmeceutical products make no therapeutic claims and  accordingly  the more extensive and time consuming clinical trials to establish efficacy are not required 
the foregoing industry factors create an inability for the company to predict future demand beyond its current order base 
until the company develops a stable baseload of demand  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
production factors synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability and has made over products 
with over years of experience  synthetech has developed extensive pbb process technology and is recognized as one of the leaders in this area 
nevertheless  initial batches of new products and scaling up production processes of existing products may result in significantly lower than expected yields and extended processing time  and may require substantial rework to meet the required specification 
these factors could cause increased costs and delay shipments and  thus  affect periodic operating results 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of million compared to million at march  the company s cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled million compared to million at march  this million reduction in cash and cash equivalents principally reflected million of capital expenditures partially offset by  received from operating activities during fiscal the company invests its cash in low risk money market accounts 
in addition  the company has a million unsecured bank line of credit that had no amount outstanding at march  the increase in accounts receivable to million at march  from million at march  primarily reflected differences in the timing of shipments between the periods 
the decrease in income tax receivable to  at march  from  at march  reflected changes in the tax benefit for fiscal the decrease in inventory to million at march  from million at march  primarily reflected a decrease in finished goods 
the decrease in accounts payable to  at march  from  at march  primarily reflected the reduction of expenditure commitments related to capital projects between the two periods 
in fiscal  the company completed the wastewater treatment system that it began in fiscal with preliminary design work and some purchases of equipment 
the total investment in the on site wastewater treatment system was million 
the system began initial start up operations in september and was fully operational in november page the company had approximately million of capital expenditures during fiscal which included  for equipment and equipment upgrades in the existing plant   for completion of the r d lab remodel  and million for equipment purchases and installation relating to the wastewater treatment system 
the company anticipates total fiscal capital expenditures for the existing plant to be approximately million  and an additional  to purchase property and office space adjacent to the company and to equip the office space 
the company expects to finance all capital expenditures from internal cash flow and does not anticipate the need for any new debt or equity financing 
the company owns its facility and all of its equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk synthetech s primary market risk exposure is the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest income earned on our cash deposits and cash equivalents 
the risks associated with market  liquidity and principal are mitigated by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of synthetech s investments 
substantially all of the synthetech s purchases and sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to any of its purchases and sales 
synthetech does not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the synthetech s operating results or cash flows
