item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the company manufactures and markets premium products and services to the oil and gas exploration and production and petrochemical industries and other industrial markets 
the company s worldwide operations are largely driven by the level of exploration and production activity in major energy producing areas and the depth and drilling conditions of these projects 
drilling activity levels are primarily influenced by energy prices but may also be affected by expectations related to the worldwide supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  capital expenditure plans of exploration and production companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
the company s results will be influenced by the anticipated percent to percent reduction in average worldwide activity levels during associated with the global economic slowdown 
however  the effect of the decline in drilling activity is expected to be partially offset by the impact of acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of the majority of the year over year reduction in drilling activity is expected to be reported in the united states 
the us rig count is currently percent below the average level reported in due principally to the decline in land based drilling programs  which are generally more sensitive to energy prices 
drilling activity in many international markets  which is driven primarily by oil directed spending  has not been significantly impacted to date 
although the long term outlook for exploration and production activity is favorable based upon expected growth in worldwide energy consumption  delays in a global economic recovery could further impact activity levels on a short term basis 
additional declines in activity levels could result in lower demand for the company s products and services  and adversely impact future results 
management also believes the increasing complexity of drilling programs has resulted in a shift in exploration and production spending toward value added  technology based products  which reduce operators overall drilling costs 
the company continues to focus on investing in the development of technology based products that considerably improve the drilling process through increased efficiency and rates of penetration and reduced formation damage 
management believes the overall savings realized by the use of the company s premium products  such as polycrystalline diamond drill bits  diamond enhanced three cone drill bits and synthetic drilling fluids  compensate for the higher costs of these products over their non premium counterparts

revenue increases were reported in all geographic regions  with the majority of the growth concentrated in north america where demand for drill bits was favorably impacted by higher natural gas and crude oil prices 
smith services manufactures and markets products and services used in the oil and gas industry for drilling  workover  well completion and well re entry 
smith services revenues rose million  or percent  from to million in the impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of essentially offset the effect of the divestiture of the directional operations in january the significant organic revenue growth is attributable to higher worldwide activity levels and new contract awards 
smith services base revenues increased over levels in all geographic regions  with approximately two thirds of the improvement reported in the united states

the improvement in operating margins was equally split between increased gross profit margins and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
the gross profit margins were impacted by higher sales and production volumes and  to a lesser extent  price increases implemented during distribution segment revenues wilson markets pipe  valves  fittings  mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the united states and canada 
wilson s revenues totaled billion in  an increase of million  or percent  from the van leeuwen operations  acquired in early  contributed approximately two thirds of the revenue growth year over year 
the majority of the eight percent increase in base business revenues was reported in the us energy branch operations  which benefited from higher customer spending on exploration and production programs and line pipe projects 
for the year ended december   wilson s revenues increased million  or percent  from due to a combination of internal growth and the impact of acquisitions 
excluding the impact of acquired operations  revenues grew percent over the prior year period as the increase in us exploration and production activity had a favorable impact on energy sector revenues 
income before interest and taxes wilson s income before interest and taxes of million was million  or percent  above the level reported in income before interest and taxes approximated percent of revenue in  slightly above the level due to the impact of the revenue growth on coverage of sales and administrative support expenses 
gross profit margins were consistent with the prior year with an improvement in gross margins in the us energy branches offset by the effect of a higher proportion of industrial and downstream revenues  which traditionally generate lower gross profit margins 
for the year ended december   wilson s income before interest and taxes increased million from the previous year 
as a percentage of revenue  income before interest and taxes increased to percent in from a breakeven level in higher revenues and a favorable shift in product mix accounted for the majority of this improvement

two thirds of the improvement was generated by the company s base operations 
the company reported organic revenue growth of percent from  comparing favorably to the percent increase in average worldwide drilling activity 
the majority of the consolidated base revenue growth was reported in the united states and europe africa 
the period to period increase in revenues was also attributable to acquired operations and  to a lesser extent  the impact of improved pricing and market penetration experienced in the company s oilfield operations 
gross profit increased million  or percent  from due primarily to the higher reported revenue levels 
gross profit margins rose over two percentage points to percent of revenues in  reflecting the impact of price increases and higher sales volumes on fixed cost coverage in the oilfield products and services segment 
a higher proportion of oilfield revenues in  which generally generate higher gross profit margins than the distribution business  also favorably affected the overall percentage 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million  or percent  from the amount reported in the majority of the overall increase in operating expenses is attributable to the expansion in base business volumes  which contributed to a percent increase in average personnel levels over incremental operating expenses associated with acquired operations contributed to the higher expense levels  to a lesser extent  accounting for approximately percent of the variance from the prior year

minority interests in was million  an increase of million from reflecting primarily the improvement in profitability of the m i joint venture 
versus total revenues for increased million  or percent  above the prior year as higher demand for oil and gas and  corresponding  higher commodity prices contributed to a percent increase in worldwide drilling activity 
the year over year improvement was also attributable to incremental revenues from acquired distribution operations and  to a lesser extent  the impact of price increases implemented throughout the year 
excluding the effect of acquired and divested operations  revenues grew percent above the prior year levels with improvement reported across all operating units and geographic areas 
approximately two thirds of the base business growth was generated in north america  resulting from a percent improvement in the average number of rigs drilling for oil and natural gas 
gross profit increased million  or percent  from the fiscal year 
period to period  gross profit margins improved one percentage point reflecting the impact of higher sales volumes on fixed cost coverage  increased absorption in the company s manufacturing operations and price increases implemented during the year 
gross profit margins increased in both the oilfield and the distribution segments  however  the higher proportion of distribution revenues  which traditionally generate lower profit margins than the oilfield businesses  impacted the overall percentage 
operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million from the amount reported in the majority of the increase in operating expenses resulted from incremental costs of the acquired operations and the impact of higher profitability levels  which resulted in increased profit sharing and incentive accruals 
increased operating expenses associated with higher volumes  primarily personnel additions and other variable costs  also contributed to the period to period increase 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined two percentage points from the prior year reflecting higher fixed cost coverage related to the overall sales and administrative functions 
net interest expense  which represents interest expense less interest income  decreased million from the prior year 
in  the company utilized proceeds from the sale of an interest in m i to repay outstanding indebtedness  resulting in the reported decline 
the reduction was partially offset by increased borrowings in to finance acquisitions and general working capital needs  which increased as a result of the revenue growth experienced by the company 
the effective tax rate for approximated percent  which was a decrease from the percent effective rate reported in and lower than the us statutory rate 
the effective tax rate in was below the us statutory rate due to the impact of m i s us partnership earnings for which the minority partner is directly responsible for its related income taxes 
the effective tax rate was below the prior year rate due primarily to the impact in of non deductible costs associated with the sale of a minority ownership interest in m i 
minority interests reflect the portion of the results of majority owned operations which are applicable to the minority interest partners 
minority interests increased million from the prior year due to the higher profitability level of the m i operations and  to a lesser extent  the period of time the operations were owned jointly with a minority partner 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   cash and cash equivalents equaled million 
during  the company s operations generated million of cash flows  which is million above the amount reported in the improvement is related to the significant increase in profitability levels experienced by the company and  to a lesser extent  lower investment in working capital  particularly accounts receivable 
in  cash flows used in investing activities totaled million  primarily attributable to amounts required to fund acquisitions as well as the company s capital expenditure needs 
during  the company invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds arising from certain asset disposals 
projected net capital expenditures for are expected to decline to approximately million  as reduced drilling activity is expected to impact the level of investment in manufacturing and rental tool equipment 
capital spending in is expected to primarily consist of spending for routine additions of property and equipment to support the company s operations and maintenance of the company s capital equipment base 
additionally  the company completed acquisitions during in exchange for cash consideration of million 
management continues to evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to the company s operations 
these acquisitions  if they arise  may involve the use of cash or  depending upon the size and terms of the acquisition  may require debt or equity financing 
cash flows required to fund investing activities exceeded cash flows from operations  resulting in incremental borrowings of million under new credit facilities 
the incremental cash requirements of the company were funded with proceeds from a million public debt offering and a million floating rate note offering 
proceeds from the offerings were also used to reduce short term borrowings as well as amounts outstanding under revolving credit agreements 
the company s primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
cash flow generated by operations is primarily influenced by the level of worldwide drilling activity  which affects profitability levels and working capital requirements 
capacity under revolving credit agreements is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
the company has various revolving credit facilities in the united states 
as of december   the company had million of funds available under these facilities for future operating or investing needs

the company s external sources of liquidity include debt and equity financing in the public capital markets  if needed 
the company carries an investment grade credit rating with recognized rating agencies  generally providing the company with access to debt markets 
the company s overall borrowing capacity is  in part  dependent on maintaining compliance with financial covenants under the various credit agreements 
as of year end  the company was well within the covenant compliance thresholds under its various loan indentures  as amended  providing the ability to access available borrowing capacity 
management believes funds generated by operations  amounts available under existing credit facilities and external sources of liquidity will be sufficient to finance capital expenditures and working capital needs of the existing operations for the foreseeable future 
the company has not engaged in off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities and the consolidation of the company s minority ownership positions would not result in an increase in reported leverage ratios 
the company has no contractual arrangements in place that could result in the issuance of additional shares of the company s common stock at a future date other than the company s stock option program  which is discussed in note  employee stock options 
the company believes that it has sufficient existing manufacturing capacity to meet current demand for its products and services 
additionally  inflation has not had a material effect on the company in recent years  and is expected to have a modest impact on the operations in the foreseeable future 
the company has generally been able to offset most of the effects of inflation through productivity gains  cost reductions and price increases 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes the company s debt maturities and future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year in thousands debt operating lease period due maturities commitments total thereafter    from time to time  the company issues standby letters of credit and bid and performance bonds 
at december   the company had million of these instruments outstanding  primarily performance bonds  of which million expire in management does not expect any material amounts to be drawn on these instruments 
the company routinely establishes and reviews the adequacy of reserves for estimated future environmental clean up costs for properties currently or previously operated by the company 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with environmental protection laws  estimating the costs of compliance with these regulations is difficult considering the continual changes in environmental legislation 
in connection with most business acquisitions  the company obtains contractual indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
these indemnifications generally provide for the reimbursement of environmental clean up costs incurred by the company for events occurring or circumstances existing prior to the purchase date  whether the event or circumstance was known or unknown at that time 
a substantial portion of the company s total environmental exposure is associated with its m i operations  which are subject to various indemnifications from former owners 
while actual future environmental costs may differ from estimated liabilities recorded at december   the company does not believe that these differences will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  subject to the indemnifications in place 
in the unlikely event that the parties providing indemnifications do not fulfill their obligations  such event could result in the recognition of up to million in additional environmental exposure  impacting earnings and cash flows in future periods 
subsequent to december   the argentine government issued a decree that eliminated the us dollar as argentina s monetary benchmark and converted us dollar denominated obligations to peso denominated obligations using mandated conversion rates 
the company s operations in argentina are us dollar functional  with the majority of sales to customers invoiced in us dollars 
while the company does not anticipate that this event will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations  there can be no assurance that economic conditions in argentina will not worsen  which could impact future earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables  and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
the company records liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
management s estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  the company generally obtains indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for the company beginning january  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business of accounting principles board opinion no 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb released sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is required to be adopted by the company no later than january  sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for retirement obligations and costs associated with tangible long lived assets 
the company is currently reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the standard s impact  if any  on its financial statements upon adoption 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in july which addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and some intangibles will no longer be amortized to earnings but will be tested for impairment 
while most provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the company beginning january   goodwill and intangible assets acquired subsequent to june  were subject immediately to the provisions of the statement 
the adoption of sfas no 
will result in the elimination of million of goodwill amortization recognized in fiscal  or million net of taxes and minority interests  with no other material impact anticipated on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
qualitative and quantitative market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of december  the fair value of interest rate contracts as of december  was not material 
at december   percent of the company s long term debt carried a variable interest rate 
management believes that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
