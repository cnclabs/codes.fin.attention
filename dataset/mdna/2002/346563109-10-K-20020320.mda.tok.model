item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading independent emerging technology research firm that conducts research and analysis on the impact of emerging technologies on business  consumers  and society 
we provide our clients with an integrated perspective on technology and business  which we call the wholeview 
our approach provides companies with the strategies  data  and product evaluations they need to evolve their business models and infrastructure to embrace broader on line markets and to scale their operations 
we help our clients develop business strategies that use technology to win customers  identify new markets  and gain competitive operational advantages 
our products and services primarily benefit the senior management  business strategists  and marketing and technology professionals at global  companies who use our prescriptive  actionable research to understand and capitalize on business models and emerging technologies 
we derive revenues from memberships to our core research and from our advisory services and forum and summit events 
we offer contracts for our products and services that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
research revenues are recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the contract 
our advisory services clients purchase such services together with memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when performed 
similarly  forum and summit billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized upon completion of each event 
our operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and they include the costs of salaries  bonuses  and related benefits for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions 
we believe that the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services provides a significant measure of our business volume 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
agreement value decreased to million at december  from million at december  agreement value increased at december  from million at december  no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  our historical experience is that a substantial portion of client companies renew expiring contracts for an equal or higher level of total research and advisory service fees each year 
approximately   and of our client companies with memberships expiring during the years ended december    and  respectively  renewed one or more memberships for our products and services 
these renewal rates are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
the declines in agreement value and renewal rates in are reflective of the more difficult economic environment and may lead to a decrease in revenue for on july   we announced a sales force reorganization and general work force reduction in response to conditions and demands of the market and a slower economy 
as a result  we reduced our work force by positions  closed sales offices in atlanta  los angeles  melbourne  new york  and zurich  and recorded a reorganization charge of approximately million in the quarter ended september  approximately of the terminated employees had been members of the sales force  while and had held research and administrative roles  respectively 
this charge consisted primarily of severance and related expenses from the work force reduction 
this charge also included office consolidation costs  such as contractual lease commitments for space that was vacated  the write off of related leasehold improvements  and other payments for professional services incurred in connection with the reorganization 
additional depreciable assets that were written off include computer equipment  software  and furniture and fixtures related to employees and locations terminated in connection with the reorganization 
reorganization costs as of december  are as follows in thousands accrued as of total non cash cash december  charge charges payments workforce reduction   facility consolidations and other related costs depreciable assets total   a significant portion of the remaining liabilities accrued as of december  are expected to be paid out in the three months ended march  on january   in response to conditions and demands of the market and a slower economy  we announced the reduction of our work force by approximately positions and expect to record a reorganization charge of approximately million to million in the quarter ended march  this charge will consist primarily of severance and related expenses from the reduction of the work force  including office consolidations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generally invoice our core research  advisory  and other services when orders are received 
the contract amount is recorded as accounts receivable and deferred revenue when the client is invoiced 
core research is generally recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory and other services are recognized during the period in which the services are performed 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
as of december   deferred revenues and deferred commissions totaled million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments that totaled approximately  as of december  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in companies and equity investment funds that totaled approximately million as of december  we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we recorded impairment charges that totaled approximately million in and million in future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisition of our research centre deutschland in frankfurt  germany  that totaled approximately million as of december  we periodically evaluate this acquired business for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance 
as of december   we believe that the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets is not impaired 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired business are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we expect to adopt statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
in the quarter ending march  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that there may be an impairment 
the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
makes it impracticable to reasonably estimate the financial statement impact  specifically whether there will be any transitional impairment losses realized as a cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill and assembled workforce was approximately  in and  in amortization expense related to other identifiable intangible assets that will continue to be amortized in the future was approximately  in and  in results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  core research advisory services and other total revenues cost of services and fulfillment selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization reorganization costs costs related to acquisition income from operations other income  net income before income tax provision provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and december  revenues

results of quarterly operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
we have derived this information from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  which  in the opinion of our management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  our total revenues  operating profit  and net income in the fourth quarter have reflected the significant positive contribution of revenues attributable to advisory services performed and forum events held in the fourth quarter 
as a result  we have historically experienced a decline in total revenues  operating profit  and net income from the quarter ended december to the quarter ended march our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations

in addition  we received million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in february  as well as million and million in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan during and  respectively 
memberships for core research  which constituted approximately of our revenues during  are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance 
we generated cash from operating activities of million in and million in this decline in cash from operations is primarily the result of the decrease in agreement value to million at december  from million at december   and is reflected in lower accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of december  the decline is also attributable to fewer exercises of employee stock options resulting in reduced tax benefits to us 
these declines in key business metrics are reflective of the more difficult economic environment 
included in cash from operations are deferred tax benefits of million in and million in  which resulted primarily from stock option exercises 
these exercises have generated a cumulative tax deduction of approximately million for us 
approximately million of this tax deduction will eliminate current year taxable income  while million was used to eliminate taxable income for and carried back to obtain a refund of certain taxes paid in prior years 
the remaining million of this tax deduction will be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
the offset of these deferred tax benefits have been recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity 
during  we used million of cash in investing activities  consisting of million for purchases of property and equipment and million for net purchases of marketable securities and other non marketable investments 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in marketable securities 
we do not have a line of credit and do not anticipate the need for one in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and to invest in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable securities  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
in june  we committed to invest million in two private equity investment funds over a period of up to five years 
we have adopted a cash bonus plan to pay bonuses  after the return of invested capital  measured by the proceeds of a portion of the share of net profits from these investments  if any  to certain key employees  subject to the terms and conditions of the plan 
the payment of such bonuses would result in compensation expense with respect to the amounts so paid 
as of december   we had contributed approximately million to the funds 
subsequent to december   we contributed an additional million 
the timing and amount of future contributions are entirely within the discretion of the investment funds 
as of december   we had recorded total write downs to the private equity funds of  as a result of the impairment of certain investments within the funds 
the timing of the recognition of future gains or losses from the investment funds is beyond our control 
as a result  it is not possible to predict when we will recognize such gains or losses  if we will award cash bonuses based on the net profit from such investments  or when we will incur compensation expense in connection with the payment of such bonuses 
if the investment funds realize large gains or losses on their investments  we could experience significant variations in our quarterly results unrelated to our business operations 
these variations could be due to significant gains or losses or to significant compensation expenses 
while gains may offset compensation expenses in a particular quarter  there can be no assurance that related gains and compensation expenses will occur in the same quarter 
as of december   we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total      we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements

during and  we recognized revenues of approximately  and  respectively  related to a partners program purchased by one of the private equity investment firms 
the remaining revenues will be recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy through the termination date of the contract in march we believe that the services sold to the private equity investment firm were at arm s length fair market value 
during  and  we purchased survey services and data from companies in which we held a minority interest that totaled approximately   and  respectively 
we believe that the services received were at arm s length fair market value 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method 
sfas no 
also specifies criteria that acquired intangible assets must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in connection with the sfas no 
transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  we are required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of income 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for companies with fiscal years beginning after march  although we expect to adopt sfas no 
in the fiscal quarter ended march   the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting the statement makes it impracticable to reasonably estimate the financial statement impact  specifically whether there will be any transitional impairment losses realized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets of million 
amortization expense related to goodwill and assembled workforce was approximately  for and  for amortization expense related to other identifiable intangible assets that will continue to be amortized in the future was approximately  for and  for in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under this statement  it is required that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal and state government obligations and corporate obligations  with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars dollars in thousands fair value at year ending year ending year ending year ending year ending december  december  december  december  december  december  cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate investments       weighted average interest rate total portfolio       weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure had been related to non us dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  canada  and asia  where we sell primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union has not  to date  had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets related to non us dollar denominated currencies was approximately million
