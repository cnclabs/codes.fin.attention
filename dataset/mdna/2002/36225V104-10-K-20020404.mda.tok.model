management discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include contract revenue and cost recognition  valuation of accounts receivables  impairment of long lived and intangible assets and income tax recognition of deferred tax items which are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
contract revenue and cost recognition 
the company provides services under time and materials  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts 
under time and material and certain costs plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts under which costs are generally incurred in proportion with contracted billing schedules  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes estimated fees at predetermined rates when the customer may be billed 
such method is expected to result in reasonably consistent profit margins over the contract term 
for certain cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts  the company follows the guidance contained in aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that contain enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the contracting parties  consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement  assuming reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and expenses can be made 
the percentage of completion methodology generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract 
amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 
differences between recorded costs and estimated earnings and final billings are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current asset 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings or uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current liability 
generally contracts provide for the billing of costs incurred and estimated earnings on a monthly basis 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
if sufficient risk exists  a zero profit methodology is applied to a specific client contract s percentage of completion model whereby the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of costs incurred until such time as the risks have been partially or wholly mitigated through performance 
our estimates of revenues and expenses on client contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
in addition  the implementation of cost saving initiatives and achievement of productivity gains generally results in a reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
for all client contracts  provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first become apparent 
there is no certainty that events beyond anyone s control such as economic downturns or significant prolonged decreases in performance improvement services could occur 
valuation of accounts receivables provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for specific credit risks 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of the company s historical loss experience  judgments about customer credit risk  and the need to adjust for current economic conditions 
impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets result in a charge to operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived tangible assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by determining the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the measurement of the future net cash flows to be generated is subject to management s reasonable expectations with respect to the company s future operations and future economic conditions which may affect those cash flows 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the amount of related intangible assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired entities 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
the assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
the company will adopt sfas in which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment review 
long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with definite lives will be subject to impairment under sfas no 
income tax recognition the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
restructuring reserves the company adopted restructuring plans  primarily related to its open enrollment it business  in and in order to identify and calculate the associated costs to exit this business  management makes assumptions regarding estimates of future liabilities for operating leases and other contractual obligations  severance costs and the net realizable value of assets 
management believes its estimates  which are reviewed quarterly  to be reasonable and considers its knowledge of the industry  its previous experience in exiting activities and valuations from independent third parties if necessary  in calculation of such estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
as of the date of adoption  the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of approximately  both of which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while statement no 
supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
statement no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  the fasb has enhanced management s ability to provide information that helps financial statement users to assess the effects of a disposal transaction on the ongoing operations of an entity 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs internal processes to manage its exposure to interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
the company s objective in managing its interest rate risk is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company is exposed to the impact of currency fluctuations because of its international operations 
as of december   the company had approximately  of variable rate borrowings 
the company estimates that for every fluctuation in general interest rates  assuming debt levels at december   interest expense would vary by  the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries  including intercompany balances  at december   was in a net asset position with respect to such subsidiaries of approximately  as a result of restructurings over the past two years and accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency do not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
the forward looking statements contained herein reflect the company s management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  including  but not limited to those risks and uncertainties detailed in the company s periodic reports and registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission
