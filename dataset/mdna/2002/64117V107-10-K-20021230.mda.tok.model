overview we develop  market and sell a broad family of integrated network security solutions for enterprises  carriers and government entities 
our security solutions provide key technologies such as firewall  virtual private networking  denial of service and intrusion detection and prevention in a line of easy to manage security systems and appliances 
our firewall and vpn systems and appliances deliver integrated firewall  virtual private networking and denial of service capabilities in single device using our proprietary application specific integrated circuits  which we refer to as gigascreen and gigascreen ii asics  and our proprietary security operating system  screenos 
our intrusion detection and prevention appliances run a secure version of the linux operating system and use proprietary software and multiple detection methods to identify network attacks 
our products are based on industry standard communication protocols and can be combined with our management software so that they can be easily integrated into networks  easily managed and will interoperate with other security devices and applications 
on september   we completed our acquisition of onesecure  inc  a provider of network intrusion detection and prevention solutions 
we issued million shares of our common stock for all the outstanding stock of onesecure 
we also assumed all of the outstanding stock options of onesecure  which were converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock  and issued options to purchase million shares of our common stock in connection with the transaction 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the total purchase price of million has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
onesecure s results of operations have been included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million and other intangible assets of 
table of contents million 
in accordance with provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill resulting from the acquisition will not be amortized  but will be reviewed periodically for impairment 
the other intangible assets will be amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether the operations  products and technology of onesecure can be integrated with our operations  products and technology in a timely and cost effective manner 
the process of combining the two companies is a complex  expensive and time consuming process and may cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the development and sales activities and operations of both companies 
we cannot assure you that any part or all of the integration will be accomplished on a timely basis  or at all 
we introduced and began shipping several new products since the end of our last fiscal year  which are as follows product first shipment netscreen november netscreen november netscreen january netscreen january netscreen april netscreen remote august netscreen october netscreen idp september netscreen idp november the revenue and income potential of our newest products is unproven and the markets addressed by these products are volatile 
likewise  we may not be able to effectively combine onesecure s technologies into our own products  successfully market or enhance onesecure s line of intrusion detection and prevention products  or offer a viable combined hardware or management product that addresses the needs of our customers 
as a result of this limited history  it may be difficult to plan operating expenses or forecast our revenues accurately 
if our newer products are not successful  our operating results could be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from outside the americas 
revenues from outside the americas were in the year ended september   compared to in the year ended september  and in the year ended september  specifically  revenues from asia and the pacific rim apac accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in the years ended september   and  respectively 
revenues from europe  the middle east and africa emea accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in the years ended september   and  respectively 
the increases in revenues from outside the americas as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to increasing demand for our products in international markets as we continued to expand our presence around the world 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase the demand for our products in international markets 
we derive revenues primarily from sales of our hardware based security systems and appliances and maintenance arrangements  and  to a lesser extent  from sales of software products and services 
we have incurred significant losses in each fiscal period since our inception and  as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we experienced consecutive improvements in revenues and net loss before deemed dividend in each quarter of fiscal in the first through fourth quarters of fiscal  our revenues were million  million  million and million  and our net loss before deemed dividend was million  million  million and approximately  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our revenues will continue to grow at the same rate as in the past  at the rate expected or that we will achieve similar results in future periods 
there can also be no assurance that our net loss will continue to decline or that we will reach or maintain profitability in future periods 

table of contents we recorded a deemed dividend of million in the year ended september  related to our october issuance of series f preferred stock at a price subsequently deemed to be below its fair value 
the deemed dividend was calculated based on the difference between the assumed fair market value at the time of our ipo and the purchase price of the series f preferred stock 
we also recorded deemed dividends of million  million and approximately  in the years ended september   and  respectively  to account for cumulative dividend rights attributable to our series e and f preferred stock 
at the time of our ipo  all outstanding preferred stock converted to common stock and all dividend rights  as well as voting and liquidation rights  attributable to the preferred stock terminated 
cost of product revenues consists of the costs associated with manufacturing  assembling and testing our products  related overhead costs  compensation and other costs related to manufacturing support and logistics 
we rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our hardware products 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of product revenues consists of payments to these contract manufacturers 
cost of maintenance and service revenues consists of customer support costs  training and professional service expenses and warranty related costs 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products  maintenance and services  new product introductions and enhancements  the cost of components and manufacturing labor  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component shortages  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
our gross margin will be adversely affected by price declines if we are unable to reduce costs on existing products and do not continue to introduce new products with higher margins 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for development and engineering personnel  fees paid to consultants  license fees paid to third parties and prototype costs related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our asics  security systems and appliances  screenos  management applications and vpn client software 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of new products 
to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
as a result  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and sales support functions and costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities 
we intend to expand our sales operations substantially  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase sales of our products 
in addition  we believe part of our future success will be dependent upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of additional resellers in other countries 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales efforts in additional domestic and international locations  hire additional sales and marketing personnel and initiate additional marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  legal and human resources personnel  professional fees and corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we employ additional personnel  and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and our operation as a public company  including new corporate governance requirements 
we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
expenses associated with stock based compensation are being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the individual awards consistent with the method described in fasb interpretation no 
during the years ended 
table of contents september   and  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million  million and million  respectively  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of the common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
we also recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately  representing the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of onesecure 
restricted stock acquired through the exercise of unvested stock options is subject to our right to repurchase the unvested stock at the price paid  which right lapses over time 
deferred stock compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the individual award  generally four years  consistent with the method described in fasb interpretation no 
during the years ended september   and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and million  respectively 
this deferred stock compensation expense relates to stock options granted to individuals in all cost of revenues and operating expense categories  and has been included in those categories 
at september   million of deferred stock compensation related to employee stock options remained unamortized 
this amount will be amortized as follows in thousands year ending september total deferred stock compensation the provision for income taxes is primarily related to federal income taxes and income taxes generated on income in tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of technical complexity and market acceptance of technically complex products  which impact revenue recognition  deferral of revenue for distributors and value added resellers and revenue reserves  which impact revenue recognition  potential return rates and probability of collections  which impact account receivable and warranty reserves  the valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill and identified intangible assets  and  the assessment of our realization of deferred tax assets  which impacts income taxes 
revenue recognition general we derive our revenues primarily from sales of our hardware based security systems and appliances and maintenance arrangements  and  to a lesser extent  from sales of software products and services 
we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we defer a portion of product revenues based on the value of basic maintenance services bundled with each product sale 
for these bundled arrangements  revenue is allocated among each element of the bundle at the time of sale based on the fair value of each element of the bundle 
the fair value of each element is determined by reference to the prices we charge when each element is sold separately 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
we also derive a portion of our revenues from sales of separate extended maintenance arrangements 

table of contents for newly introduced technically complex products  we defer recognition of revenues from the sale of these products until they have successfully performed in the marketplace and sales returns are not unusually high 
determining which products are sufficiently technically complex to merit this revenue deferral requires us to exercise judgment  as does the determination of when products have achieved sufficient acceptance in the market so that deferral is no longer appropriate 
the determination of which products are complex  and the timing of the end of deferral for particular products  can be expected to vary 
if we define technically complex products too broadly  we will defer revenue unnecessarily  if we define these products too narrowly  revenue will be recognized earlier but product returns and warranty claims will be higher in future periods 
revenue recognition distributors and value added resellers we sell to value added resellers and distributors 
we derived approximately of our total revenues from value added resellers and distributors in the year ended september  we defer revenue on sales to our distributors until the distributor has sold our products to its customers 
our agreements with distributors provide for limited stock rotation and price protection rights 
stock rotation rights provide distributors with the right to exchange unsold inventory for alternate products of equal or greater value 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to credit on future purchases in the event of decreases in the prices of our products 
our agreements with value added resellers typically do not include stock rotation or price protection rights 
at the time of shipment to value added resellers  we reserve for estimated returns and exchanges 
these revenue reserves are estimated and adjusted periodically based on historical rates of returns and allowances  inventory levels for value added resellers that submit inventory or sell through reports  the volume of sales to value added resellers that we ship directly to end customers  and for sales to value added resellers that do not submit inventory or sell through reports  accounts receivable balances  payment history and other related factors 
these reserves require the exercise of our judgment in determining if historical experience applies to new products  and to new distributors and value added resellers 
if our estimate of returns and exchanges is too low  additional charges will be incurred in future periods  and these additional charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
sales return and warranty reserves we record sales return and warranty reserves based on estimates of expected future returns and allowances and expected future repair and replacement costs 
we record a sales return reserve that approximates the aggregate amount of expected future returns and allowances 
our sales return reserve is based on past return history  product mix  channel mix and  in some cases  allowances for specific customers based on several factors such as return rights included in our agreements with customers 
our warranty reserve approximates the aggregate amount of future repair and replacement costs for our products 
our warranty reserve is based on historical product repair and replacement information 
in the event we determine that our current or future sales returns and allowances and product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a large  diversified customer base  which includes customers located in foreign countries 
we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers but have experienced losses related to our accounts receivable in the past 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past history  current economic conditions and the composition of our accounts receivable aging and  in some cases  make allowances for specific customers based on several factors  such as the creditworthiness of those customers and payment history 
these allowances require our subjective judgment 
actual write offs may differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts  and this difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
inventory given the volatility of the networking market  the rapid obsolescence of technology and short product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value based on backlog and forecasted demand 
however  
table of contents backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets we review property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
our review of goodwill and other intangible assets is based on the estimated future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
our review is based on our best estimate of a variety of factors  including future market growth  forecasted revenues and costs and a strategic review of our business and operations 
in the event we determine that an asset is impaired in the future  an adjustment to the value of the asset would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies in determining the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease the net loss or increase net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
results of operations for the years ended september  and revenues product revenues 
revenues from sales of our products increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase was attributable to a higher volume of product shipments that were recognized as revenue during the year as well as an increase in the amount of deferred revenue recognized from sales to our customers 
increased product shipments consisted primarily of new products  and reflected generally higher selling prices 
hardware revenue units increased to approximately  units in the year ended september  from approximately  units in the year ended september  no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in either year 
maintenance and service revenues 
revenues from maintenance and services increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase was a result of the higher volume of products shipped and the related recognition of revenues associated with the portion of product revenues attributable to maintenance and services over the applicable maintenance period  as well as increased maintenance renewals on a larger installed base of customers 
there can be no assurance that our revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars or at the rate at which they have grown in recent periods

cost of product revenues  including stock compensation  increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  excluding stock based compensation of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively  and amortization of intangible assets of approximately  in the year ended september  
table of contents  cost of product revenues increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase  excluding stock based compensation  was related primarily to the increase in our revenues and  to a lesser extent  write downs taken against our inventories 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in the prices at which we purchase our products from our manufacturers 
product gross margin 
product gross margin  excluding stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets  as a percentage of total revenues was in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increased sales of our higher margin  mid range products and increased sales  along with improved margins  of our low range products 
we expect our product gross margin percentage to decline over time 
maintenance and service cost of revenues 
maintenance and service cost of revenues  including stock based compensation  increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  excluding stock based compensation of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively  cost of maintenance and service revenues increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  this increase  excluding stock based compensation  was primarily related to increases in costs related to the expansion of our customer support infrastructure and larger installed base of products for which we provide service 
maintenance and service gross margin 
maintenance and service gross margin  excluding stock based compensation  as a percentage of total revenues was in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to increased costs as we expanded our worldwide customer support infrastructure in order to grow that business 
we expect our service and maintenance gross margin percentage to continue to decline over time 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  including stock based compensation  increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  excluding stock based compensation of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively  research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  these expenses  excluding stock based compensation  represented and of total revenues for these periods  respectively

the dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily related to the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations  including increased compensation related expenses resulting from the growth of our sales force and higher commissions expense associated with increased revenues  increased marketing related program costs and  to a lesser extent  to increases in other sales office costs associated with the expansion of our sales force 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in direct advertising expenditures 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation  increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the 
table of contents year ended september  excluding stock based compensation of million and approximately  in the years ended september  and  respectively  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  these expenses  excluding stock based compensation  represented and of total revenues for these periods  respectively 
the dollar increase was primarily related to increased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount from the expansion of our general and administrative staff and greater infrastructure requirements  including those associated with being a public company 
these increased costs were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of employee stock options in the year ended september   we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately  in connection with stock options assumed in the acquisition of onesecure  inc during the year ended september   we recorded stock based compensation expense of million 
as of september   million of deferred stock compensation remained unamortized 
this amount will be amortized through the quarter ending december  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was million in the year ended september  compared to interest and other income  net  of million in the year ended september  the increase in interest and other income was primarily a result of increased interest earned on higher average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances in the year ended september  the increased interest income was partially offset by foreign exchange losses arising from the remeasurement of our international entities financial statements into us dollars and higher interest expense in the year ended september  due to higher average levels of debt and capital lease obligation in that year 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended september   primarily related to federal income taxes and income taxes currently payable on income generated in non us tax jurisdictions for which no us tax benefit is currently recognizable 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately  for the year ended september   primarily related to income taxes currently payable on income generated in non us tax jurisdictions for which no non us benefit is currently recognizable 
we had gross deferred tax assets  net of liabilities  of million as of september  and million as of september  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to the total gross deferred tax assets as of september  and september   has been established to reflect those uncertainties 
our deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards and deferred compensation 
as of september   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code section and section and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
results of operations for the years ended september  and revenues product revenues

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars and are translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
as of september   our investment portfolio consisted of money market funds  corporate backed debt obligations  municipal bonds and us government discount notes and earned interest at an average rate of 
we place investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risks 
based on our portfolio content and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not materially affect our interest income  although there can be no assurance of this 

table of contents factors that may affect our business and future results of operations and financial condition in addition to other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because these factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements contained in this report as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
downturns in the internet infrastructure  network security and related markets may decrease our revenues and margins 
the market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader internet infrastructure  network security and related markets 
downturns in these markets may cause enterprises and carriers to delay or cancel security projects  reduce their overall or security specific information technology budgets or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
in this environment  our customers such as distributors  value added resellers and carriers may experience financial difficulty  cease operations and fail to budget or reduce budgets for the purchase of our products 
this  in turn  may lead to longer sales cycles  delays in purchase decisions  payment and collection  and may also result in price pressures  causing us to realize lower revenues  gross margins and operating margins 
in addition  general economic uncertainty caused by potential hostilities involving the united states  terrorist activities  the decline in specific markets such as the service provider market in the united states  and the general decline in the capital spending in the information technology sector make it difficult to predict changes in the purchase and network requirements of our customers and the markets we serve 
we believe that  in light of these events  some businesses may curtail or eliminate capital spending on information technology 
if capital spending in our markets declines  our revenues  gross margins and operating margins may decline and make it necessary for us to gain significant market share from our competitors in order to achieve our financial goals and achieve or maintain profitability 
competition may decrease our revenues  market share and margins 
the market for network security products is highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
competitors may gain market share and introduce new competitive products for the same markets and customers currently served by our products 
these products may have better performance  lower prices and broader acceptance than our products 
current and potential competitors in our market include the following  all of which sell worldwide or have a presence in most of the major geographical markets for their products firewall and vpn software vendors  such as check point software technologies ltd 
and symantec corporation  network equipment manufacturers  such as cisco systems  inc  lucent technologies inc  nokia corporation and nortel networks corporation  security appliance suppliers  such as sonicwall  inc  watchguard technologies  inc and symantec corporation  intrusion detection system vendors  such as internet security systems  inc  cisco systems  inc  enterasys networks  inc 
and emerging startups  computer and network component manufacturers  low cost internet hardware suppliers with products that include network security functionality  and emerging intrusion detection and other security companies that may position their systems as replacements for our products 

table of contents many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors currently combine their products with other companies networking and security products to compete with our products 
these competitors also often combine their sales and marketing efforts to compete with our products 
this competition may result in reduced prices  lower gross and operating margins and longer sales cycles for our products 
if any of our larger competitors were to commit greater technical  sales  marketing and other resources to our markets  or reduce prices for their products over a sustained period of time  our ability to successfully sell our products  increase revenue or meet our or market analysts expectations could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating the operations of onesecure or any other future acquisitions 
on september   we completed the acquisition of onesecure  inc achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend in part upon whether the operations  products and technology of onesecure can be integrated with our operations  products and technology in a timely and cost effective manner 
the process of combining two companies is complex  expensive and time consuming and may cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the development and sales activities and operations of both companies 
we cannot assure you that any part or all of the integration will be accomplished on a timely basis  or at all 
assimilating onesecure  or any other companies we may seek to acquire in the future  involves a number of other risks  including  but not limited to adverse effects on existing customer relationships  such as cancellation of orders or the loss of key customers  difficulties in integrating or an inability to retain the employees of the acquired company  difficulties in integrating the operations of the acquired company  such as information technology resources  manufacturing processes  and financial and operational data  unanticipated costs or the incurrence of unknown liabilities  the potential incompatibility of business cultures  any perceived adverse changes in business focus  entering into markets and acquiring technologies in areas in which we have little experience  potential dilution to existing stockholders if we have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  additional expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets  and an inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
in addition  the integration of certain operations following any merger will require the time and attention of our management  which may distract attention from the day to day business of the combined company 
failure to effectively accomplish the integration of the operations of the two companies could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our limited history with our newer products makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we introduced several new system and appliance products in as a result of our limited history with these products  it may be difficult to plan operating expenses or forecast our revenues accurately 
our assumptions about customer or network requirements may be wrong 
the revenue and income potential of these products is unproven 
and  the markets addressed by these products are volatile 
likewise  we may not be able to effectively combine onesecure s technologies into our own products  successfully market or enhance 
table of contents onesecure s line of idp appliances  or offer a viable combined hardware or management product that addresses the needs of our customers 
if such products are not successful  our operating results could be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline 
failure to address evolving standards in the network security industry and successfully develop and introduce new products or product enhancements would cause our revenues to decline 
the market for network security products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we expect to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to address current and evolving customer requirements and broader networking trends and vulnerabilities 
we also expect to develop products with strategic partners and incorporate third party advanced security capabilities into our products 
some of these new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex and time consuming processes 
in developing and introducing our products  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions with respect to which features  security standards and performance criteria will be required by our customers 
if we implement features  security standards and performance criteria that are different from those required by our customers  market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed  which would harm our ability to penetrate existing or new markets 
furthermore  we may not be able to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner  or at all 
any failure to develop or introduce these new products and product enhancements might cause our existing products to be less competitive  may adversely effect our ability to sell solutions to address large customer deployments and  as a consequence  our revenues may decline 
in addition  the introduction of products embodying new technologies could render our existing products obsolete  which would have a direct  adverse effect on our market share and revenues 
any failure of our future products or product enhancements to achieve market acceptance could cause our revenues to decline and our operating results to be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
any of these factors could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the primary factors that may affect revenues and operating results include the following the demand for our products  the length of our sales cycle  the timing of recognizing revenues  new product introductions by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  variations in sales channels  product costs or mix of products sold  our ability to develop  introduce and ship in a timely manner new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components  including asics  and power supplies  for our products  variations in the prices of the components we purchase  
table of contents our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products at reasonable prices at our third party manufacturers  our ability to manage our customer base and credit risk and to collect our accounts receivable  and the financial strength of our value added resellers and distributors 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
as a result  lower than anticipated revenues for any reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and  because of our rapidly growing operating expenses  could result in substantial operating losses 
due to the factors summarized above  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
also  it is likely that  in some future quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from international customers  and our failure to address the difficulties associated with marketing  selling and supporting our products outside the united states could cause our sales to decline 
revenues from outside of the americas were of our total revenues for the year ended september   of our total revenues for the year ended september  and of our total revenues for the year ended september  we expect revenues from outside of the americas will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand or international revenues from our products 
for example  general economic conditions in international markets can fluctuate and downturns in these markets could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to meet public market expectations and achieve profitability 
also  as agreements with international distributors expire  we may be unable to favorably renew our distributor agreements or make alternative arrangements with other partners 
if we are unable to maintain or increase international market demand and revenues from our products  our revenues may be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we intend to continue expanding our existing international operations and to enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we currently have limited experience in marketing and distributing our products internationally and in developing versions of our products that comply with local standards 
in addition  international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including potential foreign government regulation of our technology or unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  greater difficulty and delays in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  currency fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less price competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which could subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 

table of contents the long sales and implementation cycles for our products may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly 
an end customer s decision to purchase our products often involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
throughout the sales cycle  we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
budget constraints and the need for multiple approvals within enterprises  carriers and government entities may also delay the purchase decision 
failure to obtain the required approval for a particular project or purchase decision may delay the purchase of our products 
as a result  the sales cycle for our security systems is typically to days 
additionally  our security systems and intrusion detection and prevention products are complex systems designed for the enterprise and service provider markets 
these systems and products require us to maintain a sophisticated sales force  engage in extensive negotiations  and provide high level engineering support to complete sales 
if these systems and products are not successful with enterprise and service provider customers  our operating results will be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline 
even after making the decision to purchase our products  our end customers may not deploy our products broadly within their networks 
the timing of implementation can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the end customer  the size of the network deployment  the complexity of the end customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy our products 
end customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis 
large deployments and purchases of our security systems also require a significant outlay of capital from end customers 
if we fail to develop or maintain relationships with value added resellers or distribution partners  or if our value added resellers or distribution partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
in the year ended september   we derived approximately of our total revenues from value added resellers and distributors 
we expect our revenues to continue to depend in large part on the performance of these third party distributors and resellers 
in addition  our value added resellers and distributors may be unsuccessful in selling our products and services  may sell products and services that are competitive with ours  may devote more resources to competitive products and may cease selling our products and services altogether 
the loss of or reduction in sales to our value added resellers or distributors could materially reduce our revenues 
if we fail to develop and maintain additional relationships with these distribution partners  or if these partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
we may experience issues with our financial systems  controls and operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to sell our products and implement our business plan successfully in a volatile and growing market requires effective management and financial systems and a system of financial processes and controls 
growth is likely to place a considerable strain on our systems  processes and controls 
our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place a strain on our management systems  controls and resources 
to address these issues  we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures  and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our work force worldwide 
if we are unable to maintain an adequate level of financial processes and controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis and our business and stock price would be harmed 
our reliance on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products could cause a delay in our ability to fill orders  which might cause us to lose sales 
flash electronics  inc manufactures  assembles and tests the netscreen  netscreen  netscreen  netscreen  netscreen  netscreen idp and netscreen idp products at its fremont  california 
table of contents facility 
solectron corporation manufactures  assembles and tests the netscreen  netscreen  netscreen  netscreen and netscreen xt products at its san jose  california facility and the netscreen xp product at its facility in china 
we currently do not have a long term supply contract with either flash electronics or solectron  and we purchase from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis 
if we should fail to manage our relationship with flash electronics or solectron effectively  or if either of these manufacturers experiences delays  disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed 
the absence of dedicated capacity with flash electronics and solectron means that  with little or no notice  they could refuse to continue manufacturing some or all of our products 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
if we are required or choose to change contract manufacturers  we would lose revenues and damage our customer relationships 
our proprietary gigascreen and gigascreen ii asics  which are key to the functionality of our hardware based products  are fabricated by foundries operated by toshiba america electronic components  inc we have no long term contract with toshiba and purchase our asics on a purchase order basis 
if toshiba materially delays its supply of asics to us  or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis  our business would be harmed 
our reliance on third party manufacturers also exposes us to the following risks outside our control unexpected increases in manufacturing and repair costs  interruptions in shipments if one of our manufacturers is unable to complete production  inability to control quality of finished products  inability to control delivery schedules  unpredictability of manufacturing yields  financial strength to meet procurement and manufacturing needs  and potential lack of adequate capacity to provide all or a part of the services we require 
our reliance on single or limited sources for key components may inhibit our ability to deliver products to our customers  which would negatively impact present and future sales 
we currently purchase several key components  including semiconductors  from single or limited sources 
we carry very little inventory of some of our products and product components  and we rely on our suppliers to deliver necessary components to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner based on the forecasts we provide 
some of the semiconductors we require are very complex  and we may not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner  which could hurt our ability to deliver our products to our customers 
we also purchase power supplies from a single source and purchase other custom components from other sole or limited sources 
if we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver products to our customers  which would negatively impact present and future revenues and  in turn  seriously harm our business 
at various times  some of the key components for our products  such as flash memory  have been in short supply 
delays in receiving components would harm our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis 
in addition  because we rely on purchase orders rather than long term contracts with our suppliers  we cannot predict with certainty our ability to procure components in the longer term 
if we receive a smaller allocation of components than is necessary to manufacture products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand  customers could choose to purchase competing products 

table of contents a breach of network security could harm public perception of our products  which could cause us to lose revenues 
if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in one of our end customer s network systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
this could cause us to lose current and potential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value added resellers and distributors 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
undetected product errors or defects could result in loss of revenues  delayed market acceptance and claims against us 
we offer a warranty on all of our products  allowing the end customer to have any defective unit repaired  or to receive a replacement product for it during the warranty period 
our products may contain undetected errors or defects 
if there is a broad product failure across our customer base  we may decide to replace all affected products or we may decide to refund the purchase price for defective units 
such defects and actions may adversely affect our ability to record revenue for units 
some errors are discovered only after a product has been installed and used by end customers 
any errors discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenues and claims against us 
if we are unable to fix errors or other problems that later are identified after full deployment  in addition to the consequence described above  we could experience failure to achieve market acceptance  loss of customers  loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
if our products do not interoperate with our end customers networks  installations would be delayed or cancelled  which could significantly reduce our revenues 
our products are designed to interface with our end customers existing networks  each of which has different specifications and utilizes multiple protocol standards 
many of our end customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as with future products that might be added to these networks in order to meet our end customers requirements 
if we find errors in the existing software used in our end customers networks  we may elect to modify our software to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with their existing software and hardware 
if our products do not interoperate with those within our end customers networks  installations could be delayed or orders for our products could be cancelled  which could significantly reduce our revenues 
if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which could reduce our gross margins or cause us to lose sales 
because we currently do not have long term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers  they are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any certain price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
we provide forecasts of our demand to our contract 
table of contents manufacturers up to six months prior to scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
if we overestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have an inadequate component inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues 
in addition  lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
we may also experience shortages of components from time to time  which also could delay the manufacturing of our products 
we may experience losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in october we may incur losses in the future 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had net losses applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september  we have large fixed expenses  and we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing sales and marketing  research and development and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to continue generating higher revenues to achieve profitability 
revenue growth depends on many factors  including those described elsewhere in these factors that may affect our business and future results of operations and financial condition 
our revenues may not grow  our gross margins and operating margins may decline and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
a failure to achieve profitability or a delay in any anticipated timing to achieve profitability could cause our stock price to decline 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market  and if we are unable to hire additional personnel or retain existing personnel  our ability to execute our business strategy would be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers  including in particular robert d 
thomas  feng deng and yan ke and other key engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term  and no one is constrained from terminating his or her employment relationship with us at any time 
in addition  since a number of our long standing employees have most of their stock options or restricted stock vested  their economic incentive to remain in our employ may be diminished 
further  we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
we also intend to hire a significant number of engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel in the future  and we believe our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain these key employees 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area 
in particular  we have experienced difficulty in hiring asic  software  system and test  and customer support engineers  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining these individuals 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and negatively impact our ability to sell  our products 
we might have to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our products and services 
because our products and services provide and monitor network security and may protect valuable information  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate the confidential information or other property of end customers using our products  or interrupt their operations 
if that happens  affected end customers or others may sue us 
in addition  we may face liability for breaches caused by faulty installation of our products by our service and support organizations 
provisions in our contracts relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations may be unenforceable 
some courts  for example  have found contractual limitations of liability in standard computer and software contracts to be unenforceable in some circumstances 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  could 
table of contents be costly and could divert management attention 
our business liability insurance coverage may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  end customers or potential competitors might be able to use our technologies to develop their own solutions  which could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenues 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
as of september   we have seven patent applications pending in the united states relating to the design of our products  three of which has been extended to other countries 
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents 
even if we obtain such patents  that will not guarantee that our patent rights will be valuable  create a competitive barrier or will be free from infringement 
furthermore  if any patent is issued  it might be invalidated or circumvented or otherwise fail to provide us any meaningful protection 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control the use  access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights that could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may become a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of another party s intellectual property 
claims for alleged infringement and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following stop or delay selling  incorporating or using products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all  or redesign the products that use that technology 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  our business might be seriously harmed 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that could be imposed 
the inability to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to obtain any third party license required to develop new products or product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we will record substantial expenses related to our issuance of stock options that will have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have granted stock options under our stock option plans since november we are required to recognize  as a reduction of stockholders equity  deferred stock compensation equal to the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
this deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years  using the straight line vesting method 
at september   approximately million of deferred stock compensation related to employee stock options remained unamortized 
the resulting amortization expense will have a material negative impact on our results of operations in future periods through the quarter ending december  governmental regulations affecting the import or export of products could negatively affect our revenues 
governmental regulation of imports or exports or failure to obtain required export approval of our encryption technologies could harm our international and domestic sales 
the united states and various foreign governments have imposed controls  export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  especially encryption technology 
in addition  from time to time  governmental agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology  such as requiring the escrow and governmental recovery of private encryption keys 
in particular  in light of recent terrorist activity  governments could enact additional regulation or restrictions on the use  import or export of encryption technology 
additional regulation of encryption technology could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications 
this might decrease demand for our products and services 
in addition  some foreign competitors are subject to less stringent controls on exporting their encryption technologies 
as a result  they may be able to compete more effectively than we can in the domestic and international network security market 
earthquakes  other natural disasters and power shortages may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend 
our corporate headquarters and two of our third party manufacturers are located in northern california near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
an earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters or near one or more of the facilities of third parties upon which we rely could disrupt our operations or the operations of those parties 
none of these disruptions would be covered by insurance  so the supply of our products could be limited  our business could be hampered and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
the market prices of the securities of technology related companies have been extremely volatile 
thus  the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations 
if our revenues do not grow or grow more slowly than we anticipate  if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be reduced appropriately  or if some other event adversely affects us  the market price of our common stock could decline 
in addition  if the market for technology related stocks or the stock market in general experiences a continued or greater loss in investor confidence or otherwise fails  the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the market price of our stock also might decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us
