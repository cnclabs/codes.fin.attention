item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information of bionova holding and the consolidated financial statements and related notes of bionova holding included elsewhere in this form k 
overview for operating and financial reporting purposes  the company historically has classified its business into three fundamental areas farming  which consists principally of interests in company owned fresh produce production facilities and joint ventures or contract growing arrangements with other growers  distribution  consisting principally of interests in sales and distribution companies in mexico  the united states and canada  and research and development or technology  consisting of business units focused on the development of fruits and vegetables and or intellectual properties associated with these development efforts 
the farming and distribution segments are collectively referred to as the fresh produce business 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting and standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment upon initial adoption of the statement and on an annual basis going forward 
the amortization provisions of fas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   bionova holding is required to adopt fas effective january  we believe that adoption of these standards will have no impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal periods 
this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
and apb  however  this statement retains the requirement of opinion to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  by abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in december  in connection with its ongoing review of business operations  the company conducted a strategic and financial examination of its business segments 
this examination triggered an impairment review of certain long lived assets  including goodwill  patents and trademarks 
the company calculated the present value of expected cash flows of its fresh produce and technology businesses to determine the fair value of those assets 
accordingly  the company recorded charges of million and million for the impairment of its goodwill and patents and trademarks  respectively  related to the fresh produce and technology businesses 
the company s technology assets became impaired because of i the decision to terminate vpp s breeding program and dispose of the related assets and ii the change in dnap s technology strategy from a focus on quality trait improvements and the commercialization of fruits and vegetables using these traits to a technology program focused on disease and nematode resistance traits with value deriving from the sale or licensing of these traits 
the company s fresh produce assets were determined to have become impaired based on the future outlook for cash flows of the fresh produce business taking into account its failure to generate a positive annual cash flow in each of the past six years and an analysis of the reasons underlying this performance failure 
the various components of these impairment charges are broken out by business segment in the discussion which follows 
because the company has no goodwill remaining on its balance sheet and the reduction in the book value of the patents and trademarks of dnap and vpp  the company s amortization expense in future years will decline to million per year as compared with the million expense recorded in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated total revenues declined to million for the year ended december  from million in  consolidated gross profit sales less cost of sales increased from million in to million in  and the company s consolidated operating loss increased from million in to million in farming segment revenues  the majority of which are eliminated in consolidation  for the year ended december  were million as compared with million during farming segment gross profit improved from a loss of million in to a profit of million in the operating loss in this segment increased from million in to million in improved weather and significantly better market pricing were the most important factors in the improved production and sales from culiacan during the first quarter of as compared with the same quarter in production volumes in this region increased by and sales improved by  or million 
in conjunction with the company s strategy to better manage its risk of production  absa significantly curtailed its own production of commodity products in favor of establishing production contracts with third party growers who then shipped their product to be packaged by absa and distributed by the company s distribution operations 
absa s production on its own land is now concentrated on higher value products eg  mini sweet peppers and full flavor tomatoes for which the company holds proprietary rights or has some other form of competitive advantage in production 
other significant components of the overall improvement in absa s sales were the addition of acres of production from obregon  which accounted for million in incremental sales between and  and incremental grape sales of million  which had been down significantly in due to an onslaught of chilean grapes exported to the us markets during that year 
the improvement in gross margin stemmed directly from the improved sales 
still  the gross margin at of sales in was far less than the company has been forecasting it would achieve from this segment of the business 
the company expects gross margins to improve if it is able to continue to increase its sales of the higher value products for which it obtains better prices and margins  and on which it is now concentrating an ever increasing proportion of its resources 
the increase in absa s operating loss from to was a consequence of the million write off of goodwill taken at year end this goodwill emanated from bionova mexico s purchase of of absa in which was contributed to bionova holding in and increased when bionova holding  together with savia  bought out all of the remaining minority interests in absa that had been held by the batiz family in revenues of the distribution segment declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  distribution segment gross profit increased from million in to million in  while the operating loss for this segment increased from million in to million in the revenue decline was a consequence of the sale of taminura distributing inc in february which had sales of million in none were recorded for tdi in due to the provisions of the contract of sale and interfruver  in november  which sold million more on behalf of the company in as compared with the january through october period of these declines were offset in part by million in higher revenues of the us and canadian distribution companies in as compared with  which was attributable to higher average prices for the company s fresh produce products in these markets in the increase in the operating loss from to was directly attributable to the million charge recorded to write off all of the goodwill in this segment of the business and million of losses incurred on the sale of the tdi and interfruver businesses in these charges were offset in part by a significantly reduced level of write offs of grower financed production  higher volumes  and the better pricing environment in as compared with research and development revenues declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and the operating loss in this segment increased from million in to million in the decline in revenues was attributable to a lower level of activity performed with seminis 
seminis contract revenues on a monthly basis were reduced by in conjunction with the staff reductions undertaken during the second quarter of to conserve cash resources and refocus the technology group on more promising long term technology opportunities 
research work on behalf of seminis was charged at direct costs of scientists working on the projects plus an allocation of overhead  and accordingly  generated very little profit for dnap 
this reduction in the revenues arising from the seminis contract is expected to continue through  such that the revenues for the full year will be lower than the staffing reductions resulted in a positive million impact on the bottom line  as the million restructuring expenses generated a million savings in compensation related costs in as compared with the higher operating loss in as compared with was a consequence of the write offs of goodwill and patents and trademarks in the write off of goodwill amounted to million at dnap 
losses on the sale of strawberry assets associated with the discontinuation of vpp s breeding business totaled million  and impairment losses of the patents and trademarks of dnap resulted in a write off of million 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in due to significant staffing reductions in both the fresh produce and research and development segments undertaken over this two year period 
the non cash charge for amortization of goodwill  patents and trademarks decreased by million in as compared with due to the re classification of the company s strawberry breeding assets as assets held for sale in the third quarter of and their subsequent sale prior to year end 
interest expense declined from million in to million in due to the lower average level of debt outstanding in as compared with the lower level of debt came about due to the capitalization of million of the company s debt completed on december  interest income increased by million from to due primarily to a higher level of cash advances to growers in as compared with due to a decline in the current monetary assets which excludes inventories and an increase in non monetary assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries in  the company experienced a net foreign exchange loss of million in as compared with a net foreign exchange gain of million in current monetary assets are translated at year end exchange rates while non monetary assets are translated at historical rates 
while both the mexican peso and canadian dollar strengthened in  the decline in monetary assets and the increase in non monetary assets more than offset the improvement in the exchange rates of these foreign currencies 
for  the share of profits in subsidiaries allocable to minority interests was million as compared with million that was the share of losses in subsidiaries allocable to minority interests in these allocations of losses for the years of and  respectively  were consistent with the minority positions held across the operating subsidiaries of the company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated total revenues declined to million for the year ended december  from million in  consolidated gross profit sales less cost of sales increased from million in to million in  and the company s consolidated operating loss decreased from million in to million in farming segment revenues  the majority of which are eliminated in consolidation  declined from million in to million in due to i the very heavy production of tomatoes from florida and grapes from chile  which kept prices very low throughout the first six months of  ii the curtailment of production volumes during certain weeks in the first half of the year due to the low prices  and iii the termination in march of absa s joint venture arrangement with santa cruz empacadora  s 
de rl de rl  a grower based in baja california sur  which led to a substantial reduction in production volume in the second half of the operating loss of the farming segment declined from million in to million in this reduction in the operating loss was due to the termination of absa s joint ventures  which experienced large losses in revenues of the distribution segment decreased from million in to million in this decline was largely a consequence of the volume reduction stemming from the termination of the santa cruz joint venture  which most severely affected the us distribution companies 
premier fruits and vegetables in canada and interfruver in mexico were able to continue their strong performances in versus because of the greater variety of products they sell as compared with the company s us distribution subsidiaries 
the operating loss of the distribution segment increased from million in to million in and was concentrated in the company s largest shipping and distributing subsidiaries bionova produce  inc in nogales  arizona and interfruver in mexico 
the primary factors that contributed to the larger operating loss of bionova produce  inc were i a million sales decrease emanating from a reduction in grape volumes and prices which impacted commissions earned and ii a million write off of growers and accounts receivables as compared with a million write off in in conjunction with the termination of a contract with a mexican grower of mangoes  papaya  and other fruit products on which the company had lost money over the past two years 
interfruver s operating profit declined by million from to due largely to higher selling and administrative expenses incurred for consulting and other services 
revenues of the research and development segment declined from million in to million in the most significant factor accounting for this decline in revenues was a catchup payment made by savia to dnap in under the long term founded research agreement between savia and dnap which was terminated on december   savia was obligated to fund dnap at least million in research payments over each three year period  the first of which ended on september  to meet this obligation savia paid dnap million in the decline in revenues translated directly to lower gross profit generation in this segment of the business 
research expenses decreased by million due primarily to a reduction in supervisory personnel 
the lower gross profit  offset in part by the lower research expenses  led to an operating loss in the research and development segment of million in  as compared with an operating loss of million in consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was due to higher professional fees and severance payments associated with the re structuring of the company s fresh produce operations  higher legal expenses associated with shareholder litigation cases  and a special charge incurred by interfruver for outside services and consulting advice in connection with its expansion strategy and operations during the first six months of  offset in part by the benefits of the re structuring during the second half of the year 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to a higher overall level of debt outstanding and the amortization of the debt issuance costs upon the retirement in april of the company s senior guaranteed floating rate notes issued on march  interest income increased from million in to million in due to a higher level of grower receivables that came about from a shift in absa s strategy to reduce its own farming activity and utilize third party growers to provide an increasing proportion of absa s supply 
an extraordinary charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of to recognize the remaining balance of up front fees paid for the floating rate note facility that was retired in april an extraordinary gain of million was recognized at year end due to the reversal of accrued interest that was accounted for as a capital contribution in conjunction with the agreements that were signed on december  for  the share of losses allocable to minority interests was million as compared with minority interest losses of million in these allocations of losses for the years of and  respectively  were consistent with the minority positions held across the operating subsidiaries of the company 
income tax expense declined from million in to million in this decline was due primarily to a reduction in the income of interfruver from to quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our statements of operations for each of the four quarters ended december  and each of the four quarters ended december  this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k

major investment projects in included the reconstruction of a packing shed in culiacan which had been damaged by fire  the acquisition and installation of a fully automatic tomato sorting and packing line  and the purchase of hectares of farm land in guerrero  mexico 
the company currently projects capital spending of million in  which is focused on the construction of hothouses used for the growing of tomatoes in the state of baja california sur in mexico 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company used million of cash in operating activities 
the great majority of this cash usage in operations was associated with the losses sustained by the company million  offset to a large extent by non cash items million 
the positive cash flow impact of changes in accounts receivable and advances to growers of million was due to stronger collection efforts 
inventories increased by million reflecting the investment in the farming segment for the new harvesting season  primarily materials for packing 
other assets increased by million due to various prepayments of insurance  leases and rents 
for the year ended december   the company used million in investing activities  which included the million spent on property  plant  and equipment  as discussed above  and million received in  net of cash acquired  on the sales of vpp s strawberry assets  tanimura distributing  inc  and interfruver 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
net borrowings from us banks increased by million which was used to fund grower advances  other operational needs and capital investments of the fresh produce business 
in absa retired all of its short term debt facilities with mexican banks  which totaled million at january  savia provided all of the funds towards the retirement of these debt facilities 
savia provided an additional million for the retirement of mexican bank debt in december savia also provided funds to support the company s technology business and the payment of corporate overhead under a cash support agreement  which is discussed below 
in total  savia provided bionova holding and its subsidiaries with million of cash in on december  bionova holding entered into two agreements with savia  which were intended to substantially change the business and financial structure of the company 
the purchase agreement purchase agreement  to which savia s subsidiary ag biotech capital  llc is also a party  provided that bionova holding would sell its fresh produce farming and distribution business including all of the debt and liabilities of the fresh produce business to savia for million 
in acquiring the fresh produce business savia would purchase of the shares held by bionova holding in absa and iphc 
the purchase price for the fresh produce business was to be paid by the application of million of advances previously made by savia to bionova holding 
as a component of the purchase agreement  on december  bionova holding issued shares of convertible preferred stock to bionova international for million  which was paid through the application of all of the remaining outstanding advances previously made by savia to bionova holding other than the million which was to be applied to the sale of the fresh produce business 
the shares of preferred stock  all of which bionova international has transferred to ag biotech capital  llc  are convertible into  shares of common stock a conversion ratio based on per share at any time after adoption and filing by the company of a charter amendment increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock to at least  the company will not receive any additional consideration upon the conversion of the preferred stock 
bionova holding and savia also entered into a cash support agreement for this agreement provided that  during  savia would advance funds to bionova holding as requested to finance bionova holding s technology business 
during  savia advanced million under this agreement 
these advances are to be applied to the purchase by savia ie  exchanged for of additional common shares if and when the sale of the fresh produce business is closed 
the purchase price to be paid by savia for the additional shares under the cash support agreement will be per share  subject to certain adjustments if the market price exceeds 
if the sale of the fresh produce business is completed pursuant to the purchase agreement  and the preferred stock is converted to common stock as described above  then the capitalization of the amounts advanced under the cash support agreement will increase savia s beneficial interest in bionova holding to 
as of january   it is not expected that savia will make any further advances to the company 
by completing these transactions the company expected to eliminate million of advances due to savia in march  an obligation the company believed it probably would not be able to meet 
in addition  the company was to be freed of all debt obligations associated with the fresh produce business 
when the sale of the fresh produce business was completed  and in conjunction with the cash support agreement  the company would have no outstanding related party advances or third party debt 
the company expected to spend its entire energies in in refining its technology strategy and raise a first round of new financing to fund its technology business through a period of time to demonstrate the efficacy of its strategy 
efforts during to raise new financing and complete contracts with new research partners failed to result in any commitments  in part due to market conditions and in part due to the perceived uncertainty about the company arising from the appellate court ruling in favor of the grace brothers in january and the judgment granted in favor of the grace brothers in an amount of million in august while the company  with the financial assistance of savia  finally settled the grace brothers litigation in december  the company then had to confront the implications of the termination of savia s cash support as of december  and the increasing magnitude of bionova holding s indebtedness to savia 
also  as a consequence of the significant financial losses sustained in  bionova holding s stockholders equity had become a deficit of million at december  company management and its board of directors have been and are continuing to explore their options in and beyond 
among the options being considered is the possible cancellation of the sale of the fresh produce business to savia 
with the re structuring of the business operations undertaken in  on a pro forma basis  the fresh produce business generated its first operating profit  albeit only million  for the first time since the pro forma basis excludes the charge for the impairment of the goodwill of the fresh produce business and the losses recorded on the divestitures of interfruver and tdi 
however  after interest and taxes  the fresh produce business still experienced a net loss for the year 
projections of this business segment for reflect a continuing improvement in operating profit  but this improvement remains a function of effective execution of its strategy along with favorable weather and economic industry conditions that are outside of its control 
as a consequence of indefinitely postponing the sale of the fresh produce business  this segment of the business no longer will be treated as discontinued operations and the advances by savia have now been re characterized as short term debt 
bionova holding s balance sheet at december  reflected that the company was in a position of technical insolvency  as its current assets of million fell far short of its current liabilities of million 
bank debt and debt to savia and savia s subsidiaries constituted million of the current liabilities 
all of the company s million of bank debt million of which was current is associated with bionova produce  inc there are three primary components to this debt 
bionova produce  inc had a million revolving line of credit  the principal of which is due in full on september  interest is charged at the us prime rate of interest at december   and interest payments are made on a monthly basis 
the line is secured by a pledge of bionova produce  inc s accounts receivable  inventory and general intangibles and is guaranteed by savia 
the key covenants associated with this line of credit are that bionova produce  inc must maintain a minimum net worth of million  a current ratio of at least to  and a year end leverage ratio debt to tangible net worth of no more than to all other debt of bionova produce  inc to savia is subordinated to the bank  additional borrowings in excess of million require bank approval  and bionova produce  inc may not loan or advance money to savia or seminis 
the second component of the debt is a five year loan secured by real property and is guaranteed by savia 
the loan is for million and is due august  principal and interest payments of approximately  are due monthly 
the interest rate on this debt is per annum 
the third component of the bank debt is a term loan in an amount of million which is due on june  interest is charged at the us prime rate of interest plus and is to be paid on a monthly basis 
this term loan is secured by real estate in nogales  arizona and san diego  california and is guaranteed by savia 
the loan is subject to the same net worth and other financial covenants as the revolving line of credit 
in conjunction with savia s loan guarantees  savia has taken liens on certain of absa s assets as security for this debt 
at december  bionova holding and its subsidiaries were indebted to savia and its subsidiaries other than bionova holding in a total amount of million 
of this total million was owed by absa and is accruing interest at a rate of approximately per annum 
bionova holding had debt of million to savia  which consisted of the million of advances made in april  million of advances made to bionova holding by savia in under a cash support agreement  and million of interest that had accrued on this debt 
the bionova holding debt currently is accruing interest at a rate of approximately per annum 
other subsidiaries of bionova holding had related party accounts due to savia and its subsidiaries that accounted for the balance of the million 
all of the bionova holding debt originally was due to be paid by march   but was extended by agreement between bionova holding and savia until december  the other related party accounts due to savia and its subsidiaries have varying maturities  and all are due at various times during at this time  bionova holding does not know how this indebtedness will be handled 
in addition to the board of director s decision to postpone the sale of the company s fresh produce business  the other significant action being undertaken by the company is the aggressive pursuit of a variety of alternatives for its technology business  including new research contracts  partnerships  third party financing  and the sale of assets 
cash resources emanating from bionova holding s fresh produce business during the first half of are highly dependent on the outcome of the culiacan harvest season  which will end in may to date  production and revenues  and hence cash generation  have run well below projections due to weather conditions that delayed the harvest and low prices for its product during the months of february and march 
the company remains hopeful that it will make up the deficiency during the months of april and may 
if the company does not meet its cash projections for the harvest season  in all likelihood bionova holding will have to cut back and or terminate some business operations 
there can be no assurance that these actions will result in sufficient working capital to significantly improve the company s current financial position or its results of operations 
the company also must find a solution to the million of debt plus the interest which is accruing that is due to savia and its subsidiaries during while the company is actively seeking to develop alternative sources of funding  there can be no assurance the company will be able to meet its obligations in nor secure funds to take it beyond the calendar year 
additional financing may not be available to the company on favorable terms  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  bionova holding may be unable to execute its business plan 
as a result of the company s current financial position caused by its operating losses during the prior years and its financial projections for this year and beyond  there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
impacts of the retention of the fresh produce business in december bionova holding agreed to sell its fresh produce business to savia 
the company subsequently treated this business segment i as discontinued operations on its statement of operations for the years ended december    and  ii as net assets of discontinued operations on its balance sheet for the year ended december   and iii as discontinued operations and net assets of discontinued operations in its financial statements filed for the quarters ended march  june  and september  for reasons identified in previous sections of this k  the company did not proceed to complete the sale in and has no current plans to do so 
therefore  the results of operations of the fresh produce business have been reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for these prior periods and the net assets from discontinued operations in the december  balance sheet were reclassified to their respective balance sheet accounts 
note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k provides the accounting for total segment assets  liabilities  revenues  and operating losses for each of the years the fresh produce business was reported as discontinued operations 
for accounting purposes  the pending sale of the fresh produce business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction as any differences between cash received and assets transferred to the parent would have been treated as capital contributions or distributions 
the fresh produce business has had highly material effects on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december    and revenues from this business segment were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these revenues represented   and of total bionova holding revenues for each of these three years  respectively 
the operating losses associated with the fresh produce business in   and  respectively  were million  million  and million  as compared with total company operating losses for each of these three years of million  million  and million  respectively 
capital spending by the company in was dominated by the fresh produce business 
the fresh produce business accounted for million out of the total of million in capital expenditures made in a primary consideration in the decision to retain the fresh produce business is its potential to generate positive cash flows 
as this business segment has not achieved a positive annual net cash flow in the six years it has been a part of bionova holding  there is considerable risk as to whether it will be able to generate consistently positive cash flows to support the company s cash needs in the future 
furthermore  in retaining the fresh produce business and failing to execute against the purchase agreement  the company failed to relieve itself of the million of indebtedness that bionova holding and its subsidiaries are obligated to savia and its subsidiaries along with the million of bank debt held by the company s fresh produce subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies bionova holding s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues and costs of revenues  receivables  inventories  and intangible assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes of consolidated financial statements revenues  cost of sales  and inventories revenue from product development activities is recognized during the period the company performs the development efforts in accordance with the terms of the agreements and activities undertaken 
the revenue is recognized as earned over the term of the agreement  in accordance with the performance effort 
revenue that is related to future performance under such agreements is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
revenue from fresh produce sales is recognized when the product is shipped  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out method for finished produce 
cost of growing crops includes direct material and labor and an allocation of indirect costs and are accumulated until the time of the harvest  subject to lower of cost or market adjustments 
the recognition of cost of sales for the delivered products is done based upon estimates of the total cost of the crop for the growing season divided by the number of units that are expected to be harvested  packed  and sold 
under this approach  we compare costs incurred to date plus estimated costs to complete and deliver the entire crop with the total net revenue expected to be generated from the crop 
estimates of the net revenues from the crop require projections of production yields from the field and the packaging lines  quality grades of the product to be delivered  and market prices during the months that constitute the crop harvest season 
each month  the company re estimates the cost of sales per unit of product sold based on any revisions to the estimated total cost of the crop and the units of output expected 
if the total cost of sales for the crop season is expected to be greater than the total revenues to be generated  taking into account the units of production still remaining to be harvested  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
such changes to these estimates have on certain occasions been material to our quarterly results of operations during the three year period ended december  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
our reserve for excess or obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted demand for our products and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the units of output method of accounting affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our revenue  cost of sales estimates and inventory reserves  including weather conditions  competitive production from different growing areas  labor availability and costs  and customer demand for our products 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements 
advances to growers advances to growers are made for supplies  seed  and other growing and harvesting costs 
the advances are interest bearing and non interest bearing and repaid from amounts withheld from sales proceeds due to growers 
all of the growers produce is sold by the company s distribution subsidiaries 
as sales are made and collections from customers are generated  the company s distribution subsidiaries deduct their commissions  and the amount of money advanced to the grower on a per unit basis before any monies from the sale and collection process are passed along to the grower 
if the company determines that the harvest of the grower will not generate sufficient output and revenues to pay back any advances that have been made to the grower  a review is then undertaken to determine the likelihood that the grower will be able to pay back these advances  plus any interest owed on the advances 
if the company determines that the grower may not be able to pay the advances back to the company  a reserve is recorded in an amount that is determined to be at risk on the collection of the grower advance 
in and the company recorded significant allowances for doubtful accounts of grower receivables and re classified one grower receivable to a long term asset on which it is trying to collect through a lawsuit it initiated in the company did not write off any grower receivables in impairment of long lived assets each year management determines whether any long lived have been impaired based on the criteria established in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flow from the asset is less than its carrying amount 
in that event  the company records a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds projected discounted future net cash flow arising from the asset 
changes in the company s projected cash flows as well as differences in the discount rate used in the calculation could have a material effect on the financial statements 
as stated previously  due to changes in business strategy and the current financial condition of the company  it was determined at year end that all of the goodwill in both the fresh produce and technology businesses was impaired along with certain technology patents 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  including without limitation statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including statements regarding our financial position  business strategy  prospects  plans and objectives of our management for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give you no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following risk factors  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause these results during and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
when we use the terms bionova  we  us  and our  these terms refer to the company and its subsidiaries 
risks relating to our financial condition we may continue to sustain losses and accumulate deficits in the future we have sustained losses in every year of our existence from through as of december  our accumulated deficit was million 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
the factors that caused these losses  including factors described in this section  may continue to limit our ability to make a profit in the future 
we will need additional financing to achieve our growth and technology objectives  which could hurt our financial condition we will need additional capital to meet our growth objectives  working capital requirements  and to fund the purchase and development of new technologies 
our projected cash flows from operations and existing capital resources  including our existing credit lines  may not be sufficient 
therefore  our ability to pursue these objectives may depend on our ability to obtain additional capital  which could cause us to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities 
we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all  and  as a result  we may be restricted in our pursuit of future growth and technology strategies 
our leveraged position could cause us to be unable to meet our capital needs  which could hurt our financial condition at december  we had a working capital deficit of million and a stockholders deficit of million 
we had million of debt with banks and million of debt with savia and savia s subsidiaries 
this level of indebtedness may pose substantial risks to our company and to our stockholders  including the possibility that we may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay our outstanding debts 
our level of indebtedness may also adversely affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness and finance our future operations and capital needs  and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities 
risks relating to our farming and distribution business bad weather and crop disease can affect the amount of produce we can grow  which can decrease our revenues and profitability weather conditions greatly affect the amount of fresh produce we bring to market  and  accordingly  the prices we receive for our produce 
storms  frosts  droughts  and particularly floods  can destroy a crop and less severe weather conditions  such as excess precipitation  cold weather and heat  can kill or damage significant portions of a crop 
crop disease and pestilence can be unpredictable and can have a devastating effect on our crops  rendering them unsalable and resulting in the loss of all or a portion of the crop for that harvest season 
even when only a portion of our crops are damaged  the profits we could have made on the crop will be severely affected because the costs to plant and cultivate the entire crop will have been incurred although we may experience low yields or may only be able to sell a portion of our crop 
labor shortages and union activity can affect our ability to hire workers to harvest and distribute our crops  which can hurt our financial condition the production of fresh produce is heavily dependent upon the availability of a large labor force to harvest crops 
the turnover rate among the labor force is high due to the strenuous work  long hours  necessary relocation and relatively low pay 
if it becomes necessary to pay more to attract labor to farm work  our labor costs will increase 
the mexican farm work force retained by absa is unionized 
if the union attempts to disrupt production and is successful on a large scale  labor costs will likely increase and work stoppages may be encountered  which would be particularly damaging in our industry where harvesting crops at peak times and getting them to market on a timely basis is critical 
the majority of fresh produce is shipped by truck 
in the united states and in mexico  the trucking industry is largely unionized and therefore susceptible to labor disturbances 
as a result  delivery delays caused by labor disturbances in the trucking industry or any other reason could limit our ability to get fresh produce to market before it spoils 
absa s reliance on leases and production associations could result in increased costs  which could adversely affect our financial results absa relies on agricultural land leased from others  production associations with other growers  and contract production with third party growers for a large part of its supply 
the average term of the land leases is two years and we expect to renew most of these land leases as they expire 
if the other parties to these leases were to choose not to renew their agreements with absa  absa would be required to locate alternate sources of supply and or land or  in some cases  to pay increased rents for land 
in addition to increased rental rates  increases in land costs could result from increases in water charges  property taxes and related expenses 
production associations and contract production with third party growers are generally arranged three to six months prior to each growing season 
the provisions of the contracts with these growers may change from year to year  which can affect the amount of supply  the prices of the produce  and the cost and profit sharing arrangements among the parties 
if these other growers choose not to renew their contracts  absa would be required to locate alternate sources of supply  which may or may not be available 
risk relating to our technology business we may not be able to form the strategic alliances necessary to implement our technology business plan development and commercialization of the company s technologies depends on customer relationships and strategic alliances with other companies 
if the company cannot find customers or strategic partners in the future  or if the company cannot maintain existing strategic alliances  the company may not be able to develop its technologies or products 
if the company does not develop commercially successful products  its business may be significantly harmed 
since the company s technologies have many potential applications and it has limited resources  our focus on any particular area may result in a failure to capitalize on more profitable areas 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain the intellectual property rights necessary to implement our technology business plan for our business plan to succeed we will need to develop new technology and to acquire rights to technology owned by third parties 
we may not be able to negotiate agreements to use all of the technology we will need  leaving us unable to grow the company in accordance with our projections 
the company may not be successful in obtaining patents on new technology  protecting its trade secrets and conducting its business without infringing on the rights of others  which could adversely affect our business 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to obtain and enforce patents  maintain trade secret protection  and conduct its business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if others develop competing technologies and market competing products  the company s sales could be adversely affected 
if the company is not able to maintain its trade secrets or to enforce its patents  the company s competitive position could be adversely affected 
in addition  the company licenses technology from third parties 
if the company cannot maintain these licenses  or if it cannot obtain licenses to other useful technology on commercially reasonable terms  its research and commercialization efforts could be adversely affected 
any inability to adequately protect the company s proprietary technologies could harm its competitive position 
furthermore  litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require the company to spend time and money and could shut down some of its operations 
because the company may not be able to obtain appropriate patents or licenses  it may not be able to successfully operate its business 
the company intends to conduct proprietary research programs  and any conflicts with its strategic partners could harm its business 
we may not be able to keep up with advances in technology genomic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
the company s future success will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the integration of functional genomics with plant transformation and evaluation to create an efficient and cost effective product pipeline 
rapid technological development by the company or others may result in products or technologies becoming obsolete before the company recovers the expenses incurred in connection with their development 
products offered by the company  its customers or its strategic partners could be made obsolete by less expensive or more effective crop enhancement and nutrition enhancement technologies  including technologies that may be unrelated to genomics 
the company may not be able to make the enhancements to its technology necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
we may lose the scientists and management personnel necessary to implement our technology business plan the company depends on the services of a number of key personnel  and a loss of any of these personnel could disrupt operations and delay development of new technologies 
the realization of the company s new business strategy depends on  among other things  its ability to hire  train and retain qualified employees to allow operations to be effectively managed 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the ag biotech industry the company faces significant competition in its chosen fields novel crop protection traits and specialized technology services 
the company may not be able to compete effectively  which could cause its business to suffer 
both traditional and specialized agricultural chemical firms offer competing technology eg  traditional chemicals and biopesticides that can be deployed against fungal disease and nematodes pests 
several agricultural chemical firms offer novel crop protection traits through biotechnology as well 
there are also many companies engaged in research and product development activities based on agricultural biotechnology 
competitors include specialized biotechnology firms  as well as major pharmaceutical  food and chemical companies that have biotechnology divisions  many of which have considerably greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than the company 
competition may intensify as technological developments occur at a rapid rate in the agricultural biotechnology industry 
we may not complete the development of  or be able to successfully commercialize new technology products and services if the products the company develops and markets are not commercial successes  it will not recoup its development and production costs  which will hurt its financial condition 
the company is currently in the early stages of research and development  and there can be no assurance that any of its projects will be successful or will produce significant revenues or profits 
the success of these and future products depends on many variables  including technical risks associated with using genetic engineering for crop protection and nutrition  business risks associated with selecting commercial targets and capturing value from customers 
the company may be sued for product liability  which  if a suit were successful  could cause it to face substantial liabilities that exceed its resources 
the company may be held liable if any product it develops  or any product that is made using its technologies  causes injury or is found unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
these risks are inherent in the development of agricultural and food products 
the company currently does not have product liability insurance 
if it chooses to obtain product liability insurance  but cannot obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  the commercialization of products that the company s customers  strategic partners  or that it develops may be prevented 
if the company is sued for any injury caused by its products  its liability could exceed its total assets 
we may not gain public acceptance for our genetically engineered products if the public is unwilling to accept genetically engineered products  the company will not recoup its development and production costs  which will hurt its financial condition 
social and environmental concerns may limit the acceptance of genetically engineered products 
most of the company s products are being developed through the use of genetic engineering 
the commercial success of these products will depend in part on public acceptance of the cultivation and consumption of genetically engineered products 
the company cannot assure you that these products will gain sufficient public acceptance to be profitable  even if these products obtain the required regulatory approvals 
public debate surrounding food and fiber crops continues 
technology critics have urged us regulatory agencies to tighten their regulation of biotechnology crops  including withdrawal of certain product registrations  implementation of product labeling  and stricter pre market approval procedures 
internationally  agricultural biotechnology issues are being debated within the world trade organization  the united nations convention on biological diversity  the codex alimentarius  and on several regional fronts 
the company believes that progress has been made to ensure that science based rules form the basis for international trade of agricultural biotechnology products 
however  the extent of government regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative actions and the potential consequences to the business is not known and cannot be predicted with certainty 
government regulation government regulation can cause delays and increased costs  which may decrease the company s revenues and profitability 
stringent laws may limit the market for genetically engineered agricultural products that it may develop 
business opportunities and products developed using technology developed by the company may be subject to a lengthy and uncertain government regulatory process that may not result in the necessary approvals  may delay the commercialization of its customers products or may be costly  which could harm its business 
the company s activities in the united states are extensively regulated by the food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture  the environmental protection agency  and other federal and state regulatory agencies 
also  the company s genetically engineered products may require regulatory approval or notification in the united states or in other countries in which they are tested  used or sold 
the regulatory process may delay research  development  production  or marketing and require more costly and time consuming procedures  and there can be no assurance that requisite regulatory approvals or registration of the company s current or future genetically engineered products will be granted on a timely basis 
risks relating to our international operations legal limitations could affect our ownership of rural land in mexico  which could decrease our supply of produce causing a decrease in our revenues and profitability absa owns a substantial amount of rural land in mexico  which it uses to grow fresh fruits and vegetables 
historically  the ownership of rural land in mexico has been subject to legal limitations and claims by residents of rural communities  which in some cases could lead to the owner being forced to surrender its land 
absa has been  and continues to be  involved in land dispute proceedings as part of its ordinary course of business 
if absa is required to surrender any of its land  the volume of fresh fruits and vegetables it produces would decline and adversely affect our profitability 
there is currently pending in mexico a lawsuit challenging the ownership rights of absa to rural land it owns in mexico 
if this lawsuit was to be decided against absa  absa could lose a total of of all the rural land it owns in mexico 
currency fluctuations and inflation can increase the cost of our products in the united states and abroad  which decreases our revenues and profitability while currency exchange rates in mexico have been relatively stable over the past three years  previous history has shown that these rates can be highly volatile 
for example  in december  the mexican government announced its intention to float the mexican peso against the united states dollar and  as a result  the peso devalued over relative to the dollar during that month 
exchange rate fluctuations impact our subsidiaries businesses 
if the value of the peso decreases relative to the value of the dollar  then i imports of produce into mexico for distribution become more expensive in peso terms and therefore more difficult to sell in the mexican market  and ii inflation that generally accompanies reductions in the value of the peso reduces the purchasing power of mexican consumers  which reduces the demand for all products including produce and  in particular  imported  branded or other premium quality produce 
conversely  if the value of the peso increases relative to the value of the dollar  mexican production costs increase in dollar terms  which results in lower margins or higher prices with respect to produce grown in mexico and sold in the united states and canada 
volatile interest rates in mexico can increase our capital costs historically  interest rates in mexico have been volatile  particularly in times of economic unrest and uncertainty 
high interest rates restrict the availability and raise the cost of capital for our mexican subsidiaries and for growers and other mexican parties with whom we do business  both for borrowings denominated in pesos and for borrowings denominated in dollars 
costs of operations for our mexican subsidiaries are higher as a result 
trade disputes between the united states and mexico can result in tariffs  quotas and bans on imports  including our products  which can hurt our financial condition despite the enactment of the north american free trade agreement  mexico and the united states from time to time are involved in trade disputes 
the united states has  on occasion  imposed tariffs  quotas  and importation bans on products produced in mexico 
us tomato growers have brought dumping claims against mexican tomato growers and may do so again 
because some of our subsidiaries produce products in mexico  which we sell in the united states  such actions  if taken  could adversely affect our business 
general business risks savia and ag biotech capital  llc have substantial control over the company and can affect virtually all decisions made by its stockholders and directors ag biotech capital  llc beneficially owns  shares of our common stock accounting for of all issued and outstanding shares 
as a result  ag biotech capital  llc has the requisite voting power to significantly affect virtually all decisions made by the company and its stockholders  including the power to elect all directors and to block corporate actions such as an amendment to most provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation 
this ownership and management structure will inhibit the taking of any action by the company that is not acceptable to ag biotech capital  llc 
we may incur significant liability as a result of stockholder lawsuits the company and its subsidiary  dna plant technology corporation  have been sued in several lawsuits relating to the merger transaction the merger in which dnap became a subsidiary of the company 
in some of those lawsuits  the former preferred stockholders of dnap alleged they should have received much more consideration for their shares in the merger than they did 
though the trial courts in these cases dismissed all of the claims  two of these cases are still under appeal 
if the company is ultimately found to be liable in these cases  the value of the potential judgment could be far more than the company could afford to pay 
we may not be able to adapt our management information systems and controls to keep pace with our future business strategy  which could hurt our financial condition the realization of our business strategy depends on  among other things  our ability to adapt management information systems and controls and to hire  train and retain qualified employees to allow these operations to be effectively managed 
the geographic separation of our subsidiaries operations exacerbates these issues
