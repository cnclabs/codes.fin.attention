item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
significant accounting policies and estimates that most impact our consolidated financial statements are those that relate to our property and equipment and income taxes 
property and equipment is stated at cost  reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value when management determines that such impairment has occurred 
major renovations and improvements are capitalized 
when assets are sold  retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized 
repair and maintenance costs are generally charged to expense as incurred 
buildings  furniture and fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives as of the acquisition date or date of major renovation 
estimated useful lives of our buildings are forty years  and furniture and fixtures and equipment have useful lives ranging from five to fifteen years 
we evaluate the realizability of our long lived assets  including furniture and fixtures and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value 
the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be computed annually for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the income tax provision or credit is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
income tax credits attributable to benefits from net operating loss carryforwards or other temporary differences that existed at the time the company adopted fresh start accounting in february upon its bankruptcy reorganization are reflected as a contribution to stockholders equity in the period in which the tax benefits are realized 
overview the operations of the company are comprised primarily of the operations of hotels

total number of rooms sold during a year divided by the total number of rooms available in such year 
average daily rate equals total room revenue exclusive of taxes during a year divided by rooms sold 
revenue per available room equals total room revenues exclusive of taxes during a year  divided by rooms available for sale during such year 
hotel was leased april  hotel was sold june  hotel acquired september  and sold december  hotel was sold june  year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  our business was negatively impacted by both the general economic downturn and the reduced travel and cancellations experienced after the terrorist attacks of september  prior to that date  due to the general economic conditions  the company implemented programs to reduce operating expenses at owned hotels 
management continues to monitor operations for cost savings and is pursuing new marketing initiatives to attract business 
in the discussion that follows  comparable hotels means only those hotels owned and operated by the company since january  and still owned and operated as of december  
room and related services revenue decreased to  from  in for comparable hotels i the average daily room rate decreased to for from for  ii occupancy decreased in to from in  and iii room and related services revenue decreased to  from  in management believes that the decrease in occupancy was lessened to some extent by a reduction in room rates 
however  this strategy was not entirely successful in overcoming the factors described in the opening paragraph 
food and beverage revenues decreased to  in from  in for comparable hotels  food and beverage revenues decreased 
these results reflected not only the effects of the slowing economy but also a decrease in the banquet business resulting from cancellations after the events of september  management fee income decreased to  in from  in this decrease is primarily due to lower operating results at managed properties and a reduction in construction supervision fees

depreciation decreased by  in from  in the decrease was primarily attributable to depreciation on hotel properties sold in and  offset by depreciation on capital additions completed in and an impairment loss of  was recognized in related to the knights inn hotel property 
the amount of the loss was determined based on a comparison of the carrying value of the property with its fair value 
this value was based on the purchase option included in a lease agreement for the property 
the exercise period for the option is may  through may  interest income decreased to  in from  in as interest rates and funds on deposit decreased 
interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was attributable to the subordinated debt issued in exchange for the redemption of preferred stock held by the company s controlling stockholders messrs

a corresponding decrease in the preferred dividend resulted from the redemption of the preferred stock held by messrs 
beck and yeaggy

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand including escrow deposits and replacement reserves  cash from operations  earnings on invested cash and  when required  principally in connection with acquisitions  borrowings consisting primarily of loans secured by mortgages on real property owned or to be acquired by the company 
the company s continuing operations are funded through cash generated from its hotel operations 
acquisitions of hotels  if pursued by the company  are expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand  internally generated cash  issuance of equity securities and borrowings  some of which are likely to be secured by assets of the company 
there can be no assurance that credit will be available to the company or  if available  that such credit will be available on terms and in amounts satisfactory to the company 
capital for improvements to owned hotels has been and is expected to be provided by a combination of internally generated cash  reserve replacement accounts and  if necessary and available  borrowings 
the company expects to spend approximately to of annual revenues from owned hotels for ongoing capital expenditures 
the company maintains a number of commercial banking relationships and has aggregate lines of credit totaling  there is an outstanding balance of  on the lines of credit at december   most of which represents borrowings used to fund operations during the latter part of december the company evaluates opportunities to acquire additional hotel properties from time to time 
if management identifies one or more properties as attractive acquisition candidates  the company anticipates that it will be able to secure the capital required to close purchases through a combination of borrowing  internally generated cash and utilization of its common and or preferred stock 
there can be no assurance however that the company will be able to negotiate sufficient borrowings to accomplish its acquisition program on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
further  any such borrowings may contain covenants that impose limitations on the company that could constrain or prohibit the company from making additional acquisitions as well as its ability to pay dividends or to make other distributions  incur additional indebtedness or obligations or to enter into other transactions that the company may deem beneficial 
additionally  factors outside of the company s control could affect its ability to secure additional funds on terms acceptable to the company 
those factors include  without limitation  any increase in the rate of inflation and or interest rates  localized or general economic dislocations  an economic downturn and regulatory changes constricting the availability of credit 
contractual obligations the following table provides details regarding the company s contractual cash obligations subsequent to december  contractual cash obligations by year thereafter total mortgage debt  fixed rate      mortgage debt  variable rate     subordinate debt   capital leases    total contractual cash obligations      at december   the company was in default for nonpayment on four mortgage loans totaling  which are collateralized by hotel properties with a net book value of  in the vicinity of cleveland  ohio  but which are otherwise non recourse to the other assets of the company 
management suspended payments on these loans on november  as a means of inducing the mortgage loan servicer to engage in discussions regarding the renegotiation of the loans interest rate 
the company and the mortgage loan servicer have entered into a pre negotiation agreement which describes each party s rights and remedies under the current loan documents 
due to the company s suspension of loan repayments  the outstanding indebtedness may be declared due and payable  in full  at any time 
accordingly  the amount of such indebtedness is included as a contractual obligation in management believes that the applicable interest rate is substantially in excess of current market rates 
however  substantial prepayment penalties preclude the possibility of refinancing these loans in the absence of cooperation by the existing lenders 
the loans are held in a syndicated pool of commercial mortgage loans which makes the possibility of a modification of loan terms very difficult 
since november   all payments due under these loans were deposited into an interest bearing escrow account controlled by the company 
while negotiations are continuing with the mortgage loan servicer  the company is unable to predict at this time whether such discussions will result in modifications to the terms of the applicable mortgage loans 
moreover  management of the company has not evaluated its options if the discussions with the mortgage loan servicer are fruitless 
management of the company believes that the cash flow from the company s hotel operations  other than the hotel properties in the cleveland vicinity  will be sufficient to make the required amortization payments on the applicable mortgage loans 
balloon payments required at the maturity of the non self amortizing loans will be made from cash on hand at the time or from the proceeds of refinancing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing  or if obtained  on terms satisfactory to it 
demand at many of the hotels is affected by seasonal patterns 
demand for hotel rooms in the industry generally tends to be lower during the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters 
accordingly  the company s revenues reflect this seasonality 
historical changes in liquidity and capital resources total assets decreased from  at december  to  at december  the decrease in total assets was the result of decreases in property and equipment  net and offset by increases in restricted cash and accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of the net loss for during the year ended december   the company invested  in capital improvements for the owned hotels as part of its operating plan 
the company plans to spend  on capital improvements during the year ending december  as part of its continuing improvement plans for the owned hotels 
effective january   in a transaction approved by the company s board of directors and the audit committee   shares of preferred stock held by the company s controlling stockholders messrs 
beck and yeaggy were redeemed by the company 
the aggregate redemption price of  was paid in the form of subordinate promissory notes maturing on december  the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum 
interest only is payable on a quarterly basis 
if the redemption had occurred on january   income from continuing operations  on a pro forma basis  for the year ended december  would have been  or per basic and diluted common shares 
long term debt  net of current portion  at december   would have been  and total stockholders equity would have been  at a special meeting of stockholders on march   a company proposal to redeem the common stock of stockholders holding fewer than shares of the company s common stock was approved 
a total of  shares of common stock were redeemed at a cost of  these shares were retired and reduced the number of shares outstanding 
on october   the board of directors modified its previously approved stock buy back program and authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount not to exceed  during the company purchased  common shares at a cost of  in january  the company purchased an additional  common shares from daewoo corporation daewoo for  in a directly negotiated transaction 
prior to this transaction  daewoo owned more than of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
to date  a total of  common shares have been repurchased at a cost of  the board of directors has authorized management to engage in negotiations with the reorganization trust or another former creditor of us lines who remains a holder of a significant block of the company s stock and who may be interested in the disposition of its shares 
accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 business combinations and fasb statement no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
statement no 
applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  statement no 
also changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
we adopted this statement on july  we have historically used the purchase method to account for business combinations and the adoption of this statement did not materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which requires that goodwill and certain intangibles not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed annually for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
this statement applies to goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired prior to june  and was adopted by us on january  because the amount for the amortization of goodwill is significant  we expect that adoption of this accounting standard will have the impact of reducing our amortization expense for goodwill and will have a material impact on our financial statements 
for each of the years ended december   and  the amount of amortization expense for goodwill was  which is included in amortization expense on the statement of operations 
the required impairment test of goodwill may result in future period write downs 
in order to complete the transitional assessment of goodwill  we will need to determine the carrying value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit 
it was initially determined that our hotel properties are considered one reporting unit 
we will have up to six months from the date of adoption to finalize the determination of fair value of our reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  preliminary tests indicate that there is no impairment  therefore  there should be no material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas concerning the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale but provides additional guidance with regard to discontinued operations and assets to be disposed of 
furthermore  sfas excludes goodwill from its scope and  therefore  eliminates the requirement under sfas to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of sfas on january  is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
inflation although inflation has been relatively stable over the past two years and has not had any discernible effect on the company s operations  an increase in the inflation rate could have a negative effect on the company s operations and its ability to secure additional capital under terms and conditions acceptable to the company or refinance indebtedness secured by the owned hotels 
an increase in the rate of inflation could materially adversely affect the ability of the company to expand its operations through the acquisition of additional hotel properties
