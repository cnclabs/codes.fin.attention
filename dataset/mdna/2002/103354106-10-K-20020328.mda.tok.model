boyds does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and imports most of its products from manufacturers in the pacific rim  primarily the people s republic of china 
boyds ability to import products and thereby satisfy customer orders is affected by the availability of  and demand for  quality production capacity abroad

the collectibles area  in particular  is affected by changing consumer tastes and interests 
the giftware and collectibles industries are highly competitive  with a large number of both large and small participants

critical accounting policies preparing the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
predicating future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in boyds financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of boyds financial statements include estimates related to valuing the ultimate collectability of accounts receivable and realizable value of inventory 
in addition  a significant amount of judgment exists in defining deferred tax valuation accounts 
the process of determining estimates is based on several factors  including historical experience  current and anticipated economic conditions and customer profiles 
boyds continually reevaluates these key factors and makes adjustments to estimates where appropriate 
the following are boyds critical accounting policies  some of which require the application of significant estimates and assumptions 
sales revenue  net of returns and discounts  is recognized upon shipment of the items  when title passes to the customer 
the most significant financial statement line item  net sales  represents transactions consistent with boyds primary business focus and meet the criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
 including the transfer of title  probable collectability  identified customer and no recourse 
accounts receivable are presented at estimated net realizable value 
boyds uses estimates in determining the collectibility of its accounts receivable and must rely on its evaluation of historical bad debts  customer credit ratings  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms to arrive at appropriate reserves 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of earnings if actual experience differs significantly from management estimates 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined under the first in  first out method of accounting 
boyds records adjustments to the value of this inventory in situations where it appears that boyds will not be able to recover the cost of the product 
this lower of cost or market analysis is based on boyds estimate of forecasted demand by customer by product 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact boyds evaluation of its excess and obsolete inventories 
under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 boyds assessed the potential impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and acquired goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in performing this evaluation  the company evaluated current and future economic and business trends to develop business forecasts of future performance and related cash flows 
such estimates require the use of judgment and numerous subjective assumptions 
on january   boyds adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment using a new methodology  during the first six months of fiscal  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
boyds accounting policies are more fully described in
