item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this document contains certain forward looking statements which may be identified by the use of words such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  planned  estimated and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to our financial condition  results of operations and business that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates and most other statements that are not historical in nature 
these factors include  but are not limited to  general and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  demand for mortgage and other loans  real estate values  and competition  changes in accounting principles  policies  or guidelines  changes in legislation or regulation  and other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory  and technological factors affecting our operations  pricing products and services 
general chesterfield financial s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  securities and interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily savings accounts and time deposits 
our provisions for loan losses  other income and other expense also affect our results of operations 
other income consists primarily of insurance commissions and service charges on deposit accounts 
other expense consists primarily of non interest expenses  including salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment  data processing and deposit insurance premiums 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy our current business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable  community oriented savings and loan association dedicated to providing quality customer service 
generally  we have sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing deposits as its primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial portion of its assets in local residential first mortgage loans 
specifically  the business strategy incorporates the following elements emphasizing one to four family residential real estate lending  managing interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term mortgage loans and maintaining high levels of liquidity  conducting our business as a community oriented institution  and maintaining asset quality and capital strength 
highlights of the business strategy are as follows o emphasizing one to four family residential real estate lending 
historically  we have emphasized one to four family residential lending within our market area 
as of june   million  or of our total loan portfolio consisted of one to four family residential real estate loans 
during the year ended june   we originated million of one to four family residential real estate loans 
although the yields on residential mortgage loans are often less than the yields on other types of loans  we intend to continue to emphasize one to four family lending because of our expertise with this type of lending  and the relatively low delinquency rates on these loans compared to other loans 
o managing interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term loans and maintaining high levels of liquidity 
in recent years  we have emphasized the origination of shorter term seven  or year residential mortgage loans and have maintained high levels of liquidity 
in addition  when a borrower refinances a loan during periods of decreasing interest rates  we actively seek to reduce the term of the refinanced loan 
while short term loans generally offer lower interest rates than long term loans  short term loans increase monthly cash flows and reprice more quickly  allowing us greater flexibility in periods of rising interest rates 
o conducting our business as a community oriented institution 
we are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate 
we are large enough to provide a range of personal and business financial services  and yet are still small enough to provide these services on a personalized and efficient basis 
we believe that we can be more effective in servicing our customers than many of our non local competitors because of our ability to quickly and effectively provide senior management responses to customer needs and inquiries 
our ability to provide these services is enhanced by the stability of our senior management  which has an average tenure with us of over years 
o maintaining asset quality and capital strength 
through our commitment to conservative loan underwriting guidelines and the emphasis on traditional residential mortgage loans  we have consistently experienced low levels of late payments and losses on loans 
as of june   we had  of non performing assets  which represented of total assets 
in addition  we maintain our financial strength by maintaining high capital levels 
at june   our ratio of shareholders equity to assets was 
average balance sheet the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates

rate volume analysis the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to the changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate and ii changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
net income for the year ended june  was million  or diluted earnings per share  compared to net income of million for the year ended june  return on average assets for was  compared to for the improved return on assets in was primarily due to investment of proceeds from the mutual to stock conversion  while the related increase in average equity resulted in a decrease in return on equity to for  compared to for last year 
total interest income 
total interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  an increase in average interest earning assets of million resulted in a volume increase of million in interest income that was offset by a rate induced decrease of million in interest income  netting a decrease in yield on interest earning assets of basis points  to for  from for the prior year

interest expense 
interest expense on deposits decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the decrease was primarily attributable to the general decline in market interest rates for insured deposits and to management s repricing decisions  with the average cost of funds decreasing  to for the current year  from for last year 
a million net decrease in interest bearing deposits  and a change in the deposit mix favoring time deposits  resulted in a  volume increase in interest expense  while reduced rates accounted for a million decrease in interest expense

net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the same period in the net interest rate spread and the net interest margin increased during the period as the result of the drop in market interest rates  and helped by the increase in interest earning assets resulting from investment of the proceeds from the mutual to stock conversion

provision for loan losses 
management made no additional provision for loan losses for the year ended june   compared to a  provision for the year ended june  the provision for was partially attributable to credit quality concerns associated with certain community development loans and charge offs recorded during the year 
see business asset quality 
the credit quality concerns associated with these loans related to the borrower s ability to successfully redevelop certain parcels of land located near chesterfield federal s main office 
management estimates the probable collectibility of these loans on an ongoing basis based on information made available by the borrower 
a development plan for certain parcels was terminated in  and management recorded provisions for the loans based on alternative uses of the land because of the continued uncertainty associated with the borrower s ability to successfully redevelop the parcels 
during the current year  four of the community development loans were put on non accrual status due to failure to make timely payments 
all of the related community development loans are reported as substandard for regulatory purposes 
after a review of the present collectibility of these loans  management determined that no additional provision for loan loss was required 
the allowance for loan losses decreased to of loans outstanding at june  from at june  the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates 
the allowance for loan losses as of june  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio

during the years ended june  and  chesterfield insurance incurred operating expenses of million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to a  or increase in salaries and employee benefits  which included a  expense for the recognition and retention plan both included in the consolidated numbers in the last paragraph 
chesterfield insurance reported unconsolidated net income of  for the year ended june   and net losses of  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively

the credit quality concerns associated with these loans relate to the borrower s ability to successfully redevelop certain parcels of land located near chesterfield federal s main office 
management estimates the probable collectibility of these loans on an ongoing basis based on information made available by the borrower

noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to insurance commissions at chesterfield federal s insurance subsidiary 
insurance commissions increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  salaries and employee benefits represented and of total noninterest expense for the fiscal years ended june  and total salaries and employee benefits increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal ended june  the increase is primarily attributable to higher salary expenses resulting from general pay increases and an increase in retirement and other benefit expenses 
retirement and other benefit expenses increased  representing approximately of the  total salaries and benefit increase for the fiscal year 
the increase in retirement and other benefit expenses was partially attributable to the employee stock ownership plan established in conjunction with the conversion 
during   shares of common stock with an average fair value of per share were committed to be released  resulting in employee stock ownership plan compensation expense of  as of june   the esop held  shares of common stock of which  shares were allocated to participants

provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to million  or of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended june   from million  or for the fiscal year ended june  liquidity and capital resources chesterfield federal s liquidity management objective is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
chesterfield federal s primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
external sources of funds primarily consist of increases in deposits 
at june   chesterfield federal had loan commitments of million and unused lines of credit of million 
chesterfield federal believes it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments as they arise 
if chesterfield federal requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago could be made available 
at june   approximately million of time deposits were scheduled to mature within one year  and we expect that a portion of these time deposits will not be renewed upon maturity  which would reduce our liquidity 
if additional liquidity is needed  chesterfield federal is permitted to sell its existing loans in the secondary market 
however  chesterfield federal has not originated any loans for sale in the secondary market  and is restricted from selling loans to some potential purchasers because chesterfield federal s loan documents contain provisions that are more favorable to borrowers than permitted by the seller servicer guidelines of entities like fannie mae or freddie mac 
chesterfield financial does not engage in any significant business activity other than owning the common stock of chesterfield federal 
chesterfield financial s primary source of funds is income from its investments and principal and interest payments received with respect to the employee stock ownership plan loan 
future dividends from chesterfield federal will also be a source of funds for chesterfield financial  however  as a stock savings and loan association  chesterfield federal is subject to regulatory limitations on its ability to pay cash dividends 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two new accounting standards  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
was issued to improve the transparency of the accounting and reporting for business combinations by requiring that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
since this accounting standard applies to business combinations initiated after june   it will have no effect on the corporation s financial statements unless the corporation enters into a business combination transaction 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
this change provides investors with greater transparency regarding the economic value of goodwill and its impact on earnings 
the amortization of goodwill ceases upon the adoption of sfas no 
 which will be july  for the corporation 
the corporation has approximately  of unamortized goodwill that it will discontinue amortizing 
the adoption of this standard on july   is expected to result in lower amortization expense of approximately  the corporation performed an analysis of goodwill for impairment as of june   and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  this pronouncement will not have a material effect on the corporation 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
established a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no

are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  this pronouncement will not have a material effect on the corporation 
the fasb recently issued sfas no 
and no 
sfas no 
applies for years beginning after may  and may be adopted sooner 
sfas no 
covers extinguishments of debt and leases and includes some minor technical corrections 
under previous accounting guidance  gains or losses from extinguishments of debt were always treated as extraordinary items 
under sfas no 
 they will no longer be considered extraordinary  except under very limited conditions 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 any prior gains and losses from extinguishments of debt must be reclassified as ordinary gains and losses 
under sfas no 
 if a capital lease is modified to become an operating lease  it will be accounted for as a sale leaseback  by following the accounting guidance of sfas no 
 instead of being accounted for as a sale leaseback  by following the accounting guidance of sfas no 
 instead of being accounted for as a new lease 
sfas no 
covers accounting for costs associated with exit or long lived asset disposal activities  such as restructurings  consolidation or closing of facilities  lease termination costs  or employee relocation or severance costs 
sfas no 
replaces emerging issues task force eitf  and is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and may be adopted sooner 
a company may not restate its previously issued financial statements 
sfas no 
requires exit or long lived asset disposal costs to be recognized as an expense when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value  rather than at the date of making a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
management does not expect the effects of the future adoptions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to be material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes of chesterfield financial have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
as with other financial institutions  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  chesterfield federal s board of directors has established an asset liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in chesterfield federal s assets and liabilities  determining the level of risk that is appropriate given its business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
the asset liability management committee consists of senior management operating under a policy adopted by the board of directors and meets at least quarterly to review chesterfield federal s asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
in recent years  management has sought to reduce our interest rate risk by maintaining high levels of liquidity  and emphasizing the origination of shorter term seven  or year residential mortgage loans 
in addition  when a borrower refinances a loan during a period of decreasing interest rates  management actively seeks to reduce the term of the refinanced loan 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the office of thrift supervision provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the office of thrift supervision simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
the office of thrift supervision model estimates the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the us treasury yield curve shifts instantaneously and parallel up and down to basis points in basis point increments 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percentage point  and basis points equals one percentage point 
a change in interest rates to from would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the office of thrift supervision provides chesterfield federal the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information provided by chesterfield federal  to estimate the sensitivity of npv 
the table below sets forth  as of june   the estimated changes in chesterfield federal s npv that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the us treasury yield curve 
net portfolio value as a percent net portfolio value of present value of assets change in interest rates estimated amount of percent basis points npv change percent npv ratio change dollars in thousands due to the abnormally low prevailing interest rate environment  the ots report did not provide npv estimates for and basis points 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of chesterfield federal s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of chesterfield federal s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on its net interest income  and will differ from actual results
