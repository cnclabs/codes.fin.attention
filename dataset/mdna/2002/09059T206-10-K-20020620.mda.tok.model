item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop needle free injection systems that improve the way patients take medications and vaccines 
our long term goal is to become the leading supplier of needle free injection systems to the pharmaceutical industry 
in fiscal  we focused our business development efforts on new and existing licensing and supply agreements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
by bundling customized needle free delivery systems with partners injectable medications and vaccines  we can enhance demand for these products in the healthcare provider and end user markets 
in fiscal  our clinical research efforts were aimed primarily at clinical research collaborations in the areas of vaccines and delivery 
currently  we are involved in collaborations with approximately institutions 
in fiscal  our other research and development efforts were primarily focused on the development of the smaller  lighter iject tm ii  and the pre filled  disposable intradermal injector 
the iject tm ii has been modeled using a more streamlined design  thus making it more cost effective to manufacture while retaining the same flexibility and performance characteristics of the original iject tm 
the iject tm ii will be more economical for mid priced injectable drugs 
for vaccine delivery  we are developing a pre filled  disposable intradermal injector containing a very small power source and drug container  making it ideal for intradermal injections  which are typically ml in volume 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
various factors may affect quarterly and yearly operating results including i the length of time to close product sales  ii customer budget cycles  iii the implementation of cost reduction measures  iv uncertainties and changes in product sales due to third party payer policies and proposals relating to healthcare cost containment  v the timing and amount of payments under licensing and technology development agreements  and vi the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
we do not expect to report net income from operations in fiscal results of operations product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and  in fiscal product sales in fiscal and consisted primarily of sales to public health and flu immunization clinics 
the increase in product sales in fiscal is primarily due to sales of our cool 
click tm and serojet tm to serono 
serono uses the cool 
click tm for administering saizen recombinant human growth hormone and uses the serojet tm for aids wasting applications 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increases in unit sales volumes for b and cool 
click tm devices and syringes primarily to existing customers 
license and development fees increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal and  in fiscal we signed several license and technology development agreements in fiscal we received licensing fees from serono during each quarter of fiscal and  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we also received license fees and or technology development fees from alkermes  elan and amgen 
we received a non refundable development fee of million in the third quarter of fiscal from amgen  which was to be recognized over the term of our agreement with them 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  amgen terminated its license and development agreement and  accordingly  we recognized the entire million in the fourth quarter of fiscal no amounts are expected to be received from amgen under these agreements in fiscal the increase in license and development fees in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the timing of various licensing fees received from existing strategic corporate partnership agreements 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we amended our agreement with serono to provide them with exclusive worldwide distribution rights for their saizen recombinant human growth hormone using a customized version of our vitajet needle free delivery system called the cool 
click tm 
in addition  serono was given

manufacturing expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal we experienced increased costs in fiscal due to an increase in manufacturing personnel and unit sales volumes 
in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal we incurred one time costs associated with the start up of production of the serojet tm  which will be used by serono for aids wasting applications 
the increase in fiscal manufacturing expense is due to increased sales volume of b and cool

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
pursuant to december securities and exchange commission guidance  we have prepared the following discussion of critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues  and inventory reserves 
revenue recognition for product development and license fee revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  product development revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis as qualifying expenditures are incurred and licensing revenues  if separable  are recognized over the term of the license agreement 
should agreements be terminated prior to completion or our estimates of percentage of completion be incorrect  we could have unanticipated fluctuations in our revenue on a quarterly basis 
the fasb s emerging issues and task force eitf is evaluating the accounting for multiple element arrangements in 
table of contents eitf we believe our accounting policy is consistent with the views expressed by the eitf  however the accounting may change when final consensus is reached 
inventory reserves we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical and forecasted sales and usage rates  anticipated technology improvements and product upgrades  as well as other factors 
all inventories are reviewed annually to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices and if certain components have become obsolete 
we record reserves for inventory based on the above factors 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change
