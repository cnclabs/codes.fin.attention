item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company develops  manufactures  markets and distributes products and services that are widely used in biomedical research 
our products and services enable scientists to better understand the biochemistry  immunology and cell biology of the human body  aging and certain diseases such as cancer  arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  aids and certain other infectious diseases 
we have a wide variety of products  including immunoassay and elisa test kits  immunological reagents  including bioactive proteins cytokines  growth factors and adhesion molecules  oligonucleotides  and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies 
we also manufacture and market custom oligonucleotides  peptides and antibodies to the specifications of our customers 
we use recombinant dna technology to produce cytokines and other proteins 
we have registered our analyte specific reagents with the fda and have received a license to sell these products as class i medical devices 
we market these products to in vitro diagnostic manufacturers and clinical reference laboratories as active ingredients in the tests they produce to identify various specific diseases or conditions 
in order to market these products as medical devices  we are required to be in compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices and regulations 
we believe we offer a unique combination of technological  production  and research and development skills resulting in a full spectrum of products and services for the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
biosource was originally incorporated as a california corporation in october  and was reincorporated as a delaware corporation in may in connection with the acquisition of tago immunologicals  inc  a manufacturer of immunological reagents derived from antibodies produced in goats and other animals 
in november  we acquired keystone laboratories  inc  a manufacturer of oligonucleotides 
in june  we acquired assets and assumed selected liabilities of medgenix diagnostics  sa located in fleurus  belgium 
the medgenix assets consisted of diagnostic and research assay kits  and included manufacturing and distribution facilities  research and development laboratories  customer accounts and an existing employee base 
in december  biosource acquired quality controlled biochemicals  inc  a manufacturer of peptides and antibodies 
in december  we also acquired substantially all the assets and selected liabilities of biofluids  inc  a manufacturer of serum  buffers and media 
in  we incurred a net loss available to common stockholders of  the loss was partially the result of a  charge for non cash preferred stock dividends and accretion related to a beneficial conversion feature see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and to  of general and administrative charges that were not indicative of normal general and administrative operating expenses see detailed explanation below in the management discussion and analysis comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december

more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled risk factors beginning on page of this form k 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company has  in gross trade accounts receivable and  in allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the company has procedures in place to adequately review the credit worthiness of new customers and also to properly review orders from existing customers to determine if a change in credit terms is warranted 
a review of our allowance for doubtful accounts is done timely and consistently throughout the year 
as of december   we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
we do have accounts receivable amounts from certain customers as of december  that if their financial condition changed and a significant allowance needed to be created  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results for inventory adjustments 
we review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the company reserves its entire antibody inventory at of its value because the ability to sell its antibody inventory is questionable 
as of december   the company had  of antibodies in its inventory and a reserve for these antibodies totaling  the company will continue to monitor its antibody reserve policy 
additionally  material inventory write downs in our inventory can occur if competitive conditions or new product introductions by our customers or us vary from our current expectations 
deferred tax assets and deferred income taxes 
the company has  in deferred income taxes and deferred tax assets on its consolidated balance sheet as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a listing of the specific components 
as of december   no valuation allowance has been set up to offset any of the deferred tax assets 
the ability to realize these deferred tax assets depends entirely on the company generating taxable income in the future 
the company has used historical information as well as a projected financial outlook to project taxable income amounts 
the company believes it is more likely than not that they will be able to realize these benefits in the future 
a material change in our expected realization of these assets would occur if the ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income is altered 
if our projections involving tax planning and operating strategies do not materialize or if significant changes in tax laws occur within the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  we would have to set up a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets that could materially effect our tax expense and our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of products primarily manufactured by us 
we do have a small amount of products we sell on an outside equipment manufactured oem basis 
we recognize revenue from all of our product sales upon transfer of title to the customer  which occurs upon shipment 
we typically ship to our customers fob shipping point 
we do have customers who order and pay for certain cell culture products and request that we store a portion of the batch for them 
in these instances  we record all payments as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and recognize revenue upon shipment of the product to the customer 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with this guidance and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not anticipate any changes to our revenue recognition and shipping policies in the future 
long lived assets 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  it is our policy  and in accordance with sfas no 
 to account for long lived assets  including intangibles  at amortized cost 
as part of an ongoing review of the valuation and amortization of long lived assets  management assesses the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates that long lived assets will not be recoverable  as determined by a non discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining amortization period  the carrying value of the company s long lived assets would be reduced to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
as a result  we have determined that our long lived assets are not impaired as of december  and goodwill 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives was approximately   and  for fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
effective january   the company s goodwill and other intangible assets will be accounted for under sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company is in the process of quantifying the anticipated impact of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 which is expected to be significant 
the impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life resulting from the adoption of sfas would be non operational in nature and reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of the related tax impact 
consolidated results of operations the selected data presented below under the caption consolidated statement of operations data presented as a percentage of sales for each of the years ended december   and are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the company

in local currency  european sales grew  or compared to the prior year 
european sales grew primarily due to increased sales in assays and signal transduction products 
sales in the rest of the world decreased from to due to the transition to a new major distributor in the first quarter of and to a delayed renegotiation of a distributor agreement in japan 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was  resulting in a gross margin of  compared to a gross profit of  and a gross margin of for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin for the year ended december  was due to in part to the company s relocation of its primary manufacturing and corporate headquarters in may of  moving from a previously owned  square foot building to a leased  square foot building causing the gross margin to be affected by a full year of higher on going costs in the new facility compared to seven months of higher on going costs in also  our serum and media gross margin  which represents approximately of our gross margin  was negatively impacted by increased raw material costs due to a lower supply of certain material in compared to which contributed to the lower gross margins in compared to this trend may continue in  which could result in lower gross margins on our serum and media products in compared to in addition  the product mix of sales in compared to contributed to our gross margin reduction 
oligonucleotides  as a percentage of total sales increased slightly from to and have traditionally had lower margins than assays  which represent the largest portion of our sales and generate a higher margin 
new oligonuceotide products are now being discovered  manufactured and accepted by customers that produce higher margins than traditional oligonuceotides 
our oligonucleotide sales may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter in and beyond  and  depending on the product mix  could have an effect on our gross margins

recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives was approximately   and  for fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
the company is in the process of quantifying the anticipated financial statement impact of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 which is expected to be material 
the impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life resulting from the adoption of sfas would be non operational in nature and reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of the related tax impact 
the company will adopt of sfas effective january  in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the financial position or results from operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report before purchasing shares of our common stock 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
if any of the following events or outcomes actually occur  our business  operating results and financial condition would likely suffer 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to purchase our common stock 
risks related to our business failure to manage our growth and expansion could impair our business 
we historically have sought  and will continue to seek  to increase our sales and profitability primarily through the acquisition or internal development of new product lines  additional customers and new businesses 
our historical revenue growth is primarily attributable to our acquisitions and new product development and  to a lesser extent  to increased revenues from our existing products 
we expect that future acquisitions  if successfully consummated  will create increased working capital requirements  which will likely precede by several months any material contribution of an acquisition to our net income 
our ability to achieve our expansion objectives and to manage our growth effectively and profitably depends upon a variety of factors  including o our ability to internally develop new products  o our ability to make profitable acquisitions  o integration of new facilities into existing operations  o hiring  training and retention of qualified personnel  o establishment of new relationships or expansion of existing relationships with customers and suppliers  and o availability of capital 
in addition  the implementation of our growth strategy will place significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increased demands on our financial systems and controls 
our ability to manage our growth successfully will require us to continue to improve and expand these resources  systems and controls 
if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our historic rate of growth will continue  that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 
we cannot guarantee that our future acquisitions will be successful 
we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies which have significantly greater financial and management resources than us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or investment opportunities will be identified  that any of these transactions can be consummated  or that  if acquired  these new businesses can be integrated successfully and profitably into our operations 
these acquisitions and investments may also require a significant allocation of resources  which will reduce our ability to focus on the other portions of our business  including many of the factors listed in the prior risk factor 
reduction or delays in research and development budgets and in government funding may negatively impact our sales 
our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions and government and private laboratories 
fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
research and development budgets fluctuate due to numerous factors that are outside our control and are difficult to predict  including changes in available resources  spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies 
our business could be seriously damaged by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions or government and private laboratories 
a significant portion of our sales has been to researchers  universities  government laboratories and private foundations whose funding is dependent upon grants from government agencies such as the us national institutes of health and similar domestic and international agencies 
although the level of research funding has increased during the past several years  we cannot assure that this trend will continue 
government funding of research and development is subject to the political process  which is inherently fluid and unpredictable 
our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals 
also  government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities 
a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could seriously damage our business 
many of our customers receive funds from approved grants at particular times of the year  as determined by the federal government 
grants have  in the past  been frozen for extended periods or have otherwise become unavailable to various institutions without advance notice 
the timing of the receipt of grant funds affects the timing of purchase decisions by our customers and  as a result  can cause fluctuations in our sales and operating results 
we rely on raw materials and specialized equipment for our manufacturing  which we may not always be able to obtain on favorable terms 
our manufacturing process relies on the continued availability of high quality raw materials and specialized equipment 
it is possible that a change in vendors  or in the quality of the raw materials supplied to us  could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing process and  ultimately  on the sale of our finished products 
we have from time to time experienced a disruption in the quality or availability of key raw materials  which has created minor delays in our ability to fill orders for specific test kits 
this could occur again in the future  resulting in significant delays  and could have a detrimental impact on the sale of our products and our results of operations 
in addition  we rely on highly specialized manufacturing equipment that if damaged or disabled could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products and therefore negatively impact our business 
our ability to raise the capital necessary to expand our business is uncertain 
in the future  in order to expand our business through internal development or acquisitions  we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  research and development financings or collaborative relationships 
however  this additional funding may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on economically reasonable terms 
in addition  any additional funding may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or obtain funds through collaborative partners that may require us to release material rights to our products 
our research and development efforts for new products may be unsuccessful 
we incur significant research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies 
there can be no assurance that any of these products or technologies will be successfully developed or that if developed  will be commercially successful 
in the event that we are unable to develop commercialized products from our research and development efforts or we are unable or unwilling to allocate amounts beyond our currently anticipated research and development investment  we could lose our entire investment in these new products and technologies 
any failure to translate research and development expenditures into successful new product introductions could have an adverse effect on our business 
failure to license new technologies could impair our new product development 
our business model of providing products to researchers working on a variety of genetic projects requires us to develop a wide spectrum of products 
to generate broad product lines it is advantageous to sometimes license technologies from others rather than depending exclusively on our own employees 
as a result  we believe our ability to license new technologies from third parties is and will continue to be important to our ability to offer new products 
in addition  from time to time we are notified or become aware of patents held by third parties that are related to technologies we are selling or may sell in the future 
after a review of these patents  we may decide to obtain a license for these technologies from these third parties or discontinue the products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully identify new technologies developed by others 
even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest  we may not be able to negotiate a license on favorable terms  or at all 
if we lose the rights to patented technology  we may need to discontinue selling certain products or redesign our products  and we may lose a competitive advantage 
potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share for certain products 
our licenses typically subject us to various commercialization  sublicensing  minimum payment  and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could lose important rights under a license 
in addition  certain rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control 
for example  the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons  including invalidity of the licensed patent 
we do not always receive significant indemnification from a licensor against third party claims of intellectual property infringement 
we are currently in the process of negotiating several of these licenses and expect that we will also negotiate these types of licenses in the future 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to negotiate these licenses on favorable terms  or at all 
our future success depends on the timely introduction of new products and the acceptance of these new products in the marketplace 
our ability to gain access to technologies needed for new products and services also depends in part on our ability to convince licensors that we can successfully commercialize their inventions 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to identify new technologies developed by others 
even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest  we may not be able to negotiate a license on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to introduce new products  or our new products are not accepted by potential customers  we may lose market share 
rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions are typical for the markets we serve 
our future success will depend in part on continuous  timely development and introduction of new products that address evolving market requirements 
we believe successful new product introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product  and then are reluctant to switch 
to the extent we fail to introduce new and innovative products  we may lose market share to our competitors  which will be difficult or impossible to regain 
any inability  for technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or damage our business 
in the past we have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  delays in the development and introduction of products 
we cannot assure that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in life sciences research  or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products include o availability  quality and price relative to competitive products  o the timing of introduction of the product relative to competitive products  o customers opinion of the products utility  o ease of use  o consistency with prior practices  o scientists opinion of the product s usefulness  o citation of the product in published research  and o general trends in life sciences research 
the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the development  introduction and marketing of innovative products in our rapidly evolving markets will require significant sustained investment 
we cannot assure their cash from operations or other sources will be sufficient to meet these ongoing requirements 
failure to attract and retain qualified scientific or production personnel or loss of key management or key personnel could hurt our business 
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to perform research and development work and product manufacturing is critical to our success 
because the industry in which we compete is very competitive  we face significant challenges attracting and retaining this qualified personnel base 
although we believe we have been and will be able to attract and retain these personnel  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully attract qualified personnel 
in addition  our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as clinical testing  government approvals  production and marketing  will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to attract and retain these personnel or  alternatively  to develop this expertise internally would adversely affect our business 
we generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time 
our success also will continue to depend to a significant extent on the members of our management team and  in particular  on our chief executive officer and president  leonard m 
hendrickson 
we do not maintain any key man insurance policies regarding any of these individuals 
we may not be able to retain the services of our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified members to management in the future 
the loss of services of mr 
hendrickson  or of any of our other key management or employees  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
many of our customers are obtaining our products through new distribution channels and methods that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
a number of our customers have developed purchasing initiatives to reduce the number of vendors they purchase from in order to lower their supply costs 
in some cases  these customers have established agreements with large distributors which include discounts and the distributors direct involvement with the purchasing process 
for similar reasons  many larger customers  including the federal government  have special pricing arrangements  including blanket purchase agreements 
these agreements may limit our pricing flexibility with respect to our products  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we accept and process some orders through our internet website  we also implement sales through a third party internet vendor 
internet sales through third parties will negatively impact our gross margins because we pay commission on these internet sales 
on the other hand  if we do not enter into arrangements with third party e commerce providers  we may lose customers who prefer to purchase products using these web sites 
our business may be harmed as a result of these web sites or other sales methods which may be developed in the future 
we rely on international sales  which are subject to additional risks 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in  of our revenues in  and of our revenues in international sales can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  o difficulties and costs associated with in staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries  o adverse economic or political changes  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o more limited protection for intellectual property in some countries  o changes in our international distribution network and direct sales force  o potential trade restrictions  exchange controls and import and export licensing requirements  o problems in collecting accounts receivable  and o potentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structure 
we intend to continue to generate revenues from sales outside north america in the future 
future distribution of our products outside north america also may be subject to greater governmental regulation 
these regulations  which include requirements for approvals or clearance to market  additional time required for regulatory review and sanctions imposed for violations  as well as the other risks indicated in the bullets listed above  vary by country 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the countries in which we currently sell our products or in countries where we may sell our products in the future 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
we also depend on third party distributors for a material portion of our international sales 
if we lose or suffer any significant reduction in sales to any material distributor  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  approximately of our sales are made in foreign currencies  primarily belgian francs  british pounds  and german marks 
although a significant portion of the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business is currently  or may in the future be  denominated in euros as a result of the european monetary union  we are not certain about the effect of the euro on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the past  gains and losses on the collection of our accounts receivable arising from international operations have contributed to negative fluctuations in our results of operations 
in general  increases in the exchange rate of the united states dollar to foreign currencies cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in those countries  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in some cases 
we historically have not  and currently are not  using hedging transactions or other means to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which many of our sales are made 
our operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results may vary significantly quarter to quarter and from year to year as a result of a variety of factors 
these factors include o level of demand for our products  o changes in our customer and product mix  o timing of acquisitions and investments in infrastructure  o competitive conditions  o timing and extent of intellectual property litigation  o exchange rate fluctuations  and o general economic conditions 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
additionally  if our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet the expectations of security analysts or others  the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our continued investment in product development and sales and marketing are significantly ongoing expenses 
if revenue in a particular period falls short of expectations  we may not be able to reduce significantly our expenditures for that period  which would materially adversely affect the operating results for that period 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as a component of our success 
we rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property 
effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available 
we cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property  especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  our third party confidentiality agreements can be breached and  if they are  there may not be an adequate remedy available to us 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive position 
intellectual property or other litigation could harm our business 
litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is extensive in the biotechnology industry 
we are aware that patents have been applied for  and in some cases issued to others  claiming technologies that are closely related to ours 
as a result  and in part due to the ambiguities and evolving nature of intellectual property law  we periodically receive notices of potential infringement of patents held by others 
although to date we have successfully resolved these types of claims  we may not be able to do so in the future 
in the event of an intellectual property dispute  we may be forced to litigate 
this litigation could involve proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office or the international trade commission  as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties 
intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive  and these expenses  as well as the consequences should we not prevail  could seriously harm our business 
if a third party claimed an intellectual property right to technology we use  we might need to discontinue an important product or product line  alter our products and processes  pay license fees or cease our affected business activities 
although we might under these circumstances attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  other substantial  complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management 
for example  lawsuits by employees  stockholders  collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business 
disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in our industry  and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court 
accidents related to hazardous materials could adversely affect our business 
portions of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
although we believe our safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state  local and foreign regulations  the risk of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for any damages that result  which could seriously damage our business and results of operations 
our sales are subject to seasonality  which means that we have less revenue in some months 
we experience a slowing of sales in europe during the summer months and worldwide during the christmas holidays 
generally  our fourth quarter revenues are lower than our revenues in each of the first three quarters of the year 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet expectations or those of public market analysts  which could result in reductions in the market price of our common stock 
potential product liability claims could affect our earnings and financial condition 
we face a potential risk of liability claims based on our products and services  and we have faced such claims in the past 
we carry product liability insurance coverage which is limited in scope and amount but which we believe to be adequate 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to maintain this insurance at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms 
we also cannot assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect us against a product liability claim  should one arise 
the labor laws applicable to our employees in europe may restrict the flexibility of our management 
as of march   of our employees worked for our biosource europe subsidiary  which is located in nivelles  belgium 
as a result of belgian labor laws  we are required to make specified severance payments in the event we terminate a european employee 
accordingly  our management may be limited by the application of the belgian labor laws in the determination of staffing levels  and may have less flexibility in making such determinations than our competitors whose employees are not subject to similar labor laws 
risks associated with our industry the biomedical research products industry is very competitive  and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in this industry in the future 
we are engaged in a segment of the biomedical research products industry that is highly competitive 
we compete with many other suppliers and new competitors continue to enter the markets 
many of our competitors  both in the united states and elsewhere  are major pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  and many of them have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs  and facilities than we do 
any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the products that we have or may develop and may also be more successful than us in producing and marketing their products 
we expect this competition to continue and intensify in the future 
competition in our markets is primarily driven by o product performance  features and liability  o price  o timing of product introductions  o ability to develop  maintain and protect proprietary products and technologies  o sales and distribution capabilities  o technical support and service  o brand royalty  o applications support  and o breadth of product line 
if a competitor develops superior technology or cost effective alternatives to our products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our competitors have in the past and may in the future compete by lowering prices 
we may respond by lowering our prices  which could reduce revenues and profits 
conversely  failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may damage our market share 
our industry has also seen substantial consolidation in recent years  which has led to the creation of competitors with greater financial and intellectual property resources than us 
in addition  we believe that the success that others have had in our industry will attract new competitors 
some of our current and future competitors also may cooperate to better compete against us 
we may not be able to compete effectively against these current or future competitors 
increased competition could result in price reductions for our products  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  we may lose existing customers or have greater difficulty obtaining new customers 
in recent years  the united states pharmaceutical industry has undergone substantial consolidation 
as part of many business combinations  companies frequently reduce the number of suppliers used and we may not be selected as a supplier after any business combination 
further  mergers or corporate consolidations in the pharmaceutical industry could cause us to lose existing customers and potential future customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently subject to government regulation 
our business is currently subject to regulation  supervision and licensing by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
also  from time to time we must expend resources to comply with newly adopted regulations  as well as changes in existing regulations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to disciplinary actions or administrative enforcement actions 
these actions could result in penalties  including fines 
risks associated with our common stock our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  and there has been substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including o fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results  o the gain or loss of significant contracts  o loss of key personnel  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  o delays in the development and introduction of new products  o legislative or regulatory changes  o general trends in the industry  o recommendations and or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts  o biological or medical discoveries  o disputes and or developments concerning intellectual property  including patents and litigation matters  o public concern as to the safety of new technologies  o sales of common stock of existing holders  o securities class action or other litigation  o developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers  and o general economic conditions  both in the united states and abroad 
as a result of these factors  and potentially others  the sales price of our common stock has ranged from to per share from january  through march  and from to per share from january  through march  for additional information regarding the price range of our common stock  see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock  as well as the stock of many biotechnology companies 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company 
if we were subject to this type of litigation in the future  we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and under applicable law could impair the ability of a third party to take over our company 
we are subject to various legal and contractual provisions that may impede a change in our control  including the following o our adoption of a stockholders rights plan  which could result in the significant dilution of the proportionate ownership of any person that engages in an unsolicited attempt to take over our company  and o the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to our common stock 
these provisions  as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under the delaware general corporations law  may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company  even if the acquisition attempt was at a premium over the market value of our common stock at that time 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our capital stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders will continue to beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  based upon the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of march  in addition  these same persons also hold options to acquire additional shares of our common stock  which may increase their percentage ownership of the common stock further in the future 
accordingly  these stockholders o will be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors  o will significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including change of control transactions  and o will continue to have significant influence over our business 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us 
this in turn could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
it could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our capital stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock  based upon the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of march  as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  could exert substantial influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the voting power of such persons may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control  and could affect the market price of our common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to you 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in general downturns in the stock market 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  the return on this investment likely depends on selling this stock at a profit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  including belgian francs  british pounds and german marks  and are therefore subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate movements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are initiated and the dates that they are converted 
we are also subject to exchange rate exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries 
although a significant portion of the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business is currently  or is anticipated in the future to be  denominated in euros as a result of the european monetary union  we are not certain about the effect of the euro on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not currently hedge either our translation risk or our economic risk associated with the exchange of foreign currencies into us dollars 
there can be no assurances that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material impact on our future cash collections and operating results 
our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to outstanding commercial debt 
due to the recent paydown of our commercial debt  we anticipate no material market risk exposure for changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have not included quantitative tabular disclosures
