as used in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal refer to our fiscal years ended april   and  respectively 
prior to fiscal  our fiscal year ended on the last saturday in april 
during fiscal  our board of directors approved changing our fiscal year end date from the last saturday in april to april th of each year 
as a result of this change  fiscal and fiscal were comprised of days as compared to fiscal which was comprised of days 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated historical financial statements  including the related notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this form k 
results of operations our results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated were as follows fiscal revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization expenses restructuring costs abandoned public offering costs operating income other income expense interest expense  net gain on sale of securities loss on sale of subsidiary other income before provision for income taxes and extraordinary items

consolidated results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal our solutions division s revenues increased by million  or  and our printing division s revenues increased by million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase in revenues was entirely due to our business combinations consummated after april  revenues for fiscal and fiscal include revenues from three and eight companies  respectively  acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal the purchased companies after the beginning of fiscal for the period subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
fiscal revenues were impacted by several factors including i the impact of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   which temporarily halted our operations in new york city  ii other related terrorist concerns about the safety of the us mail during this period and iii the inclusion in fiscal of revenues related to political campaigns that occur bi annually 
international revenues decreased  from million  or of consolidated revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of consolidated revenues  for fiscal the decline in international revenues was primarily due to depressed economic conditions in canada and a decline in the canadian exchange rate during fiscal international revenues consisted exclusively of revenues generated in canada 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal this increase in gross profit was due to the purchased companies 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased because our printing division experienced lower margins as a result of i the impact of the september terrorist attacks  which temporarily halted our operations in new york city and created excess production capacity throughout the industry  ii other related terrorist concerns about the safety of us mail during this period  iii pricing pressures from competition  and iv an overall decrease in manufacturing volumes within our commercial printing  direct mail and envelope operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to the purchased companies 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to the significant cost savings associated with our restructuring plan implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal and other cost cutting initiatives implemented throughout fiscal adjusted ebitda 
as a result of the foregoing  adjusted ebitda decreased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal amortization expenses 
amortization expenses decreased from million  or of revenues  for fiscal to million for fiscal we did not have goodwill amortization for fiscal due to the early adoption of financial accounting standards statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased  from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal this decrease in net interest expense was due entirely to the reduction in overall market interest rates on our bank debt 
other income expense  net 
other expenses  net of other income decreased from other income of million  for fiscal  to other expense of million  for fiscal other expenses primarily represents the net of gains and or losses on sales of equipment and miscellaneous other income and expense items 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
during both periods  the effective income tax rates reflect the recording of tax provisions at the federal statutory rate of  plus appropriate state and local taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal our solutions division s revenues increased by million  or  and our printing division s revenues decreased by million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal this increase in our total revenues was primarily due to the purchased companies 
revenues for fiscal and fiscal include revenues from six companies and eight companies  respectively  acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal for the period subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
international revenues decreased  from million  or of consolidated revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of consolidated revenues  for fiscal due exclusively to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar 
international revenues consisted exclusively of revenues generated in canada 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to the purchased companies 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased because the purchased companies generated gross profit at a lower percentage of revenues than was historically recognized by us and due to lower product margins as a result of a change in the revenue mix of products sold by us 
gross profit percentage was also adversely affected by pricing pressures and competition for envelopes and packaging sold by our printing division 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the purchased companies and the additional overhead that we incurred in establishing our igetsmart 
com  inc subsidiary during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal primarily due to the weakened economy  which slowed revenue growth at a greater rate than we were able to institute cost saving measures and workforce reductions 
adjusted ebitda 
as a result of the foregoing  adjusted ebitda decreased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal amortization expenses 
amortization expenses increased  from million  or of revenues  for fiscal  to million  or of revenues  for fiscal this increase was exclusively due to the increased purchase consideration for acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method that was included in our results for fiscal restructuring costs 
during fiscal and fiscal  we incurred expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with our restructuring plans 
our plans were implemented to consolidate our backroom functions into more centralized operations and to consolidate certain of our manufacturing facilities 
the majority of our restructuring costs were related to the severance agreements for our employees affected under the restructuring plan and the closure and consolidation of certain of our facilities 
in total  and employees were terminated under the fiscal and fiscal plans  respectively 
abandoned public offering costs 
during fiscal  we abandoned our effort for a tax free spin off and subsequent public offering of our igetsmart 
com  inc subsidiary due to poor market conditions and expensed certain accounting  legal and consulting fees associated with the effort totaling million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from million for fiscal  to million for fiscal this increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the increased level of debt outstanding throughout fiscal as a result of the additional borrowings associated with the acquisition of the purchased companies 
other income expense  net 
other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during fiscal  we purchased the publicly traded common stock of an unrelated third party for million 
we sold our entire position in the securities during fiscal and recorded a gain on the sale of million 
in addition  during fiscal  we sold all the outstanding capital stock of a manufacturing subsidiary for million and recognized a pre tax loss on the sale of million 
other income also includes the net of gains and or losses on sales of equipment and miscellaneous other income and expense items 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  reflecting an effective income tax rate of for both years 
during both periods  the effective income tax rates reflect the recording of tax provisions at the federal statutory rate  plus appropriate state and local taxes 
in addition  the effective tax rates for both fiscal and fiscal were increased to reflect the incurrence of non deductible goodwill amortization expense resulting from the acquisitions of certain of the purchased companies 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had a working capital deficit of million  which included million in debt under the company s existing credit facility classified as short term 
our capitalization  defined as the sum of long term debt and stockholders equity  at april  was approximately million 
we use a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of our operations 
as a result  minimal amounts of cash and cash equivalents are typically on hand as any excess cash would be used to pay down our existing credit facility 
cash at april   primarily represented customer collections and in transit cash sweeps from our subsidiaries at the end of the year 
our anticipated capital expenditures budget for the next twelve months is approximately million 
we anticipate that these capital expenditures primarily will be equipment purchases  leasehold improvements and related costs we expect to incur in connection with the integration of certain operations 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million used for acquisitions and additional purchase consideration and million used for capital expenditures  which was partially offset by the net proceeds of million received on the sale of property and equipment and million received from the collection of notes receivable 
net cash used by financing activities was million  which was mainly comprised of million in net payments on our existing credit facility and million in payments of other long term debt 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million used for acquisitions and million used for capital expenditures  which was partially offset by proceeds of million for the sale of net assets held for sale and million for the collection of a note receivable for the sale of a subsidiary 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  comprised mainly of the net borrowings on our existing credit facility of million  which was partially offset by million and million used for the payments of short term debt and subordinated related party debt  respectively 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million used for acquisitions  million used for capital expenditures and million used for the purchase of securities and investments  which was partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  which included million in net borrowings on our existing credit facility 
we have significant operations in canada 
net sales from our canadian operations accounted for approximately of our total revenues for fiscal as a result  we are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
changes in exchange rates may have a significant effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to reduce our leverage  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction involving five of our owned buildings during fiscal net cash proceeds to us after taxes and fees associated with this transaction were approximately million 
the entire net proceeds were used to pay down debt 
we have entered into a secured revolving credit facility with million available  subject to certain leverage tests  for working capital and acquisition purposes  including a million revolver and a million amortizing term note 
our existing credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and is subject to terms and conditions typical of a credit facility of such type and size  including certain financial covenants 
at april   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  at an annual interest rate of approximately 
the credit facility matures on march  during fiscal  we incurred million in interest expense relating to the credit facility 
during the quarter ended april   we breached a leverage covenant in the credit facility 
however  our lenders waived our default waiver under our leverage covenant  allowing us to be in compliance with our credit facility as of april   and we agreed to amendments to certain provisions of the credit facility 
under the terms of the waiver  i the leverage ratio from april  through july  was increased to to  ii on july  and thereafter the leverage ratio will be to and iii certain minimum cumulative consolidated ebitda requirements were imposed 
these amendments to the credit facility will allow us to pursue alternative financing sources or otherwise generate cash to reduce borrowings under the credit facility 
if we are not able to procure alternative financing or otherwise generate cash to significantly reduce borrowings under the credit facility in the near future  then we have agreed with our lenders in principle to enter into an amended credit facility 
the agreement with our lenders contemplates that the amended credit facility would bear interest at  mature on october  and provide access to working capital based on a borrowing base formula 
the amended credit facility would also have financial covenants typical of asset based financing facilities 
these covenants  and other terms and conditions of the amended facility  would be subject to negotiation with our lenders 
because the company has not yet reached agreement with its lenders regarding all of the specific terms and conditions that would be contained in the amended credit facility  the existing credit facility must be classified as short term debt under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
consistent with our agreement with our lenders as described above  we are currently pursuing alternative financing 
the proceeds from any such alternative financing would be used in large part to repay amounts outstanding under our existing credit facility 
we currently anticipate that we will be able to obtain alternative financing  but we cannot give any assurance as to when or whether this actually will occur 
we anticipate that any alternative financing would subject us and our subsidiaries to material convenants that would restrict certain aspects of our operations 
we also anticipate that this financing will be secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries assets and guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
because of these restrictions  and because the amended credit facility we anticipate entering into with our existing lender if we are not able to obtain alternative financing also will contain restrictive covenants  the financing alternative we ultimately implement will impose restrictions on our operations and these restrictions could adversely affect our liquidity 
specifically  i our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  ii we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes  and iii our level of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under our existing credit facility 
as of april   the swap was valued at million  which represents the amount which we would have paid to settle the swap at that date 
if we repay the amounts outstanding under the credit facility with proceeds from alternate financing  we will be required to settle the swap at the fair value as of that date 
we anticipate using a portion of the proceeds from any such financing to make this payment 
this charge would be included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the following table summarizes our cash obligations as of april  payments due by period in millions less than years years one year and and thereafter total short term debt long term debt  including capital leases operating leases earn out provisions total cash obligations we lease various types of warehouse and office facilities and equipment  furniture and fixtures under noncancelable lease agreements which expire at various dates 
many of the purchase agreements for our acquisitions include earn out provisions that could result in additional purchase consideration payable in the form of cash payments in future years dependent upon future operating performance of the acquired businesses 
it is not possible to currently predict with certainty the future operating performance of the acquired businesses or the exact amount and timing of future earn out payments 
accordingly  these amounts are only intended to be indicative of management s current expectations for such obligations 
in addition  we also had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to performance and payment guarantees 
based upon our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
we anticipate that our current cash on hand  cash flows from operations and  if we are able to procure alternative financing  additional financing available under a new working capital facility  or if we are not able to procure alternative financing  financing available from our existing lender  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for our operations for the next twelve months 
we also expect that our financing will be sufficient to meet our long term liquidity requirements for operations 
however  we may have to seek additional funding for our long term liquidity from the issuance of additional bank debt  the issuance of public debt or the issuance of additional common stock in the public markets 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our envelope and commercial print businesses are subject to seasonal influences 
both our solutions division and our printing division are subject to seasonal influences of the potential lower demand for consumable printed business products during the summer months which coincide with our fiscal quarters ending in july 
if we continue to complete acquisitions  we may become subject to seasonal influences if the businesses we acquire are seasonal 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in the prices paid by us for the products we sell  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies acquired may differ substantially from those of our existing operations  which could contribute to further fluctuation in our quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or a full fiscal year 
the following tables set forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for fiscal and fiscal the information has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that in the opinion of management reflect adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information 
fiscal quarters first second third fourth total revenues      gross profit      operating income      net income      net income per share basic diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic      diluted      fiscal quarters first second third fourth total revenues      gross profit      operating income      income before extraordinary item      extraordinary item net income      net income per share basic income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income diluted income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income weighted average shares outstanding basic      diluted      the fiscal data reflects goodwill amortization of   and for the first through fourth quarters  respectively 
the fiscal fourth quarter data reflects restructuring and abandoned public offering costs of  and  respectively 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our most critical accounting policy relates to goodwill  which totaled million at april  during fiscal  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued 
we have adopted this new standard and as a result  we ceased to amortize goodwill effective may  in lieu of amortization  during the first half of fiscal we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill as of the implementation date  following which we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill at may  we recently completed our required annual ongoing impairment review of our goodwill at april  consistent with our initial test  no impairment of recorded goodwill was required as a result of this analysis 
we intend to perform an impairment review upon the completion of each fiscal year 
the results of these annual impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projection of future results for our operating subsidiaries and there can be no assurance that at the time such reviews are completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  in june sfas no 
as amended  effective for the company s fiscal year beginning may  this standard requires companies to record all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
the recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivative instruments is based on the use of each derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
effective may   we implemented sfas no 
as amended 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that business combinations initiated subsequent to june   must be accounted for by using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  however  the new statement will carry forward provisions in apb opinion no 
related to internally developed intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that we discontinue the amortization of goodwill 
early adoption of sfas no 
was allowed for those companies with fiscal years beginning after march  we adopted and applied sfas no 
as of may   the beginning of fiscal sfas no 
further requires companies to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 for the disposal of a business 
sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas  the new rules change the criteria to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the new rules also broaden the criteria regarding classification of a discontinued operation 
we were required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective may  we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
extinguishment of debt and accounting for leases 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  that supercedes previous guidance for the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and accounting for leases  among other things 
sfas no 
requires that only gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt that meet the requirements for classification as extraordinary items  as prescribed in accounting practices board opinion no 
 should be disclosed as such in the financial statements 
previous guidance required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items 
this portion of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with restatement of prior periods required 
implementation of this portion of the standard will result in the reclassification of certain losses on extinguishment of debt previously treated by us as extraordinary items 
in addition  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as it relates to accounting by a lessee for certain lease modifications 
under sfas no 
 if a capital lease is modified in such a way that the change gives rise to a new agreement classified as an operating lease  the assets and obligation are removed  a gain or loss is recognized and the new lease is accounted for as an operating lease 
under sfas no 
 capital leases that are modified so the resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease are to be accounted for under the sale leaseback provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
these provisions of sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may  sfas no 
will be applied as required 
adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term debt 
market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company s borrowings under its existing credit facility are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
the estimated fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value at april  the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
on may   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the swap with various lending institutions at no cost to the company 
the swap s effective date is august  with a termination date of march  the company exchanged its variable interest rate on million in credit facility debt for a fixed month libor of approximately plus the company s interest rate spread under its credit facility 
the swap was entered into to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under the company s revolving credit portion of its debt 
this interest rate swap has the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate the company will pay on the million notional principal amount established in the swap 
as a result  while this hedging arrangement is structured to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate increases  it also limits the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
this swap will be cash settled quarterly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
if month libor were to increase or decrease by  the impact to the company would be a savings of million in annual interest expense or an additional annual interest expense of million over the interest charged on million in debt under the variable month libor 
any such change in interest rates would have a related impact on the swap in that a increase or decrease would have an impact on the fair value of the swap of approximately million 
at april   the amount outstanding on our credit facility was million 
pursuant to the market changes in libor rates  if libor were to increase or decreased by  the impact to the company would be an additional annual interest expense of million or a savings of million in annual interest expense over the interest charged on the entire amount outstanding 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are offering million principal amount of senior secured notes to a limited number of institutional investors 
if this offering closes  we will use the proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay all amounts outstanding under our existing credit facility and we will also be required to pay approximately million to the financial institutions that are parties to the swap
