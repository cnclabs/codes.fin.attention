item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary on january  we acquired microanalytics instrumentation corp 
of metro austin  texas and on december  we acquired lab connections  inc of metro boston  massachusetts 
in october  we acquired questar baseline industries  inc from questar infocomm  inc  a subsidiary of questar corporation  which we subsequently renamed baseline mocon  inc baseline 
baseline is located near denver  colorado 
the acquisitions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  their results of operations have been included since the acquisition dates 
sales increased in compared to  while net income increased for the same period 
our financial position as of december  reflects an increase in working capital of  to  compared to  at december  diluted earnings per share were in  in  and in results of operations net sales were  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in sales from to was due primarily to increases in the foreign sales volume of our permeation products  domestic and foreign sales volume of our weighing products  and the addition of baseline effective october  offset by mostly domestic decreases in the sales volume of our sample preparation products and consulting and analytical services products 
in  international sales increased to  and domestic sales increased to  international sales were of total sales in  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of total sales in we use a network of independent representatives to market and service our products in foreign countries 
the increase in the foreign sales volume of our permeation products was primarily due to increased sales to japan  which we believe was the result of extraordinary selling efforts by our japanese representative in we believe that the decrease in domestic sales of our sample preparation products was the combined result of a slowing domestic economy in and the change to a new domestic independent sales representative organization in  which proved to be unsuccessful 
we are currently in the process of signing up multiple independent representatives to sell our sample preparation products domestically 
several of these representatives have been successful in selling these products for us in the past 
the increase in sales from to was due primarily to increases in the sales volume of our permeation  leak detection  sample preparation  and consulting and analytical services products  offset by decreases in the sales volume of the company s gauging and weighing products 
total sales of our permeation products increased in due mostly to expanded penetration in foreign markets 
we have also introduced lower priced  less precise permeation products in recent years in an effort to increase sales volume  particularly in less developed international markets 
we are positioning our permeation products to address applications outside the traditional measurement of barrier packages and materials 
products have been introduced to analyze high transmitting materials such as fresh salad bags  surgical gowns and diaper linings 
permeation products accounted for approximately   and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
weighing product sales increased in due to increased sales of both our vericap and ab weighing systems 
weighing products decreased in due to declining sales of the vericap high speed capsule weighing and sorting system 
weighing products accounted for approximately  and of the company s consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
we believe that sample preparation product sales decreased in due to the factors mentioned above 
sales of these products increased in versus due to increased market penetration 
the majority of consulting and analytical services sales are to domestic customers 
we believe that the primary cause for the decrease in these sales between and was the slowdown in the domestic economy in  which resulted in a reduced demand for our advanced testing services 
consulting and analytical services increased in over as our expertise in the areas of advance material analysis and specialty permeation testing expanded 
sales of headspace analyzer and leak detection products remained generally consistent in compared to and baseline  acquired effective october   manufactures our gas analyzer products 
their sales for the period from october  through december   totaling  are included in our total consolidated sales 
our gross profit margin was  and in each of the fiscal years ended december   and  which is in line with our historical averages 
the gross profit margin percentage was lower due in part to fair value assigned to acquired inventory associated with the acquisition of baseline 
we anticipate a somewhat lower gross margin percentage in due to baseline s overall gross margin percentage being lower than our historical averages 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in or of sales  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of sales in the increase in sg a expenses from to is primarily due to an increase in travel  marketing and other expenses associated with the increase in sales  including fourth quarter baseline sales and marketing expenses  offset somewhat by a decrease in legal expenses in versus for legal fees incurred in the prior year to protect confidential information of the company 
the related matter was settled in the decrease in sg a expenses from to is primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses associated with the retirement of the company s former chief executive officer 
research and development expenses amounted to  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of revenue in for the foreseeable future  we expect to allocate on an annual basis approximately to of sales to research and development 
investment income decreased to  in from  in the decrease in is primarily due to lower average investment balances offset by higher average investment yields during the increase in investment income during versus was primarily due to a higher average yield on investments  partially offset by lower average investment balances during the company s provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in and and of pretax income in and  respectively 
based on current operating conditions and income tax laws  we expect the tax rate for to be in the range of to 
net income was  in compared to  in  and  in diluted net income per share was 
per share in compared to 
per share in  and 
per share in liquidity and capital resources total cash  temporary cash investments and marketable securities decreased  during to  in addition to funding our operations  we used our cash resources to purchase baseline for approximately  to pay dividends totaling  and to repurchase shares of the company s common stock during the period totaling  depending upon market conditions and subject to approval of the board of directors  we may continue to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market at prices not exceeding the market price 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements  capital expenditures and research and development costs 
cash flow from operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
we have no long term debt and no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  our plant and equipment does not require any major expenditures to accommodate a significant increase in operating demands 
we anticipate that a combination of our existing cash  temporary cash investments and marketable securities  plus an expected continuation of cash flow from operations  will continue to be adequate to fund operations  capital expenditures and dividend payments in the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 which establishes new standards for recognizing all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  and measuring those instruments at fair value beginning with the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after june  statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted the provisions of statement on july   and statement effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  have not been amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  have been amortized prior to the adoption of statement statement requires  upon adoption of statement  that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
as of december   we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets related to acquisitions in the amount of  both of which are subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statement  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating sfas no 
to determine the impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are considered critical to the consolidated financial statements because they require subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible 
the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis would include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
management believes the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsened for our customers 
inventory reserves this reserve is for shrinkage  slow moving  and obsolete inventory 
the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends 
our analysis includes inventory levels  physical inventory counts  cycle count adjustments  the nature of the finished product and its inherent risk of obsolescence  the gross margin of the product  and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history of that finished product 
we believe that the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions 
recoverability of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that expected future undiscounted cash flows might not be sufficient to support the carrying amount of an asset 
we deem an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows is less than an asset s carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
changes in our business strategies and or changes in the economic environment in which we operate may result in future impairment charges 
certain important factors if we experience any increase in the cost of raw materials or supplies  we may experience a decrease in profit margins 
in the past  the overall cost of the materials that we purchase has not risen much more than the rate of inflation  although the price of some of the components that we purchase has increased in the past several years due in part to our purchasing less of such components 
certain other material and labor costs have increased  but we believe that such increases are approximately consistent with overall inflation rates 
we believe that the price of our products and the prices of our competitors products is a significant factor affecting our customers buying decisions and consequently  we may not be able to pass along any cost increases in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that we have achieved in prior years 
the markets in which we operate have experienced minimal growth in recent years  and our ability to increase our revenues will depend in part on our ability to develop new products  develop new applications for our existing products and to acquire complementary businesses and product lines 
the analytical and measurement instrument markets in which we operate have not shown significant growth in recent years 
although we have identified a number of strategies that we believe will allow us to grow our business and increase our sales  including developing new products and technologies  developing new applications for our technologies  acquiring complementary businesses and product lines  and strengthening our sales force  we can not assure you that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or that these strategies will result in the growth of our business or an increase in sales 
if we acquire businesses in the future  we may experience a decrease in our profit margins and our net income 
one of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth with the acquisition of businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing products 
some of the businesses that we previously acquired have produced net operating losses or low levels of profitability 
businesses that we may acquire in the future may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
we will likely have to successfully change the operations of any companies that we acquire in the future and improve the market penetration of such companies in order to achieve the level of profitability that we desire 
in addition  acquisitions that we believe will be beneficial to our business and financial results are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the competition among prospective buyers 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions in the future and any acquisitions that we do complete may have an adverse effect on our financial performance and liquidity 
it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds either through public or private financing in order to finance any future acquisitions 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us and may dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders 
we face risks of technological changes that may render our products obsolete 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid and significant technological change and evolving industry standards 
as a result of such changes and evolving standards  our products may become noncompetitive or obsolete and we may have to develop new products in order to maintain or increase our revenues 
new product introductions that are responsive to these factors require significant planning  design  development and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop new products 
in addition  industry acceptance of new technologies that we may develop may be slow to develop due to  among other things  existing regulations or standards written specifically for older technologies and general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies 
as a result  any new products that we may develop may not generate any meaningful revenues or profits for us for a number of years  if at all 
any reduction in the level of capital expenditures by our customers could negatively impact our sales 
our customers include pharmaceutical  food  medical  and chemical companies  laboratories  government agencies  and public and private research institutions 
the capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
the recent slowdown in the us economy has resulted in certain customers decreasing the amount of their capital expenditures 
any decrease in capital spending by any of these customer groups could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales are generated from foreign countries and selling in foreign countries entails a number of risks which could result in a decrease in our sales or an increase in our operating expenses 
sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in and for approximately and of our revenues in and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
sales to customers in foreign countries are subject to a number of risks  including the following o agreements may be difficult to enforce  o receivables may difficult to collect  o foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  o the countries into which we sell may impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  o fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand  and o export licenses  if required  may be difficult to obtain and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our sales into foreign countries could decline  or our operating expenses could increase  which would adversely affect our financial results 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do  which may provide our competitors with an advantage in the development and marketing of new products 
we currently encounter  and expect to continue to encounter  competition in the sale of our products 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include product quality and performance  price  reliability and customer service 
our competitors include large multinational corporations 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
our current products  products under development and our ability to discover new technologies may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors 
our reliance upon patents  domestic trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products 
we hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know how is critical to many of our products 
proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
we can not be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in the absence of patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
our competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents  or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents 
we may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us that relate to our products or technologies and we may need to acquire licenses to any such patents to continue selling some or all of our products 
if we had to obtain any such license in order to be able to continue to sell some or all of our products  we may not be able to do so on terms that were favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future and any broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include o announcements of new products by us or our competitors  o quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  o customer contract awards  o developments in regulation  and o general economic and political conditions in the various markets where our products are sold 
in addition  the stock prices of instrumentation companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
this market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our marketable securities are at fixed interest rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  all of our marketable securities mature within three years 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holding of these financial instruments is minimal
