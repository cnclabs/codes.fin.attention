item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of hanover compressor company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
general hanover compressor company is a leading provider of a broad array of natural gas compression  gas handling and related services in the united states and select international markets 
founded in and publicly held since  we operate the largest compressor rental fleet in the united states  in terms of horsepower  in the gas compression industry and provide services on a rental  contract compression  maintenance and acquisition leaseback basis 
in conjunction with our maintenance business  we have developed our parts and service business to provide solutions to customers that own their own compression equipment but want to outsource their operations 
our compression services are complemented by our compressor and oil and gas production equipment fabrication operations and gas processing and treating  gas measurement and power generation services  which broaden our customer relationships both domestically and internationally 
our products and services are essential to the production  gathering  processing  transportation and storage of natural gas and are provided primarily to independent and major producers and distributors of natural gas 
the company has grown through organic growth and through acquisitions 
for  the company plans to reduce its capital spending and focus on completing the integration of recent acquisitions 
in august  we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of poi from schlumberger for million in cash  and hanover common stock and indebtedness  subject to certain post closing adjustments pursuant to the purchase agreement the poi acquisition that to date have resulted in an increase in the purchase price to approximately million due to an increase in net assets acquired 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  schlumberger received approximately million in cash excluding the amounts paid for the increase in net assets  million in a long term subordinated note and approximately  hanover common shares  or approximately of the outstanding shares of hanover common stock  which are required to be held by schlumberger for at least three years following the closing date 
the ultimate number of shares issued under the purchase agreement was determined based on the nominal value of million divided by the day average closing price of hanover common stock as defined under the acquisition agreement and subject to a collar of and 
the estimated fair value of the stock issued was million  based on the market value of the shares at the time the number of shares issued was determined reduced by an estimated discount due to the restrictions on the stock s marketability 
the poi acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is included in our financial statements commencing on september  as of december   we recorded approximately million in goodwill related to the acquisition of poi which  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas will not be amortized 
in addition  as of december   we recorded million in estimated value of identifiable intangible assets 
the purchase price was subject to certain post closing adjustments and a contingent payment of up to million by us to schlumberger based on the realization of certain tax benefits by us over the next years 
in march  we purchased oec in an all stock transaction for approximately million  including the assumption and payment of approximately million of oec indebtedness 
we paid an aggregate of approximately  shares of hanover common stock to stockholders of oec 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is included in our financial statements commencing in april in september  we acquired the compression services division of dresser rand company for million in cash and common stock  subject to certain post closing adjustments pursuant to the acquisition agreement which to date have resulted in an increase in the purchase price to approximately million due to increases in net assets acquired 
in july  we acquired pamco services international for approximately million in cash and notes 
in june  the we acquired applied process solutions  inc for approximately  newly issued shares of our common stock 
these acquisitions were included in the results of operations from their respective acquisition dates 
we completed a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in june accordingly  common stock  additional paid in capital and all earnings per share information have been restated for all periods presented 
in addition  in early in conjunction with a review of our joint ventures and other transactions  we determined that restatement was appropriate for the year ended december  accordingly  revenues  income before taxes  net income and earnings per share have been restated for the year ended december  see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements

the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and accounting policies  including those related to bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  sale and leaseback transactions  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowances and reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets and investments we review for the impairment of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair market value and would be charged to the period in which the impairment occurred 
in addition  we capitalize major improvements that we believe extend the useful life of an asset 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
interest is capitalized during the fabrication period of compression equipment and facilities that are for use in our rental operations 
the capitalized interest is recorded as part of the basis of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas that relate to our business  one of which is publicly traded and may experience volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset may need to be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
sale and leaseback transactions since  we have entered into five sale and leaseback transactions of compression equipment with special purpose entities 
sale and leaseback transactions of compression equipment are evaluated for lease classification in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these special purpose entities are not included in our consolidated financial statements when the owners of the special purpose entities have made a substantial residual equity investment of at least three percent of the total capital of the entity that is at risk during the entire term of the lease 
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to 
estimate the remaining life of the asset at lease inception  
estimate the fair market value of the asset at lease inception  
estimate the leased equipment s residual value at the end of the lease  
estimate certain costs to be incurred by us in connection with the lease  
estimate the present value of the lease payments under the lease  and 
confirm that the substantial residual equity investment  of at least three percent of the total capital of the entity continues to be at risk during the entire term of the lease 
if these estimates were materially incorrect  we could be required to include the special purpose entities and the related compression equipment and debt in our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates were correct  however  if we were required to consolidate the special purpose entities as of december   we would add approximately  million in compressor equipment and approximately  million in debt to our balance sheet and we would reverse million of the deferred gains which were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the transactions 
in addition  because we sold the compressors to the lessors  our depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also believe that these transactions had the effect of decreasing interest expense 
however  we believe the decreased interest expense and the increased leasing expense are not directly comparable because the duration of our operating leases are longer than the maturity of our revolving line of credit 
see leasing transactions in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on these sale and leaseback transactions 
revenue recognition percentage of completion accounting we recognize revenue and profit for our fabrication operations as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made and since the projects usually last several months 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the average duration of these projects is four to six months 
as of december   we had recognized million of revenue  million in billings and million of gross profit based on percentage of completion accounting for projects which were not yet complete 
we estimate percentage of completion for compressor and processing equipment fabrication on a direct labor hour to total labor hour basis 
this requires management to estimate the number of total labor hours required for each project and to estimate the profit expected on the project 
production equipment fabrication percentage of completion is estimated using the cost to total cost basis 
this requires us to estimate the number of total costs labor and materials required to complete each project 
since we have many fabrication projects in process at any given time  we do not believe that materially different results would be achieved if different estimates  assumptions  or conditions were used on any single project 
contingencies and litigation in the ordinary course of business we are involved in various pending or threatened legal actions 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions  we are required to record a loss during the period in which we  based on our experience  believe a contingency is likely to result in a financial loss to us 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our total revenues increased by million  or  to  million during the year ended december  from million during the increase in revenues resulted from growth in horsepower of our natural gas compressor rental fleet  organic growth in our fabrication business and outsourcing businesses  which includes compression  gas treating  process measurement and power generation  as well as growth due to business acquisitions completed in and revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during domestic revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase in both domestic and international rental revenue resulted from expansion of our rental fleet and business acquisitions completed in and at december  the compressor rental fleet consisted of approximately  horsepower  a increase over the  horsepower in the rental fleet at december  domestically  the rental fleet increased by  horsepower  or  during and internationally by  horsepower  or 
the increase in both domestic and international rental revenues resulted primarily from expansion of our rental fleet 
revenue from parts  service and used equipment increased by million  or to million during from million during this increase is due in part to an increase in our marketing focus for this business segment  as well as expansion of business activities through acquisitions 
approximately of the increase in parts  service and used equipment revenues resulted from business acquisitions 
revenues from compressor fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during approximately of this increase is due to the acquisition of dresser rand company s compression service division in september and poi acquisition in august during  an aggregate of approximately  horsepower of compression equipment was fabricated and sold compared to approximately  horsepower fabricated and sold during in addition   horsepower was fabricated and placed in the rental fleet during compared to  horsepower in revenues from production and processing equipment fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during of this increase is due to the acquisition of apsi during june and the balance due to an improvement in market conditions in the process equipment business compared to conditions which existed in equity in earnings in subsidiaries increased million  or  to million during  from million during this increase is primarily due to our acquisition of poi  which included interests in three joint venture projects in south america 
these joint ventures contributed million in equity earnings for which was partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from collicutt hanover mechanical services which decreased to a loss of  in from  in income in expenses operating expenses of the rental segments increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from the corresponding increase in revenues from rentals over the corresponding period in the gross profit percentage from rentals was approximately during and operating expenses of our parts  service and used equipment segment increased by million  or to million  during  compared to million in  which relates to the increase in parts  service and used equipment revenue 
the gross profit margin from parts  service and used equipment was during compared to during operating expenses of compressor fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during  commensurate with the increase in compressor fabrication revenue 
the gross profit margin on compression fabrication was during and during the operating expenses attributable to production equipment fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during the gross profit margin attributable to production and processing equipment fabrication was during and during selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase is attributable to increased personnel and other administrative and selling expenses associated with business acquisitions completed during and as well as increased activity in the our business segments 
we believe that earnings before interest  leasing expense  distributions on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitdar is a commonly used measure of financial performance and for valuing companies in the compression industry 
ebitdar is a useful yardstick as it measures the capacity of companies to generate cash without reference to how they are capitalized  how they account for significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization associated with assets used in the business the bulk of which are long lived assets in the compression industry  or what their tax attributes may be 
additionally  since ebitdar is a basic source of funds not only for growth but to service indebtedness  lenders in both the private and public debt markets use ebitdar as a primary determinant of borrowing capacity 
ebitdar for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in our revenue for reasons previously discussed 
ebitdar should not be considered in isolation from  or a substitute for  net income  cash flows from operating activities or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during the increase in depreciation was due to the additions to the rental fleet which were partially offset by an approximately million decrease in depreciation as a result of the sale of compression equipment into the equipment leases in march  august and october and in august the increase in amortization of approximately million was due to additional goodwill recorded from business acquisitions completed during and after a review of the estimated economic lives of our compression fleet  on july  we changed our estimate of the useful life of certain compression equipment to range from to years instead of a year depreciable life 
our new estimated lives are based upon the different types of compressors presently in our rental fleet rather than a blanket life applied to all compressors  and more accurately reflects the economic lives of the compressors 
the effect of this change in estimate on the year ended december  was a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million per share 
we anticipate this change in estimated useful life will reduce future depreciation expense  based on our current depreciable assets  by approximately million per year 
we incurred leasing expense of million during compared to million during the increase of million resulted from the additional equipment leases entered into in and interest expense increased by million to million during from million for the the increase in interest expense is due to higher levels of outstanding debt partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
translation expense for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to the company s operations in argentina and venezuela 
due to the currency exposure in argentina and venezuela  the company recorded an exchange loss during of approximately million and million for assets exposed to currency translation risk in these countries  respectively 
other expenses during was million  which included a million bridge loan commitment fee associated with hanover s recent acquisition of poi  a million write down of an investment in aurion technologies  inc  a million litigation settlement  million from the recognition of an unrealized loss related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps as required under sfas see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements and million in other non operating expenses 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from the corresponding increase in income before income taxes 
the average effective income tax rates during and were and  respectively 
net income net income increased million  or  to million during from million during due to the increase in revenues and gross profits discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our total revenues increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted from growth of our natural gas compressor rental fleet and business acquisitions completed during revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during domestic revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during international revenues from rentals increased by million  or  to million during from million during at december   the compressor rental fleet consisted of approximately  horsepower  a increase over the  horsepower in the rental fleet at december  domestically  the rental fleet increased by  horsepower  or  during and internationally by  horsepower  or 
the increase in both domestic and international rental revenues resulted primarily from expansion of our rental fleet 
revenues from parts  service and used equipment increased by million  or  to million during from million during this increase is due primarily to increased marketing focus and partially from expansion of business activities through recent acquisitions 
approximately of the increase in parts  service and used equipment revenues resulted from business acquisitions 
revenues from compressor fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during an aggregate of  horsepower was sold during in addition   horsepower was fabricated and placed in the rental fleet during the increase in horsepower produced during resulted from an increased demand for compression equipment due to higher natural gas prices 
the average wellhead natural gas price increased from per mcf in to per mcf for revenues from production and processing equipment fabrication increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase in revenues from production equipment fabrication is due primarily to the acquisition of applied process solutions inc in june equity in earnings in subsidiaries increased by million during to million from million during this increase was primarily due to our investment in hanover measurement services company  lp which was formed in september in addition  during we recorded a change in interest gain of million resulting from a decrease in our interest due to an unconsolidated subsidiary s stock offering to third parties 
expenses operating expenses of the rentals segments increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from the corresponding increase in revenues from rentals over the corresponding period in the gross profit percentage from rentals was during and during operating expenses of our parts  service and used equipment segment increased million  or  to million during from million during  which relates to the increase in parts and service revenue 
the gross profit percentage from parts  service and used equipment was during and during operating expenses of compressor fabrication increased by million  or  to million from million during the gross profit margin on compression fabrication was during and during the decrease in gross profit margin for compression fabrication was attributable to the acquisition of the compression services division of dresser rand company 
production and processing equipment fabrication operating expenses increased by million  or  during to million from million during the gross profit margin attributable to production and processing equipment fabrication decreased to during  from during the decrease in gross profit margin for production and processing equipment fabrication was attributable to the acquisition of applied process solutions  inc in june  which has lower gross margins than we had historically experienced 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million during the increase is attributable to increased personnel and other administrative and selling expenses associated with business acquisitions completed in and the increase in operating activity in our rental business segments as described above 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or during to million 
the increase in depreciation from the additions to the rental fleet and additional goodwill amortization of approximately million from acquisitions was offset by an approximately million decrease in depreciation as a result of the equipment leases entered into in june and during interest expense decreased by 
million  or during to million 
the decrease in interest expense was due in part to utilization of proceeds from the equipment leases which was used to reduce indebtedness under our credit facility and the capitalization of interest expense on assets that are under construction 
we incurred compression equipment lease expense of million during and million during the increase is due to having a full year of lease expense on the equipment lease entered into in june and the new equipment leases entered into during income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase resulted primarily from the corresponding increase in income before taxes 
our effective income tax rate was approximately during and during net income and earnings per share net income increased million  or  to million for from million in for the reasons discussed above 
leasing transactions the sale of equipment by hanover and its subsidiaries to special purpose entities  which leaseback the equipment to us  has a number of advantages over other sources of capital presently available to us 
specifically  we believe sale and leaseback transactions enable hanover to affordably extend the duration of its financing arrangements  reduce hanover s cost of capital and provide access to a source of capital other than traditional bank financing 
prior to our first sale and leaseback transaction in  we financed growth in compression assets by drawing down on our revolving line of credit with a commercial bank 
while highly flexible and well priced  the line of credit represented a short term funding strategy to finance long term assets 
sale and leaseback transactions can reduce refinancing risk by extending the duration of our capital commitments 
sale and leaseback transactions also provide capital to us at a lower cost compared to other sources presently available to us 
lenders to the special purpose entities do not require as high a rate of interest because their capital risk is mitigated by a perfected  first priority security interest in the compression equipment  as well as a residual value guarantee provided by us 
this factor has the corresponding effect of reducing our lease rate relative to an unsecured borrowing rate 
based on our periodic review of capital alternatives  we believe that the cost of our rent payments in the sale and lease back transactions historically has been to per annum less than the cost of debt financing alternatives available to us at the time we entered into these sale and leaseback transactions 
we will continue to evaluate sale leaseback transactions as well as consider other forms of financing for cost effectiveness as future capital needs arise 
we also believe that the sale and lease back transactions represent a source of capital in addition to the commercial bank financing traditionally utilized by us 
this diversification of our capital sources has broadened our access to capital to allow us to expand operations 
in august and in connection with the poi acquisition  we completed two sale and leaseback transactions involving certain compression equipment 
concurrent with these transactions  we exercised our purchase option under our july operating lease for million 
under one transaction  we received million proceeds from the sale of compression equipment 
under the second transaction  we received million from the sale of additional compression equipment 
both transactions are recorded as a sale and leaseback of the equipment and are recorded as operating leases 
under the first transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a seven year period and will continue to be deployed by us under our normal operating procedures 
the agreement calls for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately  under the second transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a ten year period and will continue to be deployed by us under our normal operating procedures 
the agreement calls for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately  we have options to repurchase the equipment under the leases at fair market value 
through december   we incurred transaction costs of approximately million related to these transactions 
these costs are included in intangible and other assets and are being amortized over the respective lease terms 
in october  we completed a million sale and leaseback of compression equipment 
in march  we entered into a separate million sale and leaseback of compression equipment 
under the march agreement  we received proceeds of million from the sale of compression equipment at the first closing in march and in august  we completed the second half of the equipment lease and received an additional million for the sale of additional compression equipment 
in june and in july  we completed two other separate million sale and leaseback transactions of compression equipment 
under the lease agreements  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a five year term and will be utilized by us in our business 
we have options to repurchase the equipment under the leases at fair market value 
the lease agreements call for variable quarterly payments that fluctuate with the london interbank offering rate 
we incurred an aggregate of approximately million in transactions costs for the leases entered into in  and  which are included in intangible and other assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized over the respective lease terms of the respective transactions 
the following table summarizes the proceeds  net book value of equipment sold  deferred gain on equipment sale  the residual guarantee and the lease termination date for equipment leases in thousands of dollars residual sale net book deferred value lease lease proceeds value gain guarantee termination date june     june march and august     march october     october august     september august     september these transactions are recorded as a sale and leaseback of the equipment and the leases are treated as operating leases 
we made guarantees under the lease agreements that are due upon termination of the leases and which may be satisfied by a cash payment or the exercise of our equipment purchase options under the terms of the lease agreements 
the residual value guarantees and other lease terms which are based on negotiation between hanover and third party lessors  were supported by equipment appraisals and analysis 
we believe that the market value of the equipment at the end of the lease will exceed the guaranteed residual values due to our predictive and preventive maintenance programs  routine overhaul practices and the expected demand for compression equipment in the future 
we review the value of the equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in market value may have occurred as a result of foreseeable obsolescence or a decrease in market demand 
if the fair value of the equipment was less than the guaranteed residual value  we would accrue additional lease expense for the amount that would be payable upon termination of the lease 
all gains on the sale of the equipment are deferred until the end of the respective lease terms 
should we not exercise our purchase options under the lease agreements  the deferred gains will be recognized to the extent they exceed any final rent payments and any other payments required under the lease agreements 
as a result of the lease transactions  we incurred approximately million  million  and million in lease expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following future minimum lease payments are due under the leasing arrangements exclusive of any final rent payments or purchase option payments in thousands      and  thereafter 
in connection with the leases entered into in august  we are obligated to prepare registration statements and complete an exchange offering to enable the holders of the notes issued by the lessors to exchange their notes with notes which are registered under the securities act 
because the exchange offering has not been completed  we are required to pay additional lease expense in the amount equal to  per week until the exchange offering is completed 
the additional lease expense began accruing on january  liquidity and capital resources our cash balance amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  primary sources of cash during the year ended december  were net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible senior notes due  million through our public offering of  shares of common stock  million from two sale leaseback transactions  million from borrowings under our bank credit facility and operating cash flows of million 
principal uses of cash during the year ended december  were capital expenditures of million including million used to exercise our purchase option under our operating lease and business acquisitions of million 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of the million liability to schlumberger which is expected to be paid in and is included in accrued liabilities 
excluding the million accrued business acquisition payment liability  working capital would have increased by million 
this increase was due to increases in accounts receivables  inventories and costs in excess of billings  which resulted from increased levels of activity in our lines of business compared to as well as from acquisitions 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in current liabilities 
we invested  million in property  plant and equipment in before the impact of sale and leaseback transactions 
during  we added approximately  horsepower to the rental fleet 
at december   the compressor rental fleet consisted of  horsepower domestically and  horsepower in the international rental fleet 
given its consistently high compressor rental fleet utilization  we carry out new customer projects through fleet additions and other related capital expenditures 
we invest funds necessary to make these rental fleet additions only when our idle equipment cannot economically fulfill a project s requirements and the new equipment expenditure is matched with long term contracts whose economic terms exceed our return on capital targets 
during  we plan to spend approximately million on rental equipment fleet additions  including million on equipment overhauls and other maintenance capital 
historically  we have funded capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash flow  borrowing under the revolving credit facility  sale lease back transactions and raising additional equity and issuing long term debt 
in august  we acquired the natural gas compression business of schlumberger in exchange for total consideration of million in cash  common stock and indebtedness 
to finance the acquisition  we used million of the proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions in combination with the million subordinated acquisition note and million of common stock 
we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowing under our existing million bank credit facility will provide us with adequate capital resources to fund our estimated level of capital expenditures for the near term 
since capital expenditures for are largely discretionary  we believe we would be able to significantly reduce them  after a short period  if expected cash flows from operations were not realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in borrowings and approximately million in letters of credit outstanding on our million revolving bank credit facility weighted average effective rate at december  
the letters of credit expire between and we are in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our bank credit facility and indentures 
further  we do not have any rating downgrade provisions that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
should this occur  we might seek alternative sources of funding 
as of december   our debt to capitalization ratio  including the residual value guarantees under our operating leases  was to and our book debt to capitalization ratio  excluding operating leases  was 
to our bank credit facility permits us to incur indebtedness up to the million credit limit under our bank credit agreement  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness 
in addition  our bank credit facility permits us to enter into future sale and leaseback transactions with respect to equipment having a value not in excess of million 
in addition  the indenture and the participation agreements  which are part of our compression equipment leases  permit us to incur indebtedness up to the million credit limit under our bank credit facility  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness and any additional indebtedness so long as  after incurring such indebtedness  hanover s ratio of ebitdar  as adjusted  to total fixed charges is greater than to these agreements define indebtedness to include the present value of the total rental obligations under sale and leaseback transactions and under facilities similar to our compression equipment lease facilities 
as of december   our ratio of ebitdar to total interest expense including capital and operating lease payments was to the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total thereafter december  in thousands contractual obligations convertible senior notes due   bank credit facility   other long term debt      other contractual obligations   mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities   compression equipment operating leases      facilities and other equipment operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      in connection with the poi acquisition on august   the company issued a million subordinated acquisition note to schlumberger  which matures december  interest on the subordinated acquisition note accrues and is payable in kind at the rate of annually for the first six months after issuance and periodically increases in increments of to per annum to a maximum interest rate months after issuance of 
in the event of an event of default under the subordinated acquisition note  interest will accrue at a rate of above the then applicable rate 
the subordinated acquisition note is subordinated to all of the company s indebtedness other than indebtedness to fund future acquisitions 
in the event that the company completes an offering of equity securities  the company is required to apply the proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under the subordinated acquisition note as long as no default exists or would exist under our other indebtedness as a result of such payment 
we are required to pay million to schlumberger with proceeds of a financing of a south american joint venture  a minority interest of which was acquired by hanover in the acquisition of poi 
if the joint venture fails to execute the financing or such financing fails to be non recourse to us  in either case  on or before december   we will have the right to put our interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger in exchange for a return of the purchase price allocated to the joint venture  plus the net amount of any capital contributions by hanover to the joint venture 
our right to exercise the put expires on january  since we expect the financing to be completed in  this million amount is included in accrued liabilities in our balance sheet 
excludes residual value guarantees 
as part of our business  we are a party to various financial guarantees  performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries  investees and other third parties 
to varying degrees  these guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
the possibility of us having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon future operations of various subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
we would record a reserve if events occurred that required that one be established 
in january  we entered into a facilitation agreement with belleli energy srl belleli  a fabrication company based in italy 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to provide belleli with project financing including necessary guarantees  bonding capacity and other collateral on an individual project basis 
under the agreement  belleli must present each project to us which we may approve at our sole discretion 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the facilitation agreement 
under a separate agreement with belleli  we have issued letters of credit on belleli s behalf totaling approximately million at december  in july  the company acquired a interest in belleli 
we are also a guarantor of approximately million of debt associated with the special purpose entities with which we entered into sale leaseback transactions  which is equal to the residual value guarantees under the lease agreements 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments to minimize the risks and or costs associated with financial and global operating activities by managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuation on a portion of its variable rate debt and leasing obligations 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the cash flow from hedges is classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows under the same category as the cash flows from the underlying assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions 
on january   we adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  effective january  sfas requires that all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged item pending recognition in earnings 
prior to  we entered into two interest rate swaps which were outstanding at december  with notional amounts of  and  and strike rates of and  respectively 
these swaps were to expire in july  however  they were extended for an additional two years at the option of the counterparty 
the difference paid or received on the swap transactions is recognized in leasing expense 
these swap transactions expire in july on january   in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas  we recorded a loss resulting from the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the statement of income of approximately  
per share  net of tax benefit of  during  we recognized an additional unrealized loss of approximately million related to the change in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in other expense in the statement of income because these swaps did not meet the specific hedge criteria as a result of the counterparty s option to extend the interest rate swaps 
further  management decided not to designate the interest rate swaps as hedges at the time they were extended by the counterparty 
at december   we recorded million in accrued liabilities and million in other long term liabilities related to these interest rate swaps 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps will fluctuate with changes in interest rates over their remaining terms and the fluctuations will be recorded in the statement of income 
during the second quarter of  we entered into three additional interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows maturity strike notional lease date rate amount march  august  october  these three swaps  which we have designated as cash flow hedging instruments  meet the specific hedge criteria and any changes in their fair values have been recognized in other comprehensive income 
during  we recorded a million loss  net of tax in other comprehensive income  million in accrued current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities with respect to these three swaps 
the counterparty to each of the our interest rate swap agreements is a major international financial institution 
we continually monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and do not expect non performance by any counterparty although such non performance could have a material adverse effect on us 
in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts can either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement is reached  a preliminary payment may be made based on a dollar to peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also requires the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
as a result  we are involved in negotiations with our customers in argentina as to the currency in which contract amounts are to be paid  as mandated by the argentine government 
we are currently evaluating the full impact of the measures taken by the argentine government 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our ebitdar 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change  and we cannot predict whether the peso will continue to lose value against the dollar or the terms under which we and our customers will be able to renegotiate our contracts 
to the extent that the situation in argentina continues to deteriorate  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  hanover s results of operations in argentina may be adversely affected which could result in reductions in hanover s net income 
in addition  we have exposure to currency risks in venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in us dollars rather than venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the bolivar s value 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our ebitdar 
factors that may affect our financial condition and future results short lease terms many of our compressor leases with customers have short initial terms  and we cannot be sure that the rental compressors will stay out on location after the end of the initial lease term 
the length of our leases varies based on operating conditions and customer needs  as more fully discussed under business above 
in most cases  under currently prevailing lease rates  the initial lease terms are not long enough to enable us to fully recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating the equipment 
we cannot be sure that a substantial number of our lessees will continue to renew their leases or that we will be able to re lease the equipment to new customers or that any renewals or re leases will be at comparable lease rates 
the inability to renew or re lease a substantial portion of our compressor rental fleet would have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantial capital requirements we require a substantial amount of capital to expand our compressor rental fleet and our complementary businesses 
we have made and plan to continue to make substantial capital investments to expand our compressor rental fleet and our complementary businesses 
our current plans are to spend approximately million in  exclusive of any major acquisitions  in continued expansion and maintenance of our rental fleet and other businesses 
the amount of these expenditures may vary depending on their expected rate of return  conditions in the natural gas industry and the timing and extent of any significant acquisitions we may make 
historically  we have funded our capital expenditures through internally generated funds  sale and leaseback transactions and debt and equity financing 
while we believe that cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our existing million bank credit facility will provide us with sufficient cash to fund our planned capital expenditures in the short term  we cannot assure you that these sources will be sufficient 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow  together with the absence of alternative sources of capital  could have a material adverse effect on our growth  results of operations and financial condition 
international operations there are many risks associated with conducting operations in international markets 
we operate in many different geographic markets  some of which are outside the united states 
changes in local economic or political conditions  particularly in latin america or canada  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities include the following 
difficulties in managing international operations  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
tariffs and other trade barriers which may restrict our ability to enter into new markets  
changes in political conditions in venezuela and argentina  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
restrictions on repatriation of earnings or expropriation of property  
the burden of complying with foreign laws  and 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the us dollar  particularly in argentina and venezuela 
as part of our acquisition of the gas compression business of schlumberger  we acquired minority interests in three joint ventures in venezuela 
as a minority investor in these joint ventures  we will not be able to control their operations and activities  including without limitation  whether and when they distribute cash or property to their holders 
acquisition strategy we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate acquired companies into our business 
as part of our business strategy  we have completed selective acquisitions of other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand our business and may do so in the future 
each acquisition involves potential risks  such as the diversion of management s attention away from current operations  problems in integrating acquired businesses and possible short term adverse effects on our operations as a result of that process 
we may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our business  or may be able to do so only at significant expense 
we actively review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis  and we may make new acquisitions at any time 
given our selective approach to acquisitions  we are unable to predict whether or when we will find suitable acquisition candidates or whether we will be able to complete a material acquisition 
depending on the size of our potential acquisitions  we may seek to finance acquisitions with cash or through the issuance of new debt and or equity securities 
industry conditions a prolonged  substantial reduction in oil or gas prices could adversely affect our business 
our operations depend upon the levels of activity in natural gas development  production  processing and transportation 
in recent years  oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity have been extremely volatile 
for example  oil and gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and gas prices 
as a result  the demand for our gas compression and oil and gas production equipment was adversely affected 
any future significant  prolonged decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
erosion of the financial condition of customers could adversely affect our business 
we continually monitor and manage the credit we extend to our customers and attempt to limit credit risks by utilizing risk transfer arrangements and by obtaining security interests 
our business could be adversely affected in the event that the financial condition of our customers erodes 
at times during which the natural gas market weakens  the likelihood of the erosion of the financial condition of these customers increases 
upon the financial failure of a customer  we could experience a loss associated with the unsecured portion of any of our outstanding accounts receivable 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we experience competition from companies who may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and throughout the economy as a whole  more readily take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in this market or against such competition 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
potential liability and insurance natural gas operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability to us 
natural gas operations entail inherent risks  including equipment defects  malfunctions and failures and natural disasters  which could result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks may expose us  as an equipment operator or fabricator  to liability for personal injury  wrongful death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damage 
we have obtained insurance against liability for personal injury  wrongful death and property damage  but we cannot assure you that the insurance will be adequate to cover the liability we may incur 
insurance premium pricing is highly volatile and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at a reasonable cost or at all 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits 
terrorist attacks or responses thereto terrorist attacks or responses thereto could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
on september   terrorists carried out attacks that destroyed the world trade center in new york and badly damaged the pentagon outside of washington  dc as a result of these attacks  the united states securities markets were closed for several days 
we believe that these events and the subsequent military actions have caused a delay in capital spending which has impacted our business 
the impact that these terrorist attacks  or future events arising as a result of these terrorist attacks  including military or police activities in the united states or foreign countries  future terrorist activities or threats of such activities  political unrest and instability  riots and protests  could have on the united states and the global economy  the united states and global securities markets and our business  results of operations and financial condition cannot presently be determined with any accuracy 
governmental regulation our business is subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment  health and safety 
our business is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment  health and safety 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures  including assessment of monetary penalties  imposition of remedial requirements and issuance of injunctions as to future compliance 
as part of the regular overall evaluation of both our current operations and newly acquired operations  we are in the process of applying for or updating certain facility permits with respect to stormwater discharges  waste handling and air emissions relating to painting and blasting 
in addition  certain of our customer service arrangements may require us to operate  on behalf of a specific customer  petroleum storage units such as underground tanks or pipelines and other regulated units  all of which may impose additional compliance obligations 
we are evaluating the impact on our operations of recently promulgated air emission regulations relating to non road engines 
we intend to implement any equipment upgrades or permit modifications required by these air emission regulations according to the required schedule 
we do not anticipate  however  that any changes or updates in response to such regulations  or any other anticipated permit modifications for stormwater  other air emission sources or otherwise or anticipated ongoing regulatory compliance obligations will have a material adverse effect on our operations either as a result of any enforcement measures or through increased capital costs 
based on our experience to date  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as compliance with more stringent laws and regulations  a major expansion of our operations into more heavily regulated activities  more vigorous enforcement policies by regulatory agencies or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations could require us to make material expenditures 
we have conducted preliminary environmental site assessments with respect to some  but not all  properties currently owned or leased by us  usually in a pre acquisition context 
some of these assessments have revealed that soils and or groundwater at some of our facilities are contaminated with hydrocarbons  heavy metals and various other regulated substances 
with respect to newly acquired properties  we do not believe that our operations caused or contributed to any such contamination and we are not currently under any orders or directives to undertake any remedial activity 
we typically will develop a baseline of site conditions so we can establish conditions at the outset of our operations on such property 
however  the handling of petroleum products and other regulated substances is a normal part of our operations  and we have experienced occasional minor spills or incidental leakage in connection with our operations 
certain properties previously owned or leased by us were determined to be impacted by soil contamination 
where such contamination was identified  we have since conducted remedial activities at these previously held properties as we believed necessary to meet regulatory standards  and either sold the owned properties to third parties or returned the leased properties to the lessors 
we are not currently aware of any further remedial obligations at such previously held properties 
based on our experience to date  and the relatively minor nature of the types of contamination we have identified to date  we believe that the future cost of necessary investigation or remediation on our current properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
we cannot be certain  however  that cleanup standards will not become more stringent  or that we will not be required to undertake any remedial activities involving any substantial costs on any of these current or previously held properties in the future or that the discovery of unknown contamination or third party claims made with respect to current or previously owned or leased properties may not result in substantial costs 
concentrated ownership a significant amount of our stock is owned by two stockholders 
gkh investments  lp gkh owned approximately of our common stock as of december  schlumberger and its affiliates owned approximately of our common stock as of december  as holders of large blocks of our stock  gkh and schlumberger are in a position to exert substantial influence over the outcome of many corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  the additional issuance of our common stock or other securities and transactions involving a change of control 
the interests of gkh or schlumberger could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
gkh has advised us that it is in the process of dissolving and winding up its affairs 
although gkh has not advised us of the precise timeline of its dissolution and winding up  we believe that gkh will complete this process within the next months 
as part of the wind up process  gkh will liquidate or distribute substantially all of its assets  including the shares of our common stock owned by gkh  to its partners 
in the event the partners of gkh receive a distribution of shares of our common stock from gkh as a result of the wind up  we cannot predict whether those partners would continue to hold those shares or whether the interests of such partners may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
customer concentration poi  which we acquired as part of the gas compression business of schlumberger in august  is subject to a higher level of customer concentration than we have historically experienced 
poi generated of its revenues in from its three largest customers 
on a pro forma basis  these three customers would have accounted for of our revenues in while our historic customer base is more diverse  the loss of any of the three largest customers or a significant decrease in demand by any of the three largest customers for the services poi provides could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantial debt and operating leases we have a substantial amount of debt and operating lease commitments 
our current debt level could limit our ability to fund future growth and operations and increase our exposure during adverse economic periods 
as of december   we had approximately million in total residual value guarantees that are due upon termination of our operating leases and may be satisfied by a cash payment or the exercise of our purchase options under the terms of the respective lease agreements  approximately million of debt outstanding  and unused availability of approximately million under our million bank credit agreement 
our substantial debt and operating lease commitments could have important consequences 
for example  these commitments could 
make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  
increase our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations because the interest payments on a portion of our debt are at variable rates  
limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  
place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or operating lease commitments  and 
limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
additionally  agreements governing our compression equipment leases contain financial and other restrictive covenants 
failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may incur additional debt and increase the amounts under our bank credit facility and our operating lease commitments in the future which may intensify the risks described above 
our bank credit facility permits us to incur indebtedness up to the million credit limit under our bank credit facility  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness 
as of december   we had million of availability under our million bank credit facility rate at december  
in addition  our bank credit facility permits us to enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to equipment having a value not in excess of million 
in addition to purchase money and similar obligations  the indenture and the participation agreement  which are part of our compression equipment leases  permit us to incur indebtedness up to the million credit limit under our bank credit facility  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness and any additional indebtedness so long as  after incurring such indebtedness  hanover s ratio of ebitda  as adjusted  to total fixed charges is greater than to these agreements define indebtedness to include the present value of the total rental obligations under sale and leaseback transactions and under facilities similar to our compression equipment lease facilities 
significant cash requirements we will need to generate a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and operating lease commitments and to fund working capital  and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make scheduled payments under our operating leases  or to refinance our indebtedness  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to our operational performance  as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our total debt of approximately million at december   we expect total debt service payments for the year ending december  will be approximately million based upon interest rates in effect as of december  in addition  based upon our current operating lease commitments and rates  we expect that total compressor lease rent payments for the year ending december  will be approximately million 
we also expect that total distributions on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities for the year ended december  assuming no deferrals as permitted by the terms of such securities to be approximately million 
we cannot be sure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our million bank credit agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  operating lease commitments  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms could materially adversely affect our business 
characterization of our compression equipment leases we treat our compression equipment leases as operating leases for financial accounting purposes but as a financing arrangement for income and certain other tax purposes 
changes in generally accepted accounting principles related to operating leases or accounting treatment inconsistent with our intent could adversely affect our other obligations  and tax treatment inconsistent with our intent could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we intend to continue to treat our compression equipment leases as a secured financing arrangement for income and certain other tax purposes  which is consistent with how the leases are intended to be treated for bankruptcy law and state law purposes  but differs from the treatment of the compression equipment leases as an operating lease for financial accounting purposes 
if the internal revenue service or another taxing authority were to successfully contend that our compression equipment leases or any of our other operating leases should be treated as a sale and leaseback of equipment rather than a secured financing arrangement  we may owe significant additional taxes 
this result may affect our ability to make payments on the compression equipment lease 
in addition  if our compression equipment leases are treated as indebtedness rather than as an operating lease for financial accounting purposes  this additional indebtedness could cause a default with respect to certain of our other obligations 
a default under those other obligations could adversely affect our ability to make timely payments on our other obligations which in turn could result in a default on such other obligations 
volatility of our stock price our stock price  like that of other companies  can be volatile 
some of the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly increases or decreases in revenue or earnings  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  and speculation in the press or investment community about our financial condition or results of operations 
general market conditions and domestic or international economic factors unrelated to our performance may also affect our stock price 
for these reasons  investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices or financial results 
in addition  following periods of volatility in a company s securities  securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted and has been recently initiated against our company 
this type of litigation could result in liability  substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations 
this statement is effective for all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is july  or later 
all business combinations in the scope of this statement are to be accounted for using one method  the purchase method 
companies may no longer use the pooling method for future combinations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  amortization of goodwill over an estimated useful life will be discontinued 
instead  goodwill amounts will be subject to a fair value based annual impairment assessment 
the standard also requires acquired intangible assets to be recognized separately and amortized as appropriate 
sfas is effective for hanover on january  however  under the transition provisions of sfas  goodwill acquired in a business combination for which the acquisition date is after june   shall not be amortized 
because the acquisition of poi was consummated after june   the goodwill related to the poi acquisition was not amortized in the goodwill related to business combinations completed before june  continued to be amortized in because hanover had not adopted sfas we expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have an impact on future financial statements  due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization expense 
for  goodwill amortization expense was million based on goodwill of approximately million related to acquisitions which were completed before june  the transition provisions of sfas require us to perform an initial impairment assessment of goodwill by june  we are currently performing the initial assessment and evaluating the effect the implementation of the impairment assessment provisions of sfas will have on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets sfas 
sfas establishes the accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
this statement is effective for hanover effective january  we are currently assessing the new standard and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the new rules supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the new rules retain many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 but significantly change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have evaluated the new standard and believe that it will have no material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risk 
we periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million of which million was recorded in accrued liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
we are party to five interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows in thousands fair value of the swap at maturity date company pays fixed rate notional amount december  we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding bearing interest at a weighted average effective rate of per annum 
assuming a hypothetical increase in weighted average interest rate from those in effect at december   the increase in annual interest expense for advances under this facility would be approximately million 
at december   we are exposed to variable rental rates on the equipment leases it entered into in june  october assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates from those in effect at quarter end  the increase in annual leasing expense on these equipment leases would be approximately million 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency risk  although recent economic events in argentina may motivate us to do so  in january  argentina devalued its peso against the us dollar and imposed significant restrictions on funds transfers internally and outside the country 
in addition  the argentine government enacted regulations to temporarily prohibit enforcement of contracts with exchange rate based purchase price adjustments 
instead  payment under such contracts can either be made at an exchange rate negotiated by the parties or  if no such agreement is reached  a preliminary payment may be made based on a dollar to peso equivalent pending a final agreement 
the argentine government also requires the parties to such contracts to renegotiate the price terms within days of the devaluation 
as a result  we are involved in negotiations with our customers in argentina as to the currency in which contract amounts are to be paid  as mandated by the argentine government 
we are currently evaluating the full impact of the measures taken by the argentine government 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our ebitdar 
the economic situation in argentina is subject to change  and we cannot predict whether the peso will continue to lose value against the dollar or the terms under which we and our customers will be able to renegotiate our contracts 
to the extent that the situation in argentina continues to deteriorate  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso against the dollar is reduced further  hanover s results of operations in argentina may be adversely affected which could result in reductions in hanover s net income 
in addition  we have exposure to currency risks in venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in us dollars rather than venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the bolivar s value 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our ebitdar
