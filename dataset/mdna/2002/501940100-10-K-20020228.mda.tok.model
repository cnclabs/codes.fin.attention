prior to october   lennar corporation lennar transferred its real estate investment  finance and management business to the company 
on october   lennar effected a spin off of the company to lennar s stockholders by distributing to lennar s stockholders one share of the company s stock for each share of lennar stock they held 
the following is a summary of the company s results of operations for the years ended november   and after allocating among the core business segments certain non corporate general and administrative expenses in thousands revenues real estate properties    real estate loans    real estate securities    total revenues    operating expenses real estate properties    real estate loans    real estate securities    corporate and other    total operating expenses    operating earnings real estate properties    real estate loans    real estate securities    corporate and other    total operating earnings    interest expense    income tax expense    net earnings    results of operations year ended november  compared to year ended november  net earnings for the year ended november  were million  a increase over prior year net earnings of million 
earnings per share for the year ended november  were per share per share diluted  a increase over prior year earnings of per share per share diluted 
the increase in earnings was primarily due to i an increase in interest income and servicing fees derived from the company s growing cmbs portfolio  ii an increase in interest income from the company s mortgage loan portfolio  iii a decrease in depreciation expense primarily due to the timing of stabilized property sales relative to new stabilized properties coming on line in and iv a decrease in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships from both the company s domestic and japanese discount loan portfolio businesses  ii a decrease in property net operating income rental income less cost of rental operations  primarily due to the timing of stabilized property sales relative to new properties coming on line in and iii an increase in general and administrative expenses from the company s growing business segments 
overall  total revenues remained relatively flat  increasing in  compared to this was primarily due to the timing of asset sales  reduced interest income on variable rate assets and a shift in the mix of the company s investments 
lower interest income is related to transactions that are match funded with variable rate debt  and therefore had minimal impact on net earnings 
the shift in the mix of investments relates primarily to moving investment dollars to asset classes that are currently yielding higher margins such as loans and securities 
operating earnings were generated from the company s three main business segments in the following proportions from real estate properties  from real estate loans and from real estate securities 
this compares with  and  respectively  for the prior year 
the shift in these percentages from to was primarily the result of higher gains from the sales of real estate in  the gain on sale of the company s interests in its japanese real estate loan portfolios in and higher earnings in from the company s growing cmbs portfolio 
there was a million increase in the company s stockholders equity at november  compared with november  of this increase  million resulted from net earnings during fiscal  and the remainder resulted primarily from the unrealized appreciation recorded net of tax  when the company reclassified cmbs from held to maturity to available for sale 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires these securities be classified as available for sale because of the possibility that the company may sell the securities as the cmbs pools to which they relate pay down substantially and the securities get closer to their economic maturity 
available for sale securities are carried at their fair market value  rather than their amortized cost 
unrealized changes in the fair market value of the cmbs are recognized through stockholders equity  net of tax  and therefore do not directly affect the company s consolidated statement of earnings 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  net earnings for the year ended november  were million  a increase over prior year net earnings of million 
earnings per share for the year ended november  were per share per share diluted  a increase over prior year earnings of per share per share diluted 
the increase in earnings was primarily due to i an increase in interest income and servicing fees derived from the company s growing cmbs portfolio  ii greater earnings from the company s participation in madison square company llc madison  a partnership that invests primarily in cmbs  iii a gain on sale of the company s interests in its japanese real estate loan portfolios and iv an increase in net operating income from a larger portfolio of stabilized properties 
these increases were partially offset by i fewer gains on sales of real estate properties  ii an increase in interest expense due to increased borrowing levels and higher interest rates and iii increased depreciation and other operating expenses from the company s growing business segments 
operating earnings were generated from the company s three main business segments in the following proportions from real estate properties  from real estate loans and from real estate securities 
this compares with  and  respectively  for the prior year 
the shift in these percentages from to is primarily the result of fewer gains on sales of real estate in  the gain on sale of the company s interests in its japanese real estate loan portfolios in  higher earnings from the company s increased investments in structured junior loan participations in short to medium term variable rate real estate loans in and higher earnings from the company s growing cmbs portfolio in real estate properties in thousands rental income    equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships    gains on sales of real estate    gains on sales of unconsolidated partnership interests  management fees   total revenues    cost of rental operations    other operating expenses    depreciation    minority interests  total operating expenses    operating earnings    balance sheet data operating properties and equipment  net    land held for investment    investments in unconsolidated partnerships    other assets    total segment assets    operating expenses do not include interest expense 
real estate properties include rental apartment communities market rate and affordable housing communities  substantially all of which qualify for low income housing tax credits under section of the internal revenue code  office buildings  industrial warehouse facilities  hotels  retail centers and land that the company acquires and develops  redevelops or repositions 
these properties may be wholly owned or owned through partnerships that are either consolidated or accounted for by the equity method  and therefore reflected on the company s balance sheet only as an investment in unconsolidated partnerships 
real estate properties also include the company s interest in lennar land partners llp  a non consolidated partnership accounted for under the equity method which is engaged in the acquisition  development and sale of land 
total revenues from real estate properties include rental income from operating properties  equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships that own and operate real estate properties  gains on sales of properties or those unconsolidated partnership interests  and fees earned from managing those partnerships 
operating expenses include the direct costs of operating the real estate properties  the related depreciation and the overhead associated with managing the properties and some of the partnerships 
during  the company sold matured stabilized properties and concentrated on completing the development  repositioning and lease up of its existing portfolio  limiting new property acquisitions 
additionally  an increasing share of the company s newer development and repositioning property investments have been through partnerships  most of which are reflected as investments in unconsolidated partnerships 
this has resulted in an overall lower investment in the property segment for the company 
approximately of the company s remaining property portfolio is still undergoing development or repositioning 
the majority of these properties are pre leased  which will result in their contributing to net operating income as these properties are completed and tenants begin to pay rent 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall  operating earnings from real estate properties were million for the year ended november   compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of real estate  higher management fees and lower depreciation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in property net operating income  lower equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships  and higher other operating expenses 
total rental income decreased to million in from million in in and  respectively  rental income consisted of million and million from commercial properties office  industrial warehouse and retail  million and million from market rate rental apartment communities  million and million from affordable housing communities  and million and million from hotels and other properties 
cost of rental operations decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in the decreases in rental income and cost of rental operations were primarily due to the timing of stabilized property sales relative to new stabilized properties coming on line in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower earnings from llp and a decrease in partnership earnings from the company s stabilized affordable housing partnerships 
llp primarily sells land to homebuilders  including lennar  the company s former parent company and its partner in llp 
equity in earnings from llp may vary from period to period depending on the timing of housing starts 
the affordable housing partnerships typically generate pre tax operating losses  which are more than offset by the tax credits and benefits which directly reduce the company s overall income taxes 
these decreases in earnings  relating to llp and the affordable housing partnerships  were partially offset by partnership earnings from the sale of the properties held by two unconsolidated single asset partnerships 
gains on sales of real estate increased to million in from million in gains on sales of real estate in include million from sales of stabilized market rate operating properties  million from syndications of affordable housing communities  and million from sales of land 
gains on sales of real estate fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of asset sales 
management fees increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to developer and other fees the company received for managing the properties for its partners 
other operating expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was due to additional personnel and administrative costs necessary to support the growth in the overall real estate portfolio managed by the company  including wholly owned real estate and real estate owned by partnerships 
depreciation expense decreased to million in from million in since the company has not been replacing stabilized properties as quickly as they have been sold  this has resulted in a lower investment in stabilized operating properties and a corresponding lower depreciation expense 
the net book value of operating properties and equipment at november  and the net operating income for the year then ended with regard to various types of properties owned by the company were as follows net operating noi as a net book occupancy income of net book value rate noi value in thousands  except percentages market rate operating properties stabilized operating properties office   retail   industrial warehouse   ground leases   commercial   hotel   under development or repositioning office   retail   commercial   multi family  hotel  total market rate operating properties   affordable housing communities stabilized   development  total affordable housing communities   furniture  fixtures and equipment  total   occupancy rate at november  noi for purposes of this schedule is rental income less cost of rental operations before commissions and non operating expenses 
as of november   approximately of the company s market rate operating properties  based on net book value  had reached stabilized occupancy levels and were yielding in total on net book value 
the anticipated improvements in the earnings of the not yet stabilized operating properties are not expected to be recognized until future periods 
hotel occupancy decreased from at november  to at november  on the company s two wholly owned operating hotels primarily due to the tragic events of september  and general economic conditions 
both of these factors resulted in lower levels of occupancy in by a major customer at one of the wholly owned operating hotels 
this customer will be occupying the hotel at levels beginning in february occupancy at february  was back to 
the company entered the business of owning  developing and syndicating affordable housing communities in initially the company s strategy was to retain the tax credits generated through owning the majority of the partnership interests in the affordable housing communities and then using those credits to reduce the company s overall effective tax rate 
however  the demand for credits has since increased significantly and the company found it could generate higher returns on its investment by selling the credits rather than by using them 
the company has shifted its strategy away from owning the majority of the partnership interests in the affordable housing communities toward syndicating those interests 
after such syndications  the company continues to hold a small interest typically ranging from to in these partnerships and continues to manage the communities for which it earns management fees 
the company expects to generate fee income and gains in future years from such syndications 
as a result  the company s investment in affordable housing communities  as well as the amount of tax credits it holds and utilizes to reduce its tax rate  declined in pre tax operating margins for the affordable housing communities are generally lower than for market rate rentals 
however  the company receives its desired yield from these investments after adding in i the impact of lower income taxes as a result of the tax credits and other related tax deductions and ii profits from sales of tax credits to others 
the net investment in the company s affordable housing communities at november  was as follows in thousands operating properties  investments in unconsolidated partnerships  debt and other  net investment in affordable housing communities  as of november   the company had been awarded and held rights to approximately million in gross tax credits  with approximately relating to apartment communities that have not yet reached stabilized occupancy levels 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall  operating earnings from real estate properties were million for the year ended november   compared to million in net operating income from the company s operating properties increased to million in from million in this increase was more than offset by million of lower gains on sales of real estate and an increase in depreciation and other operating expenses

operating expenses include the overhead associated with servicing the loans and managing the partnerships 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  operating earnings from real estate loans were million for the year ended november   compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of the company s investment interests in its japanese discount loan portfolios in and lower earnings from the company s domestic discount loan portfolio business 
these decreases were partly offset by an increase in interest income

during the year ended november   the company funded seven new b note investments for million and four b notes with a face amount of million paid off in full 
the company s b note investments at november  totaled million  net 
these investments contributed million to interest income in  compared to million in interest income in also included million from the early payoff of a discounted mortgage loan 
these increases in interest income were partially offset by lower variable interest rates 
for the year ended november   equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships decreased to million from million in this decrease was due to a decline in earnings from the company s japanese discount loan portfolios  which were sold in april  and a decline in earnings from the company s domestic discount loan portfolios  as expected  due to the liquidation of most of the assets in these portfolios in prior periods 
gains on sales of unconsolidated partnership interests in reflect the sale of the company s investment interests in its japanese discount loan portfolios 
operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in  primarily due to the sale of the company s japanese discount loan portfolios in april  partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the company s mortgage loan portfolio 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  operating earnings from real estate loans increased to million for the year ended november  from million in this increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the company s interests in its japanese discount loan portfolios and an increase in interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended november  from million in this increase was primarily due to additional investments in b notes 
during the year ended november   the company funded additional investments for million  bringing the total investment in b notes as of november  to million 
these investments contributed million to interest income for the year ended november  for the year ended november   equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships decreased to million from million in as expected  earnings from the company s domestic discount loan portfolios decreased million  contributing only million during the year because of the liquidation of most of the assets in the portfolios in prior years 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings from the company s investments in and workout of distressed japanese discount loan portfolios prior to their sale 
in april  the company sold its investment interests in japanese real estate loan portfolios for million 
the sale of these investment interests resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
management fees decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in  due to fewer domestic loan portfolio resolutions 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended november  from million in  primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses to support the growth in the company s mortgage loan portfolio

operating expenses include the overhead associated with managing the investments and madison and costs of the special servicing responsibilities 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall operating earnings from real estate securities increased to million for the year ended november  from million in earnings were higher primarily due to i increased interest income and fees resulting from the growth of the company s cmbs portfolio  ii greater recognition of earnings due to actual cmbs performance continuing to exceed original expectations and iii increased equity in earnings from the company s investment in madison 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in gains on sales of investment securities and ii an increase in operating expenses 
in recording cmbs interest income  the company recognizes excess cash flows over the initial investment over the life of the security to achieve a level yield 
to date  this has resulted in less recognition of interest income than the amount of interest actually received 
the excess interest received is applied to reduce the company s cmbs investment 
the company s initial and ongoing estimates of cash flows from cmbs investments are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to various business and economic conditions  the most significant of which is the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the underlying mortgages 
the company has already begun to receive principal payments from of its cmbs securities  and nine have matured entirely 
actual loss experience to date  particularly for older transactions to years in age  is significantly lower than originally underwritten by the company 
therefore  changes to original estimated yields have resulted  and the company believes they should continue to result  in improved earnings from these transactions 
the company believes these improvements resulted from its success in managing and working out the underlying loans and stable real estate fundamentals 
however  the positive experience on these older transactions will not necessarily translate into yield improvements on newer investments 
during the year ended november   the company acquired million face amount of fixed rate cmbs for million and million face amount of short term floating rate cmbs for million 
the following is a summary of the cmbs portfolio held by the company at november  weighted weighted weighted average average average face interest book of face cash book amount rate value amount yield yield in thousands  except percentages fixed rate bb rated or above   b rated   unrated   total   floating rate short term bb rated or above   b rated   unrated   total   total amortized cost   excess of fair value over amortized cost  total cmbs portfolio   cash yield is determined by annualizing the actual cash received during the month of november  and dividing the result by the book value at november  book yield is determined by annualizing the interest income for the month of november  and dividing the result by the book value at november  this table excludes cmbs owned through unconsolidated partnerships 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships primarily represents the company s participation in madison  which was formed in april the venture owns approximately billion of real estate related securities 
the company s investment in the venture as of the end of the year was million  representing a ownership interest 
in addition to its investment in the venture  the company maintains a significant ongoing role in the venture  for which it earns fees  both as the special servicer for the purchased cmbs transactions and as the provider of management services 
madison contributed million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships to the real estate securities line of business for the year ended november  at least in part through the company s efforts as special servicer  the underlying collateral in the company s cmbs pools continues to perform at much higher levels than originally anticipated 
in recognition of this improvement  the rating agencies continue to upgrade many of the company s bond positions  often to investment grade from non investment grade status 
the improved rating increases the value of the securities 
as a result  in  the company sold six cmbs investments  which had been upgraded to investment grade for a gain of million 
these bonds were originally purchased as non investment grade securities at substantial discounts and were sold at or above par 
additionally  there are a number of cmbs pools in which the company owns unrated bonds that have had significant principal paydowns  leaving only a small percentage of the bonds remaining 
as a result  the company is able to sell some of these bonds or the underlying loans after executing a clean up call for significant profits prior to stated maturity  maximizing the company s return on investment 
in  the company sold all classes of bonds it owned in one seasoned cmbs pool at close to par for a gain of million 
over of the original pool had paid off prior to this sale  which allowed the securitization to be terminated through a clean up call 
the underlying loans were then sold to three financial institutions 
as the company s portfolio continues to mature  it expects these types of transactions to increase 
the gains on sales of investment securities in resulted from the sale of the company s remaining investment in the common stock of bank united corporation 
gains on sales of securities can fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of asset sales 
during  the company reclassified its held to maturity cmbs securities to available for sale in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
although the company has the financial ability to hold these bonds to their stated maturities  it sometimes is advantageous for the company to sell the bonds as the cmbs pools to which they relate pay down significantly and the bonds get close to economic maturity 
because the company may choose to do this  sfas no 
requires all the company s cmbs to be classified as available for sale and also requires the bond values to be adjusted to fair market value  net of tax  through stockholders equity 
as a result  at november   all of the company s directly owned securities were classified as available for sale and their book value was written up to include unrealized appreciation 
management and servicing fees increased to million for the year ended november  from million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of cmbs mortgage pools at november  versus at november  for which the company acts as a special servicer 
operating expenses increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to increases in personnel and out of pocket expenses directly related to the growth of the company s cmbs portfolio 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall operating earnings from real estate securities increased to million for the year ended november  from million in earnings were higher primarily due to i increased interest income associated with the growth of the company s cmbs portfolio  ii greater recognition of earnings due to actual cmbs performance continuing to exceed original expectations  iii increased equity in earnings from the company s participation in madison and iv the gain on sale of the company s remaining investment in the common stock of bank united corporation

equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships primarily represents the company s participation in madison 
the company s investment in the venture as of the end of the year was million  representing a ownership interest 
madison contributed million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships to the real estate securities line of business for the year ended november  the million gain on sale of investment securities during the year ended november  resulted from the sale of the company s remaining  shares of common stock of bank united corporation 
management and servicing fees increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of cmbs mortgage pools at november  versus at november  for which the company acts as a special servicer 
operating expenses increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increased personnel and out of pocket expenses directly related to the growth of the company s cmbs portfolio 
corporate  other  interest and income tax expenses year ended november  compared to year ended november  interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower borrowing levels 
weighted average borrowing rates were at november   compared to at november  average borrowing levels were  million in compared to  million in see further detail below under financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
income tax expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in pre tax earnings  and to a lesser extent  a lower level of low income housing tax credits utilized 
because the level of tax credits was lower in and pre tax earnings increased  the effective tax rate in  including state income taxes  was compared to in year ended november  compared to year ended november  corporate and other operating expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to overall company growth 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the company s increased borrowing levels throughout most of the year and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
the increased borrowing levels were to support larger real estate loans and cmbs portfolios 
the company s mortgage notes and other debts payable remained relatively flat at november  compared to november   primarily due to the sale of several properties near the end of income tax expense increased to million in from million in due to an increase in pre tax earnings 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to for the company utilized tax credits of million and million in and  respectively  to reduce tax expense 
because the level of tax credits remained essentially the same but the pre tax earnings increased by  the effective tax rate in was higher than in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities used million and million of cash in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used for operating activities was primarily due to a lower increase in other assets and restricted cash  offset by lower net earnings after adjusting for the effects of non cash items contributions of non cash items to cash flow are reflected in cash flow from investing activities below 
the company s investing activities provided million in and used million in the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to fewer acquisitions of  and less development spending on  properties and land held for investment  increased principal collections on mortgage loans and cmbs  increased distributions from unconsolidated partnerships and more proceeds from the syndication of affordable housing communities 
these increases were partially offset by increased purchases of investment securities and mortgage loans  additional investments in unconsolidated partnerships and fewer proceeds from the sales of unconsolidated partnership interests 
the company s financing activities used million in and provided million in the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to more net payments made under the company s repurchase agreements and revolving credit lines and more principal payments made on mortgage notes and other debt 
these increases in cash used were somewhat offset by more proceeds received from borrowings under the company s mortgage notes and other debts payable and less purchases of treasury stock 
the company s investment activities consist primarily of purchasing real estate related financial instruments and commercial and multi family residential properties  in part with borrowed funds 
the value of all financial instruments  or the earnings from them  is affected by changes in interest rates 
however  real estate related financial instruments are particularly sensitive to interest rate changes  because the value of the real estate which collateralizes the instruments  as well as the purely financial aspects of the instruments themselves  are affected by changes in interest rates 
similarly  the cost of borrowing is affected by changes in interest rates  and the willingness of lenders to finance purchases of real estate related financial instruments is affected by factors  including changes in interest rates  which affect the value of the real estate 
to a substantial extent  conditions which reduce the value of the company s assets increase the cost of owning them 
the company uses interest rate swaps to reduce the extent to which it will be affected by changes in interest rates  which affect the value of the assets it holds or the cost of debt it has incurred see below 
however  the company cannot protect itself against the effect changes in interest rates  or other occurrences which affect real estate values  may have on its ability to borrow funds with which to finance new investments 
it also cannot fully protect itself against losses it would suffer if  because of declines in real estate values  it were unable to realize expected returns from its real estate related assets or to dispose of those assets for prices at least equal to its investment in them 
the company continues to diversify its capital structure and to manage its debt position with a combination of short  medium and long term financings with a goal of properly matching the maturities of its debt with the expected lives of its assets 
because the company borrows significant sums in connection with its activities  the company could be adversely affected by reluctance of lenders to make loans to companies in real estate related businesses 
difficulty obtaining financing can reduce the company s ability to take advantage of investment opportunities 
at november   the company had approximately million of available liquidity  which included approximately million of cash and availability under credit facilities  and approximately million under committed project level term financing 
additionally  in january  the company entered into a new million reverse repurchase obligation repo line to finance the acquisition of securities and loans 
this facility matures in january and has a one year extension option 
the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility  which matures in july assuming a one year extension option is exercised 
at november   million was outstanding under this facility  although the company had issued and outstanding million of standby letters of credit utilizing the facility 
the facility contains certain financial tests and restrictive covenants  none of which are currently expected to restrict the company s activities 
the company has various secured revolving lines of credit with an aggregate commitment of million  of which million was outstanding at november  these lines are collateralized by cmbs and mortgage loans and mature through january the company has financed some of its purchases of cmbs under repo facilities  which are in effect borrowings secured by the cmbs 
these repo agreements contain provisions which may require the company to repay amounts or post additional collateral prior to the scheduled maturity dates if the market value of the bonds which collateralize them significantly decline 
therefore  if the market value of the company s cmbs falls significantly  the company could be required to either use cash flow the company needs to operate and grow the business or to sell assets at a time when it may not be most appropriate for the company to do so  to generate cash needed to repay amounts under repo obligations 
at november   the company had three repo facilities through which it financed selected cmbs 
the first facility had a commitment of million  of which million was outstanding and is required to be paid in full by june the second facility had a commitment of million of which million was outstanding 
this facility matures in june the third facility is a million non recourse facility  which matures in march  and had an outstanding balance of million at november  additionally  the company has received seller financing in the form of term repos for eight specific cmbs transactions 
these agreements had an aggregate commitment of million with an outstanding balance of million at november  and expire through august in february  the company issued million of long term unsecured senior subordinated notes  bringing the company s total long term unsecured senior subordinated notes to million 
the million of notes bear interest at and are due in january the company used the proceeds from the issuance to pay down debt  primarily secured credit facilities  and for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated notes contain certain financial tests and restrictive covenants  none of which are currently expected to restrict the company s activities 
during the second quarter of  standard and poor s upgraded the company s senior unsecured credit rating to bb from bb and the company s senior subordinated debt rating to b from b 
additionally  during  moody s investors service confirmed the company s senior credit rating at ba and changed the company s senior subordinated debt rating from b to ba significant contractual obligations of the company as of november  are as follows payments due by period less than after total year years years years in millions contractual obligations long term debt  operating leases total contractual cash obligations  at november   the company had scheduled maturities on existing debt of million through november   assuming the company takes advantage of extensions which are exercisable at the company s option 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on or to refinance this indebtedness depends on its future performance  which to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond the company s control 
the company believes its borrowing availability under existing credit facilities  its operating cash flow and unencumbered asset values  and its ability to obtain new borrowings and or raise new capital  should provide the funds necessary to meet its working capital requirements  debt service and maturities and short and long term needs based upon currently anticipated levels of growth 
however  limitations on access to financing constrain the company s ability to take advantage of opportunities that might lead to more significant growth 
approximately of the company s existing indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
however  most of the company s investments generate interest or rental income at essentially fixed rates 
the company has entered into derivative financial instruments to manage its interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates on its debt portfolio 
the company believes its interest rate risk management policy is generally effective 
nonetheless  the company s profitability may be adversely affected during particular periods as a result of changing interest rates 
additionally  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve risks such as counterparty credit risk and risks regarding legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
the counterparties to the company s arrangements are major financial institutions with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
these counterparties expose the company to loss in the event of their non performance 
at november   of the company s variable rate debt had been swapped to fixed rates and was match funded against variable rate assets 
after considering the variable rate debt that had been swapped or was match funded  of the company s debt remained variable rate and of the debt was fixed rate or match funded

as is customary in the real estate development business  the company has provided guarantees to construction lenders that construction of company developed properties will be completed 
it is difficult to calculate the maximum exposure on these guarantees because the amount of any obligations the company might incur would depend on the extent to which costs of completing construction exceeded amounts provided by committed borrowings and capital contributions 
the company is not currently aware of any reason to expect it will be required to make payments under any of its outstanding completion guarantees 
the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing the company to buy back up to  shares of its common stock

in those instances  the company s exposure to partnership liabilities is essentially limited to the amounts the company invests in the partnerships 
however  in some instances the company is required to give limited guarantees of debt incurred or other obligations undertaken by the partnerships or ventures 
for certain partnerships  typically those involving real estate property development  the company may commit to invest certain amounts in the future based on the partnership s business plan

accounting policies in the preparation of its financial statements  the company selects and applies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the application of some of these generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
the accounting policies that include significant estimates and assumptions are in the areas of valuing the company s investment securities and determining if any are impaired  recognizing interest income on those securities and determining if any operating properties are impaired 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company s investment securities are carried at fair value 
the company determines the fair value through quoted market prices if available 
where quoted market prices are not available  fair value is estimated by the company based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using management s best estimate of certain key assumptions including credit losses  prepayment rates and discount rates 
interest income on these securities is recognized on the level yield method  using the yield that equates the future cash flows  estimated by management as described above  to the amortized cost 
to the extent estimated future cash flows change  the yield on the security is increased or decreased prospectively to the new yield 
a loss is recognized to the extent by which the fair value of the investment security has declined below its amortized cost and the decline in fair value is other than a temporary impairment 
impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the present value of the currently estimated total cash flows related to the security is less than the present value of the previously estimated total cash flows of that security 
the company also reviews its operating properties for impairment of value 
this includes considering certain indications of impairment such as significant declines in occupancy  other significant changes in property operations  significant deterioration in the surrounding economy or environmental problems 
if such indications are present  the company will estimate the total future cash flows from the property and compare the total future cash flows to the carrying value of the property 
if the total future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the company will adjust the carrying value down to its estimated fair value 
fair value may be based on third party appraisals or management s estimate of the property s fair value

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s business activities contain elements of market risk 
the primary market risks the company is subject to include i exposure to changes in demand for commercial real estate space in areas in which the company owns properties  or in areas in which properties securing mortgages directly or indirectly owned by the company are located  ii declines in the value of real estate assets due to changes in real estate markets or the economy in general  iii the ability of mortgagors to meet debt obligations and iv interest rate risk 
the first three risk factors noted above are affected primarily by general economic conditions and to some extent by the interest rate environment 
because these factors are not under the company s control  the attempts by the company to minimize these risks may not always be effective 
the company attempts to manage these market risks i through its exhaustive underwriting program  ii through hands on management of the underlying assets and iii by maintaining a portfolio of assets that is diverse by segment  geographic area and property type 
the company will not make any investment before extensive hands on property level due diligence is performed 
for each asset  the company will evaluate the local market  rental rates  vacancy rates and  if applicable  loan and borrower characteristics 
cash flows are evaluated at the property level and loan levels  if applicable  and downside scenario assumptions are stressed 
before any investment is made  it must be approved by corporate senior management through a formal process 
the company does not make passive investments  only investing when it has control over the development and implementation of the strategy for enhancing the value of the underlying assets 
the company does not invest in disproportionately large assets 
no single asset owned by the company at november  accounted for more than of the company s total assets 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the company has an interest rate risk management policy with the objective of i managing its interest costs and ii reducing the effect of unpredictable changes in asset values related to movements in interest rates on the company s available for sale securities 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company employs hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its operating income and cash flows and on the value of its available for sale securities 
the company s approach to managing interest rate risk is based primarily on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
most of the company s variable rate assets are financed with variable rate debt 
to the extent that the company has fixed rate assets financed with variable rate debt  the company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements  to manage its interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates 
at november   of the company s existing consolidated indebtedness had interest at variable rates 
approximately of this debt was match funded against variable rate assets and was swapped to fixed rate 
as a result  at year end  a basis point change in libor would have impacted the company s net earnings by approximately 
to manage the risk associated with unpredictable changes in asset values related to movements in interest rates on the company s fixed rate available for sale securities  the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
the company believes its interest rate risk management policy is generally effective 
nonetheless  the company s profitability may be adversely affected during particular periods as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve risks such as counterparty credit risk and risks regarding legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
the counterparties to the company s arrangements are lenders of the hedged debt instruments or are major financial institutions  rated a or better  with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
these counterparties potentially expose the company to credit loss in the event of non performance
