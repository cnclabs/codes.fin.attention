companies throughout the world reduced their spending across many capital goods categories  including furniture 
the decline in office furniture demand had a widespread impact across contract furniture manufacturers 
we saw revenue and order rates fall throughout the year  first in north america  and later in international markets  as customers delayed and cancelled orders 
revenue declined  or million  to  million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal our polyvision corporation and custom cable industries acquisitions  both completed in fiscal  contributed million to our total revenue for the year 
fiscal revenue was a record billion  an increase of compared to the prior year  and reflected the impact of acquisitions and growth across most business segments  product categories  and geographies 
the acquisition of steelcase sa  completed in fiscal accounted for of total fiscal growth 
fiscal revenue increased compared to the prior year  attributable to the acquisition of steelcase sa as mentioned above and other domestic acquisitions completed in the year 
by taking aggressive steps to reduce costs  we were able to remain profitable in fiscal we substantially lowered our costs by nearly million or from fiscal levels 
the actions we took to reduce costs include a reduction in workforce  temporary  part time and full time hourly and salaried positions  reduced spending on items such as capital  travel and outside services  and facility rationalizations and process reengineering 
lower profits led to reduced variable compensation  including bonuses and profit based retirement contributions 
we recorded non recurring restructuring and impairment charges totaling million in fiscal  comprised of million in severance charges for workforce reductions completed or underway  an million impairment charge on certain fixed assets and a million charge associated with exiting our airborne business headquartered in france 
the estimated annualized savings from workforce reductions including layoffs for which there were no severance costs and other restructuring actions is million 
portions of these savings were initially realized during the second half of fiscal and will be substantially realized throughout fiscal even with the significant cost reduction actions undertaken in fiscal  the impact of lower revenue on fixed cost absorption and the non recurring and restructuring charges identified above caused operating margins to decline 
operating income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding restructuring and impairment charges  fiscal operating income was million 
we continue to accelerate profit improvement projects across the company in an effort to improve margins

the increase in debt helped finance our million investment in three acquisitions during the year 
we funded most of the cost of these acquisitions by conserving cash through lower capital expenditures  reduced share repurchases  lower dividend payments and by effectively managing working capital 
in fiscal  interest expense was million  which was higher than the previous year because of a million increase in debt 
debt was used to fund increased capital expenditures and new furniture leases 
fiscal interest expense was related to debt that was used to partially fund our acquisition of steelcase sa non recurring items impacted other income expense  net  in each of our last three fiscal years 
in fiscal  we recorded million for reserves taken to facilitate the transition in ownership of steelcase dealers  of which million related to one transition 
we also recorded a million gain on the sale of a non operating asset 
in fiscal  we generated a gain of million on disposal of property and equipment  which was primarily related to the sale of two non income producing real estate assets 
the gain was partially offset by a charge of million taken for reserves related to transitioning the ownership of certain steelcase dealers 
in fiscal  we sold customer lists to new dealers in the united kingdom producing a gain of million  sold non income producing facilities resulting in a gain of million and had investment gains of million 
also in fiscal  the acquisition of steelcase sa reduced our cash balances which led to a decline in our interest income of million 
our income tax expense is a function of actual taxable income earned by the company in different countries and different tax rates in various countries  as well as tax planning strategies that have been implemented over the years 
we expect these strategies to result in a long term effective tax rate of between and 
because of our reduced tax liability  resulting from our lower pretax income and consistent level of permanent deferred tax items  our effective tax rate in fiscal is not meaningful 
in fiscal  we lowered our effective tax rate through the implementation of international tax planning strategies 
in fiscal  our tax rate increased due to our acquisition of steelcase sa and the influence of higher tax rates in europe 
net income despite the significant reduction in revenue and substantial non recurring charges  we reported a small profit of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal this is a significant decline compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal excluding non recurring and restructuring charges  net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal outlook order rates in north america  our largest segment  continued to decline until early february of since that time orders strengthened modestly and then stabilized in north america through late april 
this trend is consistent with recent economic data that suggests that the us economy is beginning to strengthen 
while order rates for international appear to be stabilizing  we have not seen any material improvement in order rates from that segment 
we believe that it is likely that the international segment  which trailed north america into the downturn  will also trail during any recovery 
because of the uncertainty in the overall global economy  we cannot provide any specific guidance regarding the pace  timing  and magnitude of a recovery for our industry 
however  we do believe that to the extent that business capital spending recovers  the office furniture industry will also see stronger order rates 
we believe that we will be well positioned for a recovery with new products and more efficient operations that will help us continue to maintain and grow our leadership position 
segment disclosure we operate on a worldwide basis within three reportable segments two geographic manufacturing and sales segments north america and international and a financial services segment 
the north america segment includes the us  canada  the sdp companies and our ideo and attwood subsidiaries 
polyvision  acquired in november  has been added to the sdp within our north america segment 
the international segment reflects all other non north america manufacturing and sales operations 
the financial services segment provides leasing services to customers and selected financing services to our dealers  primarily in north america  and more recently in europe

companies in the united states reduced investments in capital goods during fiscal non residential fixed investment declined over the last three quarters of calendar year according to the us bureau of economic analysis 
this decline in capital spending dramatically affected the north american office furniture industry as customers deferred or cancelled facilities projects 
the decline in us furniture shipments during calendar was the worst in the last years according to bifma 
revenue for our north america segment  which represents slightly more than of our overall revenue  declined for the year 
the revenue decline was spread across most of our product categories and businesses in north america  with sdp revenue decreasing  excluding the impact of the polyvision acquisition 
new products defined as products introduced in the past five years made up an increasing part of our revenue mix  accounting for about of north america revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal fiscal revenue increased over the prior year with growth across most of our product categories and businesses in this segment 
sdp posted a revenue increase of for fiscal fiscal revenue increased slightly compared to the prior year  as growth in the sales of new products and our sdp business along with acquisitions were offset by lower than expected sales on some of our more established products 
gross profit margin 
gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to the impact of lower revenue on fixed cost absorption 
we took action to lower our cost structure throughout the year  which helped us to remain profitable in fiscal these actions included reducing our workforce  temporary and full time positions  consolidating facilities and reengineering processes 
because of lower profitability  we incurred lower variable compensation expenses  including bonuses and profit based retirement fund contributions 
we recorded a million charge associated with restructuring expenses for workforce reductions and took an million fixed asset impairment charge on product lines that will be discontinued over the next four years 
we also incurred start up production expenses during the first six months of fiscal associated with the relocation of wood product manufacturing to a new manufacturing facility 
during fiscal  we made significant efforts to reduce our manufacturing costs by accelerating the implementation of lean manufacturing principles in our manufacturing facilities 
we have fully implemented lean principles on about of our product lines  and we have implemented some lean principles on about of our product lines as of the end of fiscal gross margin in fiscal was primarily reduced by lower profitability on new products  which represented a growing percentage of our revenue  and competitive pricing pressures on some established products 
in addition  we recorded non recurring charges of million related to facility closings  production relocation and workforce reductions 
several factors adversely affected our gross margins in fiscal  including an unfavorable industry pricing environment  lower margins on new products including the cost of introducing and ramping up production on major new products 
in addition  we had non recurring charges of million related to the field retrofit of beltways and insulation materials within installed pathways products 
operating expenses 
we lowered our operating expenses by million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
however  because of lower revenue  our operating expense ratio increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in addition to previously discussed workforce reductions  we reduced spending on outside services  travel and other discretionary spending 
the reductions in variable compensation  discussed above  also reduced operating expenses 
we incurred million in restructuring expenses associated with workforce reductions 
at the end of fiscal  we took actions to reduce operating expenses that included facility closings  production relocation and workforce reductions 
we incurred charges totalling million related to these actions 
these expenses are classified as operating expenses and not as restructuring charges and were partially offset by lower variable compensation 
in fiscal  operating expense ratios remained relatively flat with the prior year 
operating income 
operating income declined to million in fiscal and operating margin declined to 
excluding non recurring and restructuring charges  operating income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal excluding non recurring items  operating margin was in fiscal and in fiscal international year ended income statement data international in millions  except data as a percentage of revenue february  february  february  pro forma revenue revenue gross profit percentage operating expense percentage pro forma operating income operating income loss operating income loss percentage international revenue and operating income for fiscal includes  on a pro forma basis  our unconsolidated operations  steelcase sa formerly known as steelcase strafor

revenue 
most international markets experienced a downturn in furniture demand during fiscal  although the timing and magnitude varied by market 
the uk and asia pacific markets were the first to see slowing demand 
france and germany saw a downturn later in the year 
furniture demand in spain  italy and latin america appears to be less correlated with global demand trends 
as a result  our international segment saw a reduction in demand that on average trailed the north america segment 
revenue for our international segment  which represents almost our overall revenue  declined for the year 
demand for new products remained strong and accounted for almost half of our international revenue in fiscal unlike fiscal  currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on revenue 
we experienced growth in local currency revenue during fiscal  but because of the effect of negative currency fluctuations primarily relating to the euro  revenue in us dollars decreased 
our international revenue outside of europe increased in us dollars during because of increased revenue in singapore  australia and our export sales from the united states 
our acquisition of the remaining of our previous joint venture in europe had a significant impact on our international revenue in fiscal we consolidated the previous joint venture for nine months of fiscal  which led to an almost five fold increase in revenue compared to fiscal excluding the acquisition  our german operations led the international segment with local currency growth of 
however  due to the devaluation of the euro  we only experienced growth of in us dollars 
in fiscal  a decline in exports from the us and currency devaluations in brazil led to an overall reduction in international revenue of outside of europe  which was partially offset by the results of our mexican operations 
gross profit margin 
gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily from the impact of lower revenue on fixed cost absorption in our france  germany and united kingdom operations 
we initiated several restructuring activities in fiscal designed to lower our cost structure  including implementing workforce reductions in france  germany and the united kingdom 
we also began the process of closing our airborne subsidiary  based in france  which generated a pre tax loss of million on revenue of million in fiscal because it takes longer to implement restructuring activities in many of these countries  most of the actions we initiated during fiscal will not be completed until fiscal  and the full benefit will not be realized until fiscal the total cost for these activities that were incurred in fiscal was million 
excluding the restructuring charges  gross margin would have declined to 
gross margins of and in fiscal and fiscal respectively  reflected a consecutive two year improvement 
operating expenses 
operating expense dollars for fiscal remained relatively constant compared to fiscal operating expense increases were related to million in additional reserves for customer credit and dealer issues  and a million restructuring charge related to workforce reductions 
these increases were completely offset by continued cost reductions  including the savings from workforce reductions  lower variable compensation and reduced discretionary spending 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal because of lower revenue 
excluding restructuring charges  operating expenses as a percentage of sales would have been because of lower revenue 
operating income loss 
the international segment had an operating loss of million for fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the segment s operating margin decreased to compared to in fiscal and in fiscal excluding the impact of restructuring charges  international operating loss would have been million in fiscal financial services year ended income statement data financial services in millions  except data as a percentage of revenue february  february  february  revenue net financing margin percentage general and administrative expense percentage operating income operating income percentage return on equity percentage although financial services accounts for only of total company revenue in fiscal  the segment represents a significant part of our balance sheet 
a detailed financial services income statement and balance sheet is presented in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
fiscal revenue increased versus the prior year 
revenue is comprised of lease revenue and financing revenue 
lease revenue accounted for approximately of the segment s total revenue in fiscal and approximately in fiscal revenue from leasing activities increased million because the average size of the leasing portfolio was higher during fiscal than during the previous year 
during fiscal  we saw a slowdown in the rate of new lease fundings  consistent with the decline in furniture demand 
as a result  new lease fundings were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal at the end of the year  the net lease portfolio was million lower than at the end of fiscal we had a decline in financing revenue related to dealer project financing and asset based lending during fiscal the downturn of the furniture industry reduced the number of new projects that required financing  and reduced dealer working capital financing needs 
net financing margin 
financial services operating expenses are split into two separate components financing expenses and general and administrative expenses these costs are classified as operating expenses in the consolidated income statement 
finance revenue less financing expenses equals net financing margin  net financing margin less general and administrative expense equals operating income 
net financing margin increased slightly over the past three years from to 
the increase was due primarily to gains on residual values of expiring leases 
this was partially offset by an increase in credit reserves for our lease portfolio during the three year period  including the reserve for one significant specific customer lease in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amortizable lease origination costs  along with improved operating leverage from increased revenue as our lease portfolio has gained in maturity over the three year period 
operating income 
for the reasons listed above  operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as in prior years  excluding acquisitions  our cash and operating capital requirements have been satisfied through cash generated from operating activities 
as of february   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance our known or foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
in april  we established a million global multi currency revolving credit facility that replaced the existing north american and european credit facilities 
in june  we established a multi currency commercial paper program  supported by our global credit facility 
we began issuing euro commercial paper during june and us dollar commercial paper during october at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million outstanding under the euro commercial paper program  and no commercial paper outstanding under the us program 
as of may   our multicurrency commercial paper program is rated a from standard and poor s and prime from moody s 
our access to commercial paper markets in the united states and europe may be limited because of our current short term debt ratings 
however  our million global credit facility is available for use in the event that commercial paper is unavailable 
in addition  we have available unsecured non committed short term credit facilities totaling million  that could also be used to fund our short term liquidity needs 
our combined facilities are more than adequate to fulfill our anticipated cash requirements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we issued million of year term senior notes in a public debt offering 
proceeds from the offering were used to fund the acquisition of polyvision corporation  reduce commercial paper debt and for general corporate purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the debt placement 
as of may   our long term debt rating was a from standard and poor s and baa from moody s 
total consolidated debt at february  aggregated million 
approximately million of the total debt is related to the financial services segment  which operates using a six to one debt to equity ratio 
the million of debt that is related to the north america and international segments represents a debt to total capitalization ratio of for those segments in aggregate 
cash provided by operating activities year ended cash flow data operating activities in millions february  february  february  net income depreciation and amortization write down of fixed assets changes in operating assets and liabilities other  net net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations increased in fiscal  despite much lower net income 
the increase in fiscal is attributable primarily to substantial reductions in accounts receivable and inventories due to decreased sales volume 
in fiscal  higher revenue led to higher net income despite increases in depreciation and amortization 
however  higher revenue also led to increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the net effect was a decline in cash provided by operations versus the prior year 
the consolidation of steelcase sa also led to a disproportionate increase in receivables because of longer payment terms in many international markets 
in addition  we made significant cash outlays for previously accrued expenses including payments of deferred acquistion payments  year end bonuses  contributions to our employee s retirement fund and tax payments 
cash used in investing activities year ended cash flow data investing activities in millions february  february  february  capital expenditures proceeds from the disposal of assets lease fundings  net of repayments net increase decrease in notes receivable acquisitions  net of cash acquired other  net net cash used in investing activities our primary use of cash in investing activities during fiscal was for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures 
acquisitions included polyvision  custom cable inc and artwright manufacturing 
capital expenditures of million were less than half of the million in fiscal the decline in capital expenditures reflects an increased emphasis on limiting new projects to those that deliver short payback cost savings or support critical strategic initiatives such as product development  while meeting key eva milestones 
we will continue to closely manage and limit capital expenditures throughout fiscal and are targeting a million run rate for the year  net of major disposals 
we expect to fund capital expenditures primarily through cash generated from operations 
we experienced a substantial decrease in notes receivable during fiscal  due to a reduction in project financing and asset based lending in our financial services segment  since our dealers cash needs were reduced by the downturn in the furniture industry 
our financial services segment also experienced a decline in new lease fundings  which fell below the rate at which leases are being repaid 
the resulting decline in the lease portfolio from million to million contributes to our cash position 
we made no material acquisitions in fiscal  however  we did have significant proceeds from the disposal of assets  partially offset by increased capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we generated incremental cash by financing certain non income producing assets through the use of several sale leaseback arrangements 
those included the sale leaseback of our aircraft and of our showroom facility in new york city 
in addition  we sold other non income producing assets during the year 
capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal reflect increased investments in manufacturing equipment  information systems and facilities 
collectively  these investments were expected to improve productivity and safety  increase capacity  facilitate the launch of new products and improve the environmental impact of certain operations 
corporate acquistions in fiscal included steelcase sa  clestra hauserman and a significant dealer 
cash provided by used in financing activities year ended cash flow data financing activities in millions february  february  february  short term and long term debt  net common stock issuance repurchase  net dividends paid net cash provided by used in financing activities despite acquisitions that totalled million  we generated enough cash throughout the year to limit our increase in debt to million during fiscal on june   the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to three million shares  which has since been expanded to million shares authorized for repurchase 
since the plan s inception we have repurchased  shares of class a common stock for million and  shares of class b common stock for million 
approximately million shares remain available under the authorized share repurchase program 
we anticipate that the share repurchase program will not reduce our tradable share float in the long run as we expect that class b common stock will continue to convert to class a common stock over time 
class a common stock now represents approximately of our outstanding shares  compared to at the time of our ipo in february during fiscal  we repurchased million of common stock  a significant reduction from fiscal and fiscal the reduction in share repurchase activity is due in part to a shift towards using excess cash to reduce debt  particularly during the economic downturn

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates and complexity include the allowance for credit losses  warranty reserve  pension and other postretirement benefits  residual values of leased assets and long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our revenue recognition policy 
we use the following methods and assumptions in determining our estimates allowance for credit losses the allowance is determined by reviewing known customer exposures and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio including trade  lease and notes receivable with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
we monitor credit exposure on a monthly basis and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly 
warranty reserve the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a general reserve based on historical claims experience 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement plans 
residual values for leased assets residual value is an estimate of the fair market value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term as established and at the inception of the lease 
we record and periodically review and adjust residual values based on historical experience and market studies conducted by independent third parties based on the following factors economic life of products  type of products  availability of a secondary market  present value of future cash flows expected to be generated from the product  cost to disassemble and move products  and current cost of reproducing the product 
long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  and assets to be disposed of  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
use of estimates we have incorporated many years of historical data into the determination of each of these estimates 
we have a proven history of using accurate estimates and sound assumptions to calculate and record appropriate reserves and residual values 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
euro conversion on january   twelve of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro  at which time all legal tender within the twelve participating member countries converted to the euro 
our primary exposure to the euro conversion was concentrated at our steelcase sa operation  which created an internal euro committee  a pan european multifunctional team to monitor and manage the impact of the conversion on products  markets and information systems 
the euro conversion has not and will not have a material impact on the financial position of steelcase sa nor the company as a whole

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risks and interest rates on debt 
foreign exchange risks operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in fiscal and in fiscal the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to solely isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect on these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we generally do not hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are commonly reinvested locally and the cost benefit of hedging reported earnings is not justifiable 
changes in foreign exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for fiscal relate to the euro and the canadian dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have increased our operating loss by approximately million in fiscal and reduced operating profit by million in fiscal  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
for fiscal this represents of our non us operating loss 
in fiscal this represents of our non us operating profit in and of consolidated operating profit 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one country may or may not be offset by losses from another country 
foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
transaction gains and losses are not material for our company 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our notes receivable and leased assets  our short term borrowings and long term debt 
interest rates are based mainly on us commercial paper rates or libor plus a margin 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swaps and through balancing the notional amount of fixed and variable rate liabilities with fixed and variable rate assets where appropriate 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations for fiscal or fiscal  based upon the year end levels of exposed assets and liabilities 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps and derivative instruments
