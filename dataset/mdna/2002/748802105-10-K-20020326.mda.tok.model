net sales   increase decrease  we believe the decrease in sales is due to a slowdown in the us and latin american economies and specifically a reduction in capital spending by newspaper publishers 
the decline in newspaper advertising revenue has been widely reported  and we believe that the sale of our products have been affected as a result 
gross profit   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is due primarily to shifts in product mix  a higher percentage of fixed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes  and higher production and installation costs for our new products 
we have incurred higher production and installation costs for two new products  the automatic palletizer and gripper conveyor system  as compared to other products that we sell 
historically  the initial production and installation of new products generate lower margins when they are introduced 
nevertheless  costs with regard to installation of the palletizer and the quipp gripp ii  our gripper conveyor  exceeded management s expectations and have had a more pronounced effect on our gross margins than management initially anticipated 
we successfully completed several gripper conveyor and palletizer installations during and anticipate that the experience we have gained will enable us to better gauge pricing and costs in connection with new orders for these products 
selling  general and administrative expense   increase decrease percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expense expenses decreased primarily due to reduced variable expenses  including bonuses  commissions  and warranty costs 
the reduced expenses were offset in part by approximately  in costs associated with efforts by the special committee of our board of directors to evaluate strategic alternatives for the company  including fees and expenses relating to a proposed transaction that was not consummated  approximately  net increase to allowance for doubtful accounts  approximately  of nonrecurring professional fees for tax planning  and a compensation charge of  relating to our payment to several non executive employees of an amount equal to the excess of market value over exercise price of options surrendered by the employees 
research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales the majority of our research and development costs represented expenditures for improvements to the automatic palletizer system and development of the quipp gripp ii 
in  we focused much of our engineering and technical efforts on the custom design and production of customer orders 
cost related to these activities are charged to cost of goods sold as incurred 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in other income and expense net is primarily due to the decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
in may  we purchased  shares of common stock in a tender offer for  and also incurred  in related fees and expenses

net sales   increase decrease  our sales growth was primarily due to improved international sales 
the increase in international sales reflects our increased sales efforts  including the hiring of a sales representative and additional sales support staff in sales for our core product lines  stackers and bottomwrappers  remained strong 
the sales growth also included increased sales of original equipment manufacturers oem equipment as well as increased installation and service fees 
we sell oem products to offer our customers a single source solution for integrated post press material handling systems 
gross profit   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was due in part to improved gross profit on oem equipment sales 
additionally  our gross profit percentage improved due to lower fixed overhead costs as a percentage of net sales 
our fixed overhead costs remained stable in compared to while net sales increased by 
selling  general and administrative expense   increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to lower marketing expenses offset in part by higher direct sales costs and professional fees 
the decreased marketing expenses reflect reduced spending on trade shows and advertising 
in  we incurred higher trade show and advertising costs related to the introduction and promotion of two new product lines 
direct selling costs  such as travel and commission expense  increased in principally due to our increased international sales efforts 
professional fees increased in primarily due to costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value 
research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales research and development decreased primarily due to the substantial completion of our automatic palletizer product line offset in part by additional costs incurred in the development of our quipp gripp ii gripper conveyor system 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in other income and expense net was primarily due to the increase in interest income 
this increase resulted from higher interest rates on our securities available for sale and higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale see liquidity and capital resources below 
general the majority of our sales are made on a contract basis 
typically  we receive a deposit upon the execution of the sales contract 
prior to shipment  we receive additional installment payments 
we normally receive larger orders several months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of our short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  the completion of the installation  and the receipt and nature of new orders 
our backlog  as of december  and december   was  and  respectively 
orders booked in were  as compared to  in it has been widely reported that newspapers curtailed or delayed spending for capital equipment in we believe that the reported decline in newspaper industry conditions principally caused our incoming orders to fall to the lowest level since liquidity and capital resources over the past several years  we have been able to generate sufficient cash to support our operations  pay a special dividend to shareholders in totaling  and purchase  shares of our common stock in a tender offer in for an aggregate of  plus  in expenses 
although  as described above  our operating results in were well below the levels of recent years  our cash flow was not adversely affected by operations 
after adjusting year end cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale to give effect to the tender offer  our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale increased by  in while our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may decline in if adverse economic conditions continue  we do not anticipate that we will be required to seek external funding 
our long term debt consists solely of obligations under variable rate industrial revenue bonds that were issued through the dade county industrial development authority in at december   the balance due on the bonds was  of which  is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet 
during  the bonds bore interest at an average rate of 
on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december   a decrease of  as noted above  this decrease was primarily due to our purchase  for  of  shares of our common stock in our modified dutch auction tender offer in may in addition  we paid  in related fees and expenses 
these amounts did not affect the statement of operations but reduced our shareholders equity 
the decrease was offset in part by cash provided by operations 
working capital at december  was  a decrease of  from  at december  the decrease in working capital was due primarily to our purchase of our common stock in the tender offer 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting polices  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition involving complex installation services  allowance for doubtful accounts  contract contingencies  and warranty reserves 
our revenue recognition policy with regard to equipment sales requiring complex installation services calls for recognition when installation is complete 
because complex installations often require ongoing customer consultation even after a product is installed and is running  management must often make a judgment as to when an installation may be considered complete 
we believe that an installation generally is complete when our customers can use the equipment in their daily operations and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
nevertheless  there is a degree of subjectivity involved in making this determination  which can affect the timing of recognition of revenues and the related cost of sales 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is a risk that credit losses in the future will exceed those that have occurred in the past  in which case our operating results would be adversely affected 
contract contingencies involve estimates of additional expenses that may be incurred after installation is complete 
these expenses occur when additional efforts are required to assure customer satisfaction 
we record a warranty reserve based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty return rates or repair costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
a significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products would adversely affect our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because our cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we believe there is no significant risk arising from interest rate fluctuations 
we are actively managing our investment portfolios to increase return on investments  but  in order to ensure safety and liquidity  will only invest in instruments with credit quality and which are traded in a secondary market 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k  including statements concerning shipment of backlog orders  possible decline in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and adequacy of available resources  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements including  but not limited to  economic conditions generally and specifically in the newspaper industry  demand and market acceptance for new and existing products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  delays in shipment  cancellation of customer orders  and engineering and production difficulties
