item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item  financial statements and supplementary data to provide additional information concerning the company s financial activities and condition 
overview the company designs  manufactures  imports and markets casual and dress men s and women s apparel products  including pants  shorts  suits  sportcoats  sweaters  shirts  dresses  skirts and vests in the united states and abroad 
the company s operations are organized into three business units  wholesale  retail and licensing  each of which offer similar products through different distribution channels 
the company s wholesale segment  which sells apparel products through approximately  retail stores operated by the company s retail customers  is the primary distribution channel through which the company sells its products 
the company s retail segment markets haggar branded products through company operated retail stores located in the company s dallas headquarters and in outlet malls throughout the united states  and the company s licensing segment generates royalty income by licensing the company s trademarks for use by other manufacturers of specified products in specified geographic regions 
critical accounting policies there have been no material changes to the company s critical accounting policies during fiscal  except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventory valuation  amortization and recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  litigation accruals  the calculation of workers compensation liabilities  revenue recognition  and reorganization charges 
management bases its estimates and judgments on the company s substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
if such estimates and assumptions prove to be inaccurate  the company may be required to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our trade customers to make required payments 
the company provides a general allowance for customer accounts based on historical collection and write off experience  and a specific allowance for any individually significant customers who are known to be experiencing financial difficulties 
judgment is critical because some retail customers have experienced financial difficulties 
if the financial condition of such retail customers were to worsen  additional allowances might be required 
inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
all stock keeping units skus in inventory are evaluated to determine excess or slow moving skus based on orders on hand and projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  the company estimates market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net sales value is less than cost  on an individual sku basis  an allowance is provided to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
the company also identifies slow moving and obsolete piece goods and trimming supplies that are not forecasted to be used in production and records an allowance for those items 
additionally  the company relies on cycle counts at its warehouse and distribution center to measure inventory quantities on hand  as a full physical inventory is not performed on an annual basis 
the company records a reserve to reflect estimated count differences based on the results of cycle counts performed 
asset impairment goodwill in assessing the recoverability of the company s fixed assets  goodwill and other non current assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
litigation and tax assessments from time to time  the company is subject to lawsuits and other claims  primarily related to employees 
the company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as the potential range of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in any matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not presently believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  the company is periodically engaged in various tax audits by federal and state governmental authorities incidental to its business activities 
the company records reserves for its estimated probable losses for certain of these proceedings 
it is possible that additional losses associated with these audits will be incurred  and the amounts could be material 
healthcare and workers compensation liabilities the company records estimates for certain healthcare and workers compensation costs that are self insured programs 
these reserves and the related benefit expenses are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including historical claim experiences 
each period  the company estimates the relevant factors  based primarily on historical data and uses this information to determine the assumptions underlying its reserve calculations 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
should a greater amount of claims occur than what was estimated or costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized upon shipment of products to customers 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts and retailer promotions and incentives are recognized when sales are recorded and are based on historical trends 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
reorganization charges the company has provided for reorganization charges in fiscal and to reduce the manufacturing and administrative cost structure and to exit underperforming businesses 
these charges were based on judgments about the future net realizable value of assets of closed facilities  net realizable value of other assets to be disposed of and exit costs to be incurred for severance and other liabilities 
if actual amounts differ from the estimates  adjustments will be required in future consolidated statements of income

the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  a gain or loss on settlement is recognized

management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial statements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount
