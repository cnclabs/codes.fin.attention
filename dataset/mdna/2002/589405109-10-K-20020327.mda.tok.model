overview we were incorporated in and began shipping testing products in since  we have introduced a variety of solutions for enterprise testing  production tuning and application performance management which are focused on helping our customers deploy better quality applications and to ensure their performance and availability post deployment 
we also provide both professional services to help customers implement our solutions as well as managed services for customers who do not want or have the internal resources to implement our solutions 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding securities of freshwater software  inc  a provider of ebusiness monitoring and management solutions 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of freshwater have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
if the purchase had occurred at the beginning of each period  our consolidated net revenues would have been million in  million in and million in  net income loss would have been million in  million in and million in  and earnings loss per share would have been in  in and in results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated

we may experience little to no growth in overall license revenue in the near term 
we expect sales of our apm products to grow and expect sales of our testing products to grow at a slower rate 
our testing products are generally sold under perpetual licenses with the majority of the revenue recognizable in the period of the initial sale 
our apm products and managed services are generally sold under subscription arrangements with lower up front revenue  and recurring and renewable future revenue 
license revenue increased to million in from million in in  our growth in license revenue was attributable primarily to growth in license fees from our testing products of million  as well as revenue from our new apm products of million 
service revenue  which is comprised of maintenance  training and consulting  increased to million in from million in the increase in service revenue in compared to was primarily the result of renewals of existing maintenance contracts 
we expect that service revenue will continue to increase in absolute dollars as long as our customer base continues to grow 
service revenue increased to million in from million in in  the increase in service revenue was a result of new maintenance contracts accompanying the growth in license revenue as well as renewals of existing maintenance contracts 
international sales represented of our total revenues in  in  and in the increase in international revenue in compared to as a percentage of total revenue was due to a strong sales performance in europe  offset by under performance in our asia pacific region 
the decease in international revenue from to was due to weakness in european currencies and under performance and the weak economy in asia pacific

license cost of revenue increased to million in from million in license cost of revenue as a percentage of license revenue increased to in from in the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of license revenue was primarily due to increased costs associated with our managed services business including  personnel related costs of million reflecting growth in managed services employees from to  increased fees to providers of internet bandwidth and related infrastructure of million  and  in depreciation expense of managed services equipment 
we expect license cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars but decease as a percentage of license revenues as our base of apm customers grows and the amount of related subscription and renewal revenue increases 
license cost of revenue increased to million in from million in license cost of revenue as a percentage of license revenue increased to in from in the increase as a percentage of license revenue was primarily due to our initial investment in managed services during  including million in personnel related costs  million in internet bandwidth and related intrastructure fees  and  in depreciation expense of managed services equipment

we expect service cost of revenue as a percentage of service revenue to vary based on the degree of outsourcing of training and consulting and the profitability of individual consulting engagements 
service cost of revenue increased to million in from million in as a percentage of service revenue  it decreased to in from in the absolute dollar increase in service cost of revenue in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million reflecting growth in customer support and consulting employees from at december  to at december  and a million increase in training and consulting outsourcing expense

we expect marketing and selling expenses to increase in absolute dollars but generally decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future 
marketing and selling expenses were million  or of total revenue  in  compared to million in the increase in expenses in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million reflecting growth in employees from at december  to at december   including the increase in sales employees related to our cybersales organization and apm business 
the increase in expenses in as compared to was also due to an increase in sales commissions of million attributable to higher revenue  an increase in facilities and related costs of million and an increase in spending on marketing programs of million 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee salaries and related costs associated with administration and management personnel 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in from million  or of total revenue in and million  or of total revenue in the absolute dollar increase in general and administrative spending was due to increased personnel related expenses of million reflecting an increase in average number of employees from in to in  increased professional service fees of million  and increased it and infrastructure costs of million 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or of total revenue in  from million  or of total revenue in the increase in the absolute dollars was primarily due to increased payroll related expense of million reflecting increased employees of in compared to in  and increased professional service fees of  restructuring  integration and other related charges restructuring  integration and other related charges were million in compared to zero in during the third quarter of  in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million  consisting of million for employee reductions  million for the cancellation of a marketing event  and  for professional services and consolidation of facilities 
employee reductions consisted of a reduction in force of approximately employees  or of our worldwide workforce 
total cash outlays associated with the restructuring are expected to be million 
the remaining million of costs consists of non cash charges for asset write offs 
during the year ended december   cash paid was million 
the majority of the remaining cash outlays of  which include severance costs and fees associated with the cancellation of a marketing event  occurred during the first quarter of during the second quarter of  in conjunction with the acquisition of freshwater software  inc freshwater  we also recorded a charge for certain nonrecurring restructuring and integration costs of  the charge included costs for consolidation of facilities  employee severance  and fixed asset write offs 
we expect the remaining costs of  associated with the charge to be paid during the first half of restructuring  integration and other related charges were zero in compared to million in in connection with the acquisition of conduct ltd 
in  we incurred merger related expenses primarily relating to legal and accounting expenses  severance and the write off of redundant facilities and equipment 
these restructuring costs were paid in amortization of unearned stock based compensation amortization of unearned stock based compensation in was million compared to zero in and during the second quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of freshwater  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling million associated with approximately  unvested stock options assumed 
the options assumed were valued using the fair market value of our stock on the date of acquisition  which was 
we reduced unearned stock based compensation by million due to the termination of certain employees in conjunction with the third quarter restructuring 
we also recorded additional unearned stock based compensation of  in conjunction with the third quarter restructuring 
the options were valued using the fair market value of our stock on the date of accelerated vesting  which was a weighted average of 
amortization of unearned stock based compensation for the year ended december  was million 
we expect to amortize approximately  per quarter through the second half of which is over the remaining vesting periods of the related options 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in compared to zero in and in may  we acquired all of the outstanding securities of freshwater for cash consideration of million 
the purchase price included  for the fair value of approximately  assumed freshwater vested stock options  as well as direct acquisition costs of  the fair value of options assumed were estimated using the black scholes model with the following assumptions fair value of  expected life years of four  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and dividend yield of zero percent 
the allocation of the purchase price resulted in an excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired of million 
this was allocated  based on a third party valuation  million to workforce  million to purchased technology and million to goodwill  including million of goodwill for deferred tax assets associated with the workforce and purchased technology 
during  the goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million of workforce and have reclassified the workforce to goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform a preliminary assessment of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter and potentially more frequently if circumstances change 
we completed our preliminary assessment during the first quarter of and did not record an impairment charge 
we also ceased to amortize the deferred tax asset associated with the workforce of approximately  we had recorded approximately  of amortization during and would have recorded approximately  during in lieu of amortization  we were required to offset the deferred tax asset against the deferred tax liability 
we expect to amortize approximately million of the purchased technology during the year ending december  other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense related to our convertible subordinated notes  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
other income  net was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in other income  net in as compared to was primarily due to increased interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs of million  partially offset by increased interest income of million due to a higher average annual investment balance 
the increase in other income in as compared to primarily reflected increased interest income of million due to the proceeds of the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in july  partially offset by interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the notes of million 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  on january  the standard requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through the statement of operations 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the accounting for gains or losses from changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  as well as on the type of hedging relationship 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to million of our convertible subordinated notes 
the january interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge of the fair value of our million of convertible subordinated notes the notes 
the objective of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate on the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month london interbank offered rate the libor rate plus basis points 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to entirely offset the loss or gain from changes in the fair value of the notes throughout the life of the notes 
the swap creates a market exposure to changes in the libor rate 
if the libor rate increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  quarterly on a pretax basis 
if the libor rate does not change from the rate of at the inception of the swap  we would be able to reduce interest expense from the current amount each quarter by approximately million 
under the terms of the swap  we were required to provide initial collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents to goldman sachs capital markets  lp gscm in the amount of million as continuing security for our obligations under the swap irrespective of movements in the value of the swap and from time to time additional collateral can change hands between mercury and gscm as swap rates and equity prices fluctuate 
we will account for the initial collateral and any additional collateral as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
as of march   we were required to provide additional collateral of million therefore our total restricted cash as of such date was million 
in february  we entered into a second interest rate swap with gscm that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and therefore is marked to market through other income each quarter 
the life of this swap is through july   the same date as the first swap and the original maturity date of the notes 
the swap entitles us to receive approximately  from gscm semi annually during the life of the swap  subject to the following conditions 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes  we will be required to pay the fixed rate of and receive a variable rate on the million principal amount of the notes 
we would no longer receive the  payment semi annually 

if we call the notes at a premium in whole or in part  or if any of the holders of the notes elect to convert the notes in whole or in part  we will be required to pay a variable rate and receive the fixed rate of on the principal amount of such called or converted notes 
however  we would continue to receive the  from gscm semi annually provided that the price of our common stock during the life of the swap never exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes 
we are exposed to credit exposure with respect to gscm as counterparty under both swaps 
however  we believe that the risk of such credit exposure is limited because gscm is an affiliate of a major us investment bank and because its obligations under both swaps are guaranteed by the goldman sachs group lp provision for income taxes we have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investments 
the tax holidays and rate reductions  which we will be able to realize under programs currently in effect  expire at various dates through future provisions for taxes will depend upon the mix of worldwide income and the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  differs from statutory tax rates principally because of the non deductibility of charges for amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and stock based compensation  and our participation in special reduced taxation programs in israel 
extraordinary item gain on early retirement of debt  net of taxes in december  our board of directors authorized a retirement program for our convertible subordinated notes 
under the retirement program  we may reacquire up to million in face value of the notes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid million including accrued interest  to retire million face value of the notes  which resulted in an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of million plus other related gains of  primarily related to the gain on sale of held to maturity investments  net of related taxes of million 
as of december   the notes had a remaining book value of million 
through february   we repurchased an additional million in face value for million including accrued interest 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and investments compared to million at december  and million at december  the december  balance included million of short term and million of long term investments in high quality financial  government  and corporate securities 
the decrease in cash and investments from compared to was primarily due to net cash paid in conjunction with the freshwater software  inc acquisition of million and the retirement of convertible subordinated notes of million excluding accrued interest 
during  we generated million of cash from operating activities  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash from operations from compared to was due primarily to a decrease in net income 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to an increase in net income and increases in deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
during the year ended  our investing activities consisted of net cash paid in conjunction with the freshwater acquisition of million  investments made in non consolidated companies of million and purchases of property and equipment of million offset by net proceeds from investments of million 
we have committed to make additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
our purchases of property and equipment included million for the renovation of headquarters buildings in sunnyvale  as well as  million for the construction of research and development facilities in israel 
we expect to spend an additional million on the renovations of our buildings in sunnyvale and expect to spend an additional million to complete the construction of the israel facility 
during the year ended  our primary financing activity consisted of uses of cash for the retirement of convertible subordinated notes of million excluding interest expense and purchase of treasury stock of million  offset by cash proceeds from common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans  net of notes receivable collected from issuance of common stock  of million 
in july  we raised million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes mature on july  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our future senior debt 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
we may redeem our notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after july  in december  the board of directors authorized a retirement program for our convertible subordinated notes 
under the retirement program  we may reacquire up to million in face value of the notes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid million  including accrued interest  to retire million face value of the notes  which resulting in an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of million plus other related gains of  primarily related to the gain on sale of held to maturity investments  net of related taxes of million 
as of december   the notes had a remaining book value of million 
through february   we repurchased an additional million in face value of the convertible subordinated notes for million including accrued interest 
during  a significant portion of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly  as a result of decreases in customer demand or decreases in the acceptance of our future products and services  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands convertible non subordinated cancelable notes due operating a leases total thereafter   a assuming we do not retire additional convertible subordinated notes during  we will make interest payments net of interest rate swap of approximately million during     and we will make interest payments net of interest rate swap of approximately million during assuming there is no significant change in our business  we believe that our current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
revenue recognition  
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales reserves  
accounting for software development costs  
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  
accounting for income taxes  
accounting for non consolidated companies  and 
accounting for unearned stock based compensation below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which consists of software license fees and hosted software arrangements and ii services and support revenue which includes software license maintenance  training  and consulting 
we license our software products on a term basis or on a perpetual basis 
our hosted software arrangements require customers to pay a fixed fee and receive service over a period of time  generally one or two years 
customers do not pay any set up fee 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we use either a customer order document or signed license or service agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  are based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
most of our arrangements involve multiple obligations 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales reserves the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns and write off of bad debt accounts related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  historical bad debts  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales reserves 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the provision for sales reserves amounted to million at december  accounting for software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the working model stage 
to date  products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time and all research and development costs have been expensed 
consequently  no research and development costs were capitalized in valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and goodwill and intangible assets  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its costs as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to expense long lived assets  which results in an equal amount of expense in each period 
we are required to assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill and on an annual basis  and potentially more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and 
our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december   because we believe it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the deferred tax asset as of december  was million 
accounting for non consolidated companies we make venture capital investments in early stage private companies and private equity funds for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
we monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of a company is carried at an amount in excess of fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related writedown is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
as of december   we had invested million in private companies 
in addition  we have committed to make capital contributions to a venture capital fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
if the companies in which we have made investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies or for cash  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
the recent general decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any additional declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments 
accounting for unearned stock based compensation we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line approach over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which is generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for employee stock options and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the option plans and the employee stock purchase plan espp at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the weighted average fair valuation per share of options granted under the option plans during the year ended december  was 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share for the fiscal years ended  and are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share in the future years for the following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans are not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives 
eitf issue no 
addresses the recognition  measurement  and income statement classification for sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to customers without charge  which the customer can use in  or exercise as a result of  a single exchange transaction 
sales incentives that fall within the scope of eitf issue no 
include offers that a customer can use to receive a reduction in the price of a product or service at the point of sale 
the eitf changed the transition date for issue  concluding that a company should apply this consensus no later than the company s annual or interim financial statements for the periods beginning after december  in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  effective for periods beginning after december  eitf issue no 
addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations 
upon application of these eitfs  financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes should be reclassified to comply with the income statement display requirements under these issues 
in september of  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf issues no 
 no 
and no 
 accounting for points and certain other time or volume based sales incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future 
we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million of workforce and have reclassified the workforce to goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform a preliminary assessment of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter and potentially more frequently if circumstances change 
we completed our preliminary assessment during the first quarter of and did not record an impairment charge 
we also ceased to amortize the deferred tax asset associated with the workforce of approximately  we had recorded approximately  of amortization during and would have recorded approximately  during in lieu of amortization  we were required to offset the deferred tax asset against the deferred tax liability 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to remove the deferred tax asset and the corresponding amount from the deferred tax liability 
we expect to amortize approximately million of the purchased technology during the year ended december  the impairment review involves a two step process as follows 
step we will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  the company will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

step we will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
the company will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and develops a single accounting method under which long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to rapid market and technological changes by introducing new products and services and continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our existing products and services and responding to competitive offerings 
our business will suffer if we do not successfully respond to rapid technological changes 
the market for our software products and services is characterized by 
rapidly changing technology  
frequent introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services by our competitors  
increasing complexity and interdependence of our applications  
changes in industry standards and practices  and 
changes in customer requirements and demands 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance our existing software testing and application performance management products and services and to develop new products and services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers 
the development of new products and services  and enhancement of existing products and services  entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
if we fail to anticipate new technology developments  customer requirements or industry standards  or if we are unable to develop new products and services that adequately address these new developments  requirements and standards in a timely manner  our products may become obsolete  our ability to compete may be impaired and our revenues could decline 
we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate  and it is difficult to predict our future revenues and operating results 
our revenues and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including 
fluctuations in demand for and sales of our products and services  
our success in developing and introducing new products and services and the timing of new product and service introductions  
our ability to introduce enhancements to our existing products and services in a timely manner  
changes in economic conditions affecting our customers or our industry  
changes in the mix of products or services sold in a quarter  
the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors and changes in the pricing policies of these competitors  
the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles and changes in their budgets for software and related purchases  
the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business  
deferrals by our customers of orders in anticipation of new products or services or product enhancements  and 
the mix of our domestic and international sales  together with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of our license revenues is difficult to predict because our sales cycles are typically short and can vary substantially from product to product and customer to customer 
we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
we have experienced seasonality in our revenues and earnings  with the fourth quarter of the year typically having the highest revenue and earnings for the year and higher revenue and earnings than the first quarter of the following year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from the budgeting cycles of our customers and from the structure of our sales commission program 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
in addition  our customers decisions to purchase our products and services are discretionary and subject to their internal budgets and purchasing processes 
we believe that the slowdown in the economy  the terrorist activity on september   and the ensuing declaration of the war on terrorism has caused and may continue to cause customers to reassess their immediate technology needs and to defer purchasing decisions  and accordingly has reduced and could reduce demand in the future for our products and services 
due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
if our operating results are below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the trading prices of our securities could decline 
we expect to face increasing competition in the future  which could cause reduced sales levels and result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share 
the market for our testing  tuning and application performance management products and services is extremely competitive  dynamic and subject to frequent technological changes 
there are few substantial barriers of entry in our market 
in addition  the use of the internet for a growing range of applications is a recent and emerging phenomenon 
the internet lowers the barriers of entry  allowing other companies to compete with us in the testing and application performance management markets 
as a result of the increased competition  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to identify and respond to the needs of potential customers  and to new technological and market opportunities  before our competitors identify and respond to these needs and opportunities 
we may fail to respond quickly enough to these needs and opportunities 
in the market for enterprise testing solutions  our principal competitors include compuware  empirix  radview  rational software  and segue software 
in the new and rapidly changing market for application performance management solutions  our principal competitors include providers of managed services such as gomez and keynote systems  established providers of systems and network management software such as bmc software  computer associates  hp openview and tivoli  a division of ibm  and emerging companies 
additionally  we face potential competition in this market from existing providers of testing solutions such as segue software and compuware 
the software industry is increasingly experiencing consolidation and this could increase the resources available to our competitors and the scope of their product offerings 
our competitors and potential competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies or make more attractive offers to distribution partners and to employees 
if we fail to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future  our revenues could decline 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our products through distribution channels such as systems integrators or value added resellers 
we expect that sales of our products through these channels will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we may not experience increased revenues from these new channels  which could harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our systems integrators or value added resellers  or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products and services could result in reductions in our revenue in future periods 
in addition  our ability to increase our revenue in the future depends on our ability to expand our indirect distribution channels 
our dependence on indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including 
each of our systems integrators or value added resellers  can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  
our existing systems integrators or value added resellers  may not be able to effectively sell any new products and services that we may introduce  
we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional systems integrators or value added resellers  if we lose any of our existing ones  
our systems integrators or value added resellers  may also offer competitive products and services from third parties  
we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities  and 
our systems integrators or value added resellers  may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products 
we depend on strategic relationships and business alliances for continued growth of our business 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies rely increasingly on our ability to form strategic relationships with software and other technology companies 
these business relationships often consist of cooperative marketing programs  joint customer seminars  lead referrals and cooperation in product development 
many of these relationships are not contractual and depend on the continued voluntary cooperation of each party with us 
divergence in strategy or change in focus by  or competitive product offerings by  any of these companies may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
further  if these companies enter into strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired  they could reduce their support of our products 
our existing relationships may be jeopardized if we enter into alliances with competitors of our strategic partners 
in addition  one or more of these companies may use the information they gain from their relationship with us to develop or market competing products 
if we are unable to manage rapid changes in our business  our business may be harmed 
from through  we experienced significant annual increases in revenue  employees and number of product and service offerings 
this growth has placed and  if it is renewed  will place a significant strain on our management and our financial  operational  marketing and sales systems 
during  we reduced of our workforce 
if we cannot manage rapid changes in our business environment effectively  our business  competitive position  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
although we are implementing a variety of new or expanded business and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our sales and customer support systems  the implementation of these systems  procedures and controls may not be completed successfully  or may disrupt our operations 
any failure by us to properly manage these transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and experience delays in the execution of our business plan 
conversely  if we fail to reduce staffing levels when necessary  our costs would be excessive and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
the success of our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could hurt our business 
the loss of senior personnel can result in significant disruption to our ongoing operations  and new senior personnel must spend a significant amount of time learning our business and our systems in addition to performing their regular duties 
if we cannot hire qualified personnel  our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase our revenues will suffer 
we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel at all levels in our organization is essential to the successful management of our growth 
in particular  our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in expanding our direct sales force and in maintaining a high level of technical consulting  training and customer support 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel in the software and technology industry 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or attract and retain additional qualified individuals  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to our customers 
we depend on our international operations for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales to customers located outside the us have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue and we anticipate that such sales will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenue 
as a percentage of our total revenues  sales to customers outside the us was in  in and in in addition  we have substantial research and development operations in israel 
we face risks associated with our international operations  including 
changes in taxes and regulatory requirements  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
the need to localize products for sale in international markets  
longer payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries  
seasonal reductions in business activity in other parts of the world in which we operate  
political and economic instability  and 
economic downturns in international markets 
any of these risks could harm our international operations and cause lower international sales 
for example  some european countries already have laws and regulations related to technologies used on the internet that are more strict than those currently in force in the us 
any or all of these factors could cause our business to be harmed 
because our research and development operations are primarily located in israel  we may be affected by volatile political  economic  and military conditions in that country and by restrictions imposed by that country on the transfer of technology 
our operations depend on the availability of highly skilled scientific and technical personnel in israel 
our business also depends on trading relationships between israel and other countries 
in addition to the risks associated with international sales and operations generally  our operations could be adversely affected if major hostilities involving israel should occur or if trade between israel and its current trading partners were interrupted or curtailed 
these risks are compounded due to the restrictions on our ability to manufacture or transfer outside of israel any technology developed under research and development grants from the government of israel  without the prior written consent of the government of israel 
if we are unable to obtain the consent of the government of israel  we may not be able to take advantage of strategic manufacturing and other opportunities outside of israel 
we have  in the past  obtained royalty bearing grants from various israeli government agencies 
in addition  we participate in special israeli government programs that provide significant tax advantages 
the loss of  or any material decrease in  these tax benefits could negatively affect our financial results 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
we have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment 
our taxes could increase if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration or tax rates applicable to us are increased 
tax authorities could challenge the manner in which profits are allocated among us and our subsidiaries  and we may not prevail in any such challenge 
if the profits recognized by our subsidiaries in jurisdictions where taxes are lower became subject to income taxes in other jurisdictions  our worldwide effective tax rate would increase 
our financial results may be negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
our foreign operations are generally transacted through our international sales subsidiaries 
as a result  these sales and related expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  our results of operations may be harmed by fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies  including 
a decrease in the value of pacific rim or european currencies relative to the us dollar  which would decrease our reported us dollar revenue  as we generate revenues in these local currencies and report the related revenues in us dollars  and 
an increase in the value of pacific rim  european or israeli currencies relative to the us dollar  which would increase our sales and marketing costs in these countries and would increase research and development costs in israel 
we attempt to limit foreign exchange exposure through operational strategies and by using forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany trade balances 
this requires us to estimate the volume of transactions in various currencies 
we may not be successful in making these estimates 
if these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience material currency gains or losses 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy depends on the continued growth of the internet 
in order for our business to be successful  the internet must continue to grow as a medium for conducting business 
however  as the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and the complexity of web based applications  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it or the performance or reliability of the internet might be adversely affected 
security and privacy concerns may also slow the growth of the internet 
because our revenues ultimately depend upon the internet generally  our business may suffer as a result of limited or reduced growth 
acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert the attention of our management and investments may become impaired and require us to take a charge against earnings 
in may we acquired freshwater software  inc and we have minority investments in private companies and venture capital funds of million and we may acquire or make investments in other companies and technologies 
in the event of any future acquisitions or investments  we could 
issue stock that would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders  
incur debt  
assume liabilities  
incur charges for the impairment of the value of investments or acquired assets  or 
incur amortization expense related to intangible assets 
if we fail to achieve the financial and strategic benefits of past and future acquisitions or investments  our operating results will suffer 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous other risks  including 
difficulties integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with ours  
failure to achieve targeted synergies  
unanticipated costs and liabilities  
diversion of management s attention from our core business  
adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers or those of the acquired organization  
difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and 
potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors and possible lawsuits 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the week period ended february   the closing prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include 
actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  
announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  
announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  
changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  
changes in general economic conditions  
terrorist attacks  bio terrorism and the war on terrorism  
conditions or trends affecting the software industry and the internet  and 
changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of software or internet software companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced revenues and incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 
to the extent that we increase our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will increase 
in many cases  we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants and with the customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversions of our management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
third parties could assert that our products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to litigation that  with or without merit  could be costly to defend 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against these claims 
parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell our products in the us and abroad and could result in an award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or to alter our products or processes or cease activities that infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
if we are required to obtain licenses  we cannot be sure that we will be able to do so at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain required licenses could delay shipment of our products and increase our costs 
in addition  any such lawsuit could result in our incurring significant costs or the diversion of the attention of our management 
defects in our products may subject us to product liability claims and make it more difficult for us to achieve market acceptance for these products  which could harm our operating results 
our products may contain errors or bugs that may be detected at any point in the life of the product 
any future product defects discovered after shipment of our products could result in loss of revenues and a delay in the market acceptance of these products that could adversely impact our future operating results 
in selling our products  we frequently rely on shrink wrap or click wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
under the laws of various jurisdictions  the provisions in these licenses limiting our exposure to potential product liability claims may be unenforceable 
we currently carry errors and omissions insurance against such claims  however  we cannot assure you that this insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that this insurance will provide us with adequate protection against product liability and other claims 
in the event of a product liability claim  we may be found liable and required to pay damages which would seriously harm our business 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  including an acquisition that would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
furthermore  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in july  we completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes with a principal amount of million 
we repurchased million of principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes from december  through february  we continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness  primarily the convertible subordinated notes 
there is the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including 
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  and 
limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to million of our convertible subordinated notes 
the january interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge of the fair value of our million of convertible subordinated notes the notes 
the objective of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate on the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month london interbank offered rate the libor rate plus basis points 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to entirely offset the loss or gain from changes in the fair value of the notes throughout the life of the notes 
the swap creates a market exposure to changes in the libor rate 
if the libor rate increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  quarterly on a pretax basis 
if the libor rate does not change from the rate of at the inception of the swap  we would be able to reduce interest expense from the current amount each quarter by approximately million 
under the terms of the swap  we were required to provide initial collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents to goldman sachs capital markets  lp gscm in the amount of million as continuing security for our obligations under the swap irrespective of movements in the value of the swap and from time to time additional collateral can change hands between mercury and gscm as swap rates and equity prices fluctuate 
we will account for the initial collateral and any additional collateral as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
as of march   we were required to provide additional collateral of million therefore our total restricted cash as of such date was million 
in february  we entered into a second interest rate swap with gscm that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and therefore is marked to market through other income each quarter 
the life of this swap is through july   the same date as the first swap and the original maturity date of the notes 
the swap entitles us to receive approximately  from gscm semi annually during the life of the swap  subject to the following conditions 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes  we will be required to pay the fixed rate of and receive a variable rate on the million principal amount of the notes 
we would no longer receive the  payment semi annually 

if we call the notes at a premium in whole or in part  or if any of the holders of the notes elect to convert the notes in whole or in part  we will be required to pay a variable rate and receive the fixed rate of on the principal amount of such called or converted notes 
however  we would continue to receive the  from gscm semi annually provided that the price of our common stock during the life of the swap never exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes 
we are exposed to credit exposure with respect to gscm as counterparty under both swaps 
however  we believe that the risk of such credit exposure is limited because gscm is an affiliate of a major us investment bank and because its obligations under both swaps are guaranteed by the goldman sachs group lp item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk includes risk for changes in interest to our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or issue 
in addition  we have classified all of our investments as held to maturity 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands december  thereafter total fair value cash equivalents fixed rate    weighted average rate investments fixed rate      weighted average rate total investments      weighted average rate our long term investments include million of government agency instruments  which have callable provisions and accordingly may be redeemed by the agencies should interest rates fall below the coupon rate of the investments 
the fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures fluctuates based upon changes in the price of our common stock  changes in interest rates and changes in our creditworthiness 
the fair market value of the convertible subordinated debentures as of december  was million while the book value was million 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to million of our convertible subordinated notes 
the january interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge of the fair value of our million of convertible subordinated notes the notes 
the objective of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate on the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month london interbank offered rate the libor rate plus basis points 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to entirely offset the loss or gain from changes in the fair value of the notes throughout the life of the notes 
the swap creates a market exposure to changes in the libor rate 
if the libor rate increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  quarterly on a pretax basis 
if the libor rate does not change from the rate of at the inception of the swap  we would be able to reduce interest expense from the current amount each quarter by approximately million 
under the terms of the swap  we were required to provide initial collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents to goldman sachs capital markets  lp gscm in the amount of million as continuing security for our obligations under the swap irrespective of movements in the value of the swap and from time to time additional collateral can change hands between mercury and gscm as swap rates and equity prices fluctuate 
we will account for the initial collateral and any additional collateral as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
as of march   we were required to provide additional collateral of million therefore our total restricted cash as of such date was million 
in february  we entered into a second interest rate swap with gscm that does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and therefore is marked to market through other income each quarter 
the life of this swap is through july   the same date as the first swap and the original maturity date of the notes 
the swap entitles us to receive approximately  from gscm semi annually during the life of the swap  subject to the following conditions 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes  we will be required to pay the fixed rate of and receive a variable rate on the million principal amount of the notes 
we would no longer receive the  payment semi annually 

if we call the notes at a premium in whole or in part  or if any of the holders of the notes elect to convert the notes in whole or in part  we will be required to pay a variable rate and receive the fixed rate of on the principal amount of such called or converted notes 
however  we would continue to receive the  from gscm semi annually provided that the price of our common stock during the life of the swap never exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes 
we are exposed to credit exposure with respect to gscm as counterparty under both swaps 
however  we believe that the risk of such credit exposure is limited because gscm is an affiliate of a major us investment bank and because its obligations under both swaps are guaranteed by the goldman sachs group lp we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated receivables due from certain european and asia pacific subsidiaries and foreign branches against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a forward contract as a hedge considers its effectiveness in reducing risk by matching hedging instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our operating results or cash flows 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
our operating expenses in each of these countries are in the local currencies  which mitigates a significant portion of the exposure related to local currency revenues 
from time to time  we make investments in private companies and venture capital funds 
as of december   we had invested million in private companies 
in addition  we have committed to make capital contributions to a venture capital fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
if the companies in which we have made investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies or for cash  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
the recent general decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any additional declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments
