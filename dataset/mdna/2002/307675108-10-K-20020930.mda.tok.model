item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
the results of operations for the years ended june   and are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 
the following discussion should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report and with the risk factors described below 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  including lifo reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  liabilities related to retirement benefits  liabilities resulting from self insurance of our worker s compensation liabilities  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from these estimates  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
investments our investments consist of investment grade marketable debt instruments issued by the us government and major us and foreign corporations  equity securities  primarily preferred stock  and various derivative instruments  primarily exchange traded treasury futures and options  green coffee forward contracts and commodity purchase agreements 
all derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
the fair value of derivative instruments is based upon broker quotes where possible 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their obligations 
our ability to maintain a relatively small reserve is directly related to our ability to collect from our customers when our sales people regularly interact with our customers in person 
this method of operation has historically provided us with a historically low bad debt experience 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and the costs of coffee and allied products are determined on the last in  first out lifo basis 
costs of coffee brewing equipment manufactured are accounted for on the first in  first out fifo basis 
we regularly evaluate these inventories to determine that market conditions are correctly reflected in the recorded carrying value 
self insurance retention we are self insured for california workers compensation insurance and utilize historical analysis to determine and record the estimates of expected future expenses resulting from worker s compensation claims 
additionally  we accrue for estimated losses not covered by insurance for liability  auto  medical and fire up to the deductible amounts 
retirement plans we have two defined benefit plans that provide retirement benefits for the majority of our employees the balance of our employees are covered by union defined benefit plans 
we obtain actuarial valuations for both plans and at present we discount the pension obligations using discount rate and we estimate an return on plan assets 
our retiree medical plan is not funded and shares the same discount rate as the defined benefit plans 
we also project an initial medical trend rate of ultimately reducing to in years 
the performance of the stock market and other investments as well as the overall health of the economy can have a material effect on pension investment returns and these assumptions 
a change in these assumptions could have an effect on operating results 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
we do not presently have a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets as we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have been able to maintain a strong working capital position  and believe that both our short and long term cash requirements for the coming year will be provided by internal sources 
we have no major commitments for capital expenditures at this time  but intend to begin a multi year upgrading of our internal management information system 
additionally we are prepared to loan additional funds to the employee stock ownership plan esop for purchase of up to  shares of farmer bros co 
common stock at a cost not to exceed  at june  the esop loan balance was in thousands except ratio data current assets a    current liabilities    working capital    capital expenditures    a upon adoption of sfas no 
on july   the company reclassified its investments held as available for sale to the trading category 
results of operations years ended june  and fiscal was challenging for us 
although green coffee costs remained relatively stable throughout the year  the events of september  are still being felt 
recession related reductions in business and personal travel and entertainment expenses combined with reduced activities outside the home resulting from public concern about terrorist activities resulted in decreased sales and profitability 
as depicted in the change in earnings per share analysis below  our net sales declined 
net sales decreased to  in as compared to  in gross profit decreased to  in fiscal  or of sales  compared to  in fiscal  or of sales 
the world supply of green coffee continues to be ample  and some producing countries have discussed a variety of approaches to improve producer profitability  including production decreases  decreased farm maintenance and farm worker layoffs 
to date  none of these approaches appear to have had a material effect on green coffee prices 
operating expenses  comprised of selling and general and administrative expenses were  in as compared to  in a  increase  or  in employee benefits expenses in fiscal  including the costs of employee benefit plans and medical coverage  was substantially offset by a decreases in payroll expenses   vehicle related expenses including maintenance  gas oil   and coffee brewing equipment costs  
other income decreased to  in as compared to  in the amount includes the accumulated unrealized loss of  resulting from the accounting change that year 
exclusive of the accounting change  other income decreased in from  in this decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates during as the federal reserve board has attempted to stimulate the economy 
our investments continue to be in short term money market instruments primarily investment grade commercial paper  corporate notes and us treasury and agency debt 
at june  we held approximately  in us treasury bills 
income before taxes decreased to  or of sales  for the year ended june   as compared to  or of sales  in the prior fiscal year 
net income  before cumulative effect of accounting change  for fiscal year was  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in years ended june  and fiscal presented us with a less volatile green coffee market than world green coffee supplies  bolstered by new supply from vietnam and brazil pressured green coffee prices 
green coffee prices at june  were down about from the beginning of the coffee crop in brazil  the world s largest coffee producer  weathered the frost season during our summer and a good crop was harvested 
as depicted in the change in earnings per share analysis below  our sales declined 
net sales decreased to  in as compared to  in the primary cause of our sales decline was reduced coffee usage by our customers who attributed this decrease to a variety of causes which  although not quantifiable  included the increasing number of competing beverages both hot cold and a decrease in consumer spending 
gross profit decreased to  in fiscal  or of sales  compared to  in  or of sales 
during fiscal  green coffee prices declined about as compared to fiscal prices  however  as described below gross profit was impacted by the change in accounting for coffee contracts 
during fiscal  green coffee costs increased nearly in the first half of the year  decreasing to beginning of the year levels by the first of june during the month of june  green coffee costs increased over as the result of a weather threat to the brazilian coffee crop 
operating expenses  composed of selling and general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in this increase in was primarily the result of an increase of  or  in the cost of providing coffee brewing equipment to our customers and an increase of  or  in payroll employee benefits expenses as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily related to the cost of our employee stock ownership plan 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement the adoption of statement nos 
and on july  resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of   net of taxes being recognized in the statement of net income 
upon adoption of sfas  securities were reclassified from the available for sale to the trading category 
this resulted in the recognition of the accumulated unrealized loss of  in other income 
all investments  consisting of marketable debt and equity securities  interest rate futures or options and money market instruments  are now held for trading purposes and are stated at fair value 
gains and losses  both realized and unrealized  are now included in other income and expense 
other income increased to  in as compared to  in as the result of an increase in trading securities and coffee contracts net of the reclassification adjustment described above

these statements are based on management s current expectations  assumptions  estimates and observations about our business and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results could materially differ from the forward looking statements contained herein 
these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words like expects  plans  believes  intends  will  assumes and other words of similar meanings 
these and other similar words can be identified by the fact that they do not relate solely to historical or current facts 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  we caution that it is impossible to predict the impact of such factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from predicted results 
we intend these forward looking statements to speak only at the time of this report and do not undertake to update or revise these projections as more information becomes available 
for these statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements provided by the private securities litigation reform act of factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements described herein include green coffee price volatility 
our results of operations can vary dramatically with the volatility of the green coffee market 
virtually all coffee is grown outside the united states 
some of the producing countries have experienced a variety of problems  including civil war in peru and indonesia  rebel insurgents in the philippines and the threat of economic collapse in brazil 
green coffee can be one of the most volatile of commodities 
it is subject to all the factors that influence the price of agricultural products including weather especially drought and frost  world supplies  the actions of our own and foreign governments including trade restrictions  farm subsidies currency devaluations  transportation issues including port and trucker strikes domestically and in the producing countries  and insect pests cigarette beetle and broca 
competition 
our customer base has undergone a dramatic shift in the past decade 
this is the result of several factors  including competition from other coffee companies and from other beverages 
other coffee companies include multi national firms with vast financial resources  a business model that is very different and superior information technologies 
large restaurant chains and other institutional buyers representing hospitals  hotels  contract food services  convalescent hospitals and other similar institutions often prefer the price leader and find insufficient value in the sales service aspect of our business 
we believe some of our competitors are willing to accept smaller profit margins from some customers because they do not have the distribution and service organization we do 
in addition  there are numerous beverages competing for the same restaurant dollar 
soft drinks  bottled water  flavored coffees teas all have grown at the expense of a standard cup of coffee 
we believe the growth of coffee shops that roast their own coffee has also contributed to the decrease in demand for the standard cup of coffee 
sales distribution network 
we believe our sales and distribution network to be one of the best in the industry 
it is also expensive to operate 
some of our competitors market through wholesale grocers 
therefore they do not have to address certain issues that we do  including gasoline and oil prices  the costs of purchasing  maintaining and insuring a fleet of delivery vehicles  the costs of purchasing or leasing and maintaining distribution warehouses throughout the country  or the costs of hiring  training and paying benefits for our route sales professionals 
we find that competitors unencumbered with this overhead sometimes choose to be very price competitive throughout our service area 
general economic and market conditions 
our primary market is restaurants and other food service establishments 
we also provide coffee and related products to offices 
we believe the success of this business market segment is dependent upon personal and business expenditures in restaurant locations 
in a slow economy businesses and individuals often scale back their discretionary spending on travel and entertainment  including eating out 
a weaker economy may also cause businesses to cut back on their travel and entertainment expenses  and even reduce or eliminate office coffee benefits 
self insurance 
we are self insured for many risks 
although we carry insurance  our deductibles require that we bear a substantial liability 
the premiums associated with our insurance have recently increased substantially 
general liability  fire  workers compensation  director officer  life  employee medical  dental vision and automobile present a large potential liability 
while we accrue for this liability based on historical experience  future losses may exceed losses we have incurred in the past 
risks from possible acquisitions and new business ventures 
the company regularly evaluates opportunities that may enhance shareholder value 
there is no assurance that any such venture  should we decide to enter into one  will accrue the projected returns 
it is possible that such ventures could result in losses or returns that would have a negative impact on operating income 
stock purchases and sales by major shareholders 
approximately of all outstanding shares are owned or controlled by company employees  officers and directors 
the combined holdings of the largest institutions are approximately of outstanding shares 
including the holdings of a former director of approximately of outstanding shares  current and former management and institutions control approximately of shares 
future sales of company stock could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of our shares 
esop 
the farmer bros 
co 
employee stock ownership plan was designed to help us attract and retain employees 
additionally  we believe employee stock ownership helps align the efforts of our employees with the interests of our shareholders 
to that end  the board of directors has approved loaning up to  to acquire shares 
as additional shares come available  we expect that a substantial additional amount will be approved to finance that acquisition of shares 
this will deplete our working capital and increase costs associated with the esop  especially future funding ie  requirement to provide the esop with liquidity for shares tendered back to the esop by departing employees 
we expect that as the esop acquires additional shares  the company will take on a growing fixed cost which may have a material effect on future earnings 
external factors strikes  natural disasters  acts of war and other difficulties 
over half of our business is conducted in california  oregon washington 
this area is prone to seismic activity and a major earthquake could have a significant negative effect on our operations 
our major manufacturing facility and distribution hub is in los angeles  and a serious interruption to highway arteries  gas mains or electrical service could restrict our ability to supply our branches with product 
most of our customers are disbursed throughout the western united states  with concentrations in major cities 
we depend on our own route sales network for reaching our customers 
any interruption of that distribution system could have material negative consequences for us 
our major product  coffee  is grown primarily in the tropics 
hurricanes  monsoons  tornados  severe winter storms  drought and floods all have an affect on our customers and our sources of supply 
strikes against our suppliers or their transportation vendors could restrict our ability to obtain our supply of green coffee and other supplies 
coffee is shipped to us by sea from every producing country  and by rail from mexico 
any major interruption in that flow  for example  trucker strikes in brazil  railroad strikes in mexico  coffee processors strikes in el salvador  or longshoremen strikes in us ports  can reduce our ability to maintain our flow of green coffee to our production facility and ultimately to our customers 
coffee is perishable  and although its shelf life is lengthy compared to other types of agricultural products  it does not allow for any significant stock piling 
acts of war or terrorism 
any action domestically or in a coffee producing country that interrupts the supply of green coffee to our plant or restricts our delivery of finished product to our warehouses and customers can have a material impact on our operating results 
civil war in columbia or peru  or terrorist actions in the philippines or elsewhere  can have a material effect on our operations if we are unable to receive or replace key coffee shipments 
if suitable substitute sources of supply can be located  they are often found at a much higher price 
erp system conversion 
our internal management information system is several years old and in need of updating 
the company has embarked on a two year program to update these systems by converting to a single enterprise wide software 
we believe this will be a challenging conversion 
while our personnel and consultants are working to make the conversion a success  it is possible that the conversion cost  potential complications resulting from the conversion itself  and system problems in our use of the new software could have a material impact on our future operating results 
staffing 
there is little depth of management in certain positions and a loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material effect on our operations and competitive position 
we have union contracts relating to our employees serving our california  oregon  washington and nevada markets 
although we believe union relations have been amicable in the past  there is no assurance that this will continue in the future 
hedging activities the most important aspect of our operation is to secure a consistent supply of coffee 
some proportion of green coffee price fluctuations can be passed through to our customers  with some delay  but maintaining a steady supply of green coffee is essential to keep inventory levels low and sufficient stock to meet customer needs 
we purchase our coffee through established coffee brokers to help minimize the risk of default on coffee deliveries 
to help ensure future supplies  we purchase much of our coffee on forward contracts for delivery as long as six months in the future 
sometimes these contracts are fixed price contracts  where the price of the purchase is set regardless of the change in price of green coffee between the contract and delivery dates 
at other times these contracts are variable price contracts that allow the delivered price of contracted coffee to reflect the market price of coffee at the delivery date 
futures contracts not designated as hedges  and terminations of contracts designated as hedges  are marked to market and changes are recognized in current earnings 
open contracts at june  are addressed in the following item a 
in the event of non performance by the counter parties  the company could be exposed to credit and supply risk 
the company monitors the financial viability of the counter parties in an attempt to minimize this risk 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market value risk arising from changes in interest rates on our securities portfolio 
our portfolio of investment grade money market instruments includes discount commercial paper  medium term notes  federal agency issues and treasury securities 
as of june  over of these funds were invested in instruments with maturities shorter than days 
this portfolio s interest rate risk is not hedged and its average maturity is approximately days 
a basis point move in the general level of interest rates would result in a change in the market value of the portfolio of approximately  our portfolio of preferred securities includes investments in derivatives that provide a natural economic hedge of interest rate risk 
we review the interest rate sensitivity of these securities and a enter into short positions in futures contracts on us treasury securities or b hold put options on such futures contracts in order to reduce the impact of certain interest rate changes on such preferred stocks 
specifically  we attempt to manage the risk arising from changes in the general level of interest rates 
we do not transact in futures contracts or put options for speculative purposes 
the following table demonstrates the impact of varying interest rate changes based on the preferred stock holdings  futures and options positions  and market yield and price relationships at june  this table is predicated on an instantaneous change in the general level of interest rates and assumes predictable relationships between the prices of preferred securities holdings  the yields on us treasury securities and related futures and options 
interest rate changes in thousands market value at june  change in market preferred futures and total value of total securities options portfolio portfolio basis points bp    bp    unchanged   bp    bp    the number and type of futures and options contracts entered into depends on  among other items  the specific maturity and issuer redemption provisions for each preferred security held  the slope of the treasury yield curve  the expected volatility of treasury yields  and the costs of using futures and or options 
commodity price changes we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from changes in the market price of green coffee 
we price our inventory on the lifo basis 
in the normal course of business we enter into commodity purchase agreements with suppliers and we purchase exchange traded green coffee contracts 
the following table demonstrates the impact of changes in the price of green coffee on inventory and green coffee contracts at june  it assumes an immediate change in the price of green coffee  and the valuations of coffee futures and relevant commodity purchase agreements at june  commodity risk disclosure in thousands market value of coffee cost coffee june  change in market value change inventory futures options total derivatives inventory unchanged   at june  the derivatives consisted mainly of commodity futures with maturities shorter than three months
