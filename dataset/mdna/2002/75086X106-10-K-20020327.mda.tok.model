item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  expects  and words of similar import and statements regarding our strategy  financial performance  and revenue sources that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in our other reports filed with the sec that attempt to advise interested parties of certain risks and factors that may affect our business 
you should read this analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that begin on page f overview we provide integrated web conferencing services that offer simple  reliable and cost effective tools for everyday business meetings and events 
these services offer a continuum of real time  interactive communications tools for businesses  including automated phone conferencing  web conferencing for web presentations with online controls and advanced collaboration tools  which allow users  among other things  to share applications  tour the web and whiteboard ideas online 
our business model is largely usage based  which generally means that our customers only pay for the services they use 
we sell these services to large and medium sized corporations in various markets  as well as to resellers of conferencing and communications services through our direct and indirect sales channels 
we have incurred losses since commencing operations and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss was million and million for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we expect to continue to incur losses at least through  particularly due to significant non cash charges for amortization of unearned stock option compensation and depreciation expense 
despite the progress we have made in managing and controlling expenses  we will need to generate higher revenue to support expected expenses and to achieve and sustain profitability 
on june   we acquired contigo software  inc we have included the results of operations of contigo subsequent to june  in our statements of operations 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and we recorded million of goodwill in the quarter ending june   which we are amortizing over a period of three years 
for the twelve months ended december   amortization expense pertaining to goodwill was million 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flow to recover the amount of the investment recorded  the investment may be considered impaired and could be subject to earlier write off 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued two pronouncements that affect business combinations going forward and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for previously recorded business combinations 
as a result of this new guidance  effective january  we will no longer be recording amortization on our acquired goodwill 
sfas requires a different method of determining impairment than we currently use 
the effect of this change on our financial statements has not yet been determined 
prior to our restructuring in january  we derived revenue from services other than our web conferencing services 
revenue attributable to our web conferencing services represented   and of our total revenue for the three months ended march   june   september  and december   respectively 
we expect to derive all of our revenue in the future from these services and any next generation services developed from them 
the following describes how we recognize revenue for the services we have offered in o web and phone conferencing revenue 
revenue for our web and phone conferencing service is based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
similarly  a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize revenue from our web and phone conferencing services as soon as a call or simulcast of a call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
o web conferencing pro revenue 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service  formerly called collaboration  is derived from a concurrent user and usage fee in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from concurrent user fees is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either monthly connections or minutes used 
event fees are generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements 
o webcasting revenue former service 
prices and specific service terms were usually negotiated in advance of service delivery 
we recognized revenue from live event streaming when the content was broadcast over the internet 
we recognized revenue from encoding recorded content when the content became available for viewing over the internet 
we recognized revenue from pre recorded content hosting ratably over the hosting period 
o talking email revenue former service 
prices and specific service terms were negotiated in advance of service delivery 
we recognized revenue  including any setup fees  ratably over the life of the contract 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of telecommunication expenses  depreciation of network and data center equipment  internet access fees and fees paid to network providers for bandwidth  equipment maintenance contract expenses  compensation and benefits for operations personnel and allocated overhead 
our telecommunication expenses are variable and directly correlate to the use of our services 
our depreciation  internet access and bandwidth expenses  equipment maintenance expenses and compensation expenses generally increase as we increase our capacity and build our infrastructure 
we will continue to make investments in our infrastructure  however  we do not expect a need for large scale capital expenditures in as a result  we expect expenses for depreciation  internet access and bandwidth expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars 
we expect our current capacity and infrastructure  coupled with the capital expenditures that we expect to make in early  will accommodate our revenue projections through we expect capital expenditures to average million to million per quarter over the course of the year 
we incur sales and marketing expenses that consist primarily of the salaries  commissions and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  consulting fees  remote sales offices expenses  advertising and promotion expenses and allocated overhead 
in the fourth quarter of  and continuing into the first quarter of  we streamlined our sales force  renegotiated certain sales and marketing commitments and consolidated certain remote sales offices and we believe  as of december   that we have experienced substantially all the benefits of these cost savings initiatives 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase at a lower rate than our projected percentage revenue growth 
we incur research and development expenses that consist primarily of salaries and benefits for research and development personnel  consulting fees and allocated overhead 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred  except for certain capitalized costs associated with internally developed software 
we expect to continue to make investments in research and development and anticipate that these expenses will remain relatively flat or increase slightly in absolute dollars  however  we expect them to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time 
we incur general and administrative expenses that consist primarily of expenses related to finance  human resources  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting and other professional fees  in addition to other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in terms of absolute dollars  however  we expect them to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time 
amortization of goodwill consists of goodwill acquired in business combinations 
in connection with the contigo acquisition and as a result of the recent change in accounting for goodwill  is the final year in which we recorded goodwill amortization 
we recorded a total of million of goodwill amortization in since our inception  we have used stock based compensation for employees and members of our board of directors to attract and retain strong business and technical personnel 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of deferred stock option compensation and we expensed million related to stock based compensation 
stock based compensation amounts are based on the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant or sale over the option exercise price or stock purchase price 
compensation expense related to stock options is amortized over the vesting period of options  which ranges from one to four years 
additionally  as a result of reductions and changes in our workforce that occurred in  we reversed million of deferred stock option compensation  related to the cancellation of unvested stock options 
we expect to incur stock based compensation expense of approximately million in  million in and million in for common stock issued or stock options awarded to our employees and members of our board of directors through december   under our stock compensation plans 
other data we evaluate operating performance based on several factors  including our primary internal financial measure of loss before amortization and other charges lbac 
consistent with our increased focus on controlling capital spending  we measure operating performance after charges for depreciation 
this analysis eliminates the effects of considerable amounts of amortization of goodwill recognized in connection with our acquisition of contigo software  inc  stock based compensation and the other charges set forth below 
the calculation of loss before amortization and other charges  which excludes preferred stock dividends and accretion  is as follows in thousands years ended december  net loss    add amortization of goodwill   add stock based compensation expense    add equity in loss of unconsolidated joint venture add loss on sale of investment  add asset impairment charges  add restructuring charges and contract termination expenses   loss before amortization and other charges    the trends depicted by the lbac calculation indicate that we have been successful in significantly reducing both our net loss as well as lbac  primarily as a result of our efforts to control operating costs while simultaneously increasing revenue 
for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   our net loss decreased by million and lbac decreased by million 
thus  lbac primarily indicates that although we have incurred significant expenses for goodwill amortization  asset impairment charges and other charges  which are partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense  we have significantly improved operating performance through a combination of lower operating expenses and higher revenue 
beginning january   we will have a significant reduction or improvement in our net loss because of the issuance of a new accounting standard that eliminates goodwill amortization 
as indicated in the lbac calculation above  we expensed million and million in goodwill amortization in and  respectively 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  in the future we will no longer expense goodwill amortization and  correspondingly  our net loss should decrease relative to prior periods in which we did expense significant amounts of goodwill amortization 
the funds depicted by lbac are not available for our discretionary use due to debt service  debt maturities and other commitments that we have made 
cash flow calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is as follows net cash used by operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and lbac should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  net loss attributable to common stockholders and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
lbac is a measure of operating performance and liquidity that is commonly reported and widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties because it eliminates significant non cash charges and other charges to earnings 
however  lbac as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased customer account penetration and the addition of new customers

cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  depreciation expense decreased million for the year ended december  over the respective period in primarily due to the write down of particular assets to their fair value in the second quarter of we are not recording any depreciation expense on assets no longer in use and held for disposal 
telecommunication costs and internet access costs increased million in over this increase resulted from additional phone charges consistent with increased use of our web and phone conferencing service 
salaries and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  over the respective period in due to an increase in salaries and payroll related expenses even though headcount remained relatively consistent year over year

the remainder of the expenses that decreased for the year ended december  from the year ended december  are office rent  recruiting  telecommunications and internet access costs  travel  and trade show related expenditures consistent with the reduction in our workforce and office closures that took place in january and our cost containment initiatives that continued throughout research and development 
research and development expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  personnel and payroll related expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  primarily as a result of a reduction in headcount associated with our restructuring  which took place in january  and an increase in capitalized salaries related to internally developed software

amortization expense related to goodwill would have been million in and million in in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of and at that time we will know whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  prior to our initial public offering  options and stock purchase rights were granted at less than the estimated initial public offering price resulting in deferred compensation charges  which are being recognized over vesting periods ranging from one to four years

in the second quarter of  we performed a strategic review of our fixed assets and adopted a plan to dispose of excess equipment 
this review consisted of identifying areas where we had excess capacity and  as a result  excess equipment

        loss from operations         other income expense  net net loss         as a result of our limited operating history and the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete  our operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
for example  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns 
accordingly  our operating results are difficult to predict 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as indications of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  costs and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as the market for web conferencing services 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million held as of december  net cash used by operations was  and million for each of the three years ending december   and  respectively 
cash used in operations increased from to due to an increase in our operating loss  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets  and was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used in operations decreased significantly from to due to a decrease in our operating loss and an increase in non cash expenditures 
the significant decrease in our operating loss was primarily due to our restructuring effort  which began late in the fourth quarter of and was announced in january our cost containment initiatives have continued throughout during which time we have been able to increase revenue and related cash collections

as of december   we had approximately million in total debt obligations outstanding  of which approximately million was current 
in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank that consisted of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
advances under the revolving line of credit are limited to million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the agreement 
the revolving line of credit is available through february  advances under the revolving line of credit may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit and the additional liquidity available to us  based on eligible accounts receivable  was million 
the loan and security agreement is subject to compliance with covenants  including minimum liquidity coverage  minimum quick ratio and maximum quarterly operating losses adjusted for interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges 
should we fail to comply with the loan and security agreement covenants and we are unable to cure the covenant violation or obtain a waiver of the covenant violation  we may be unable to borrow under the revolving line of credit and also may be forced to repay the outstanding balance on the term loan 
the loan and security agreement also prohibits us from paying any dividends without the bank s prior written consent 
however  we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and intend to retain all earnings  if any  for use in our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we continually monitor our compliance with all loan covenants and at december  we were in compliance with all loan covenants 
we also receive funds from time to time from the exercise of options or similar rights to purchase shares of our common stock 
we have no other material external sources of liquidity 
in the first quarter of our cash and cash equivalents decreased million  in the second quarter of our cash and cash equivalents decreased million  in the third quarter of our cash and cash equivalents decreased million and in the fourth quarter of our cash and cash equivalents increased million 
while our cash balance decreased million in  our overall cash consumption improved every quarter throughout looking ahead we expect both our debt service payments and cash basis capital expenditures to increase in over we also expect proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  however  it is not possible to estimate what impact this will have on we obtain a significant portion of our liquidity from operating cash flows 
our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across several industries and none of our customers constituted greater than of our revenue in and we anticipate that we may have a single customer in that will exceed of our revenue 
our operating cash flow could be adversely affected in the event a customer concentration exists and this customer experiences financial difficulties 
in the third quarter of the board of directors of evoke communications europe  our unconsolidated joint venture  unanimously approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution and  as a result  evoke communications europe will be liquidated and its operations will cease 
we expect to receive in connection with the liquidation  and prior to december   cash of approximately million 
this receivable is reflected in the balance sheet in current assets as due from affiliate 
as of december   our purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and telephony services were approximately million and will be expended over the next four years 
some of these agreements may be amended to either increase or decrease the minimum commitments during the lives of the contract 
we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through a large number of these facilities are satellite sales offices that typically average  square feet 
total future minimum lease payments  under all operating leases  as of december  are approximately million 
we are in the process of attempting to sublease or otherwise minimize our lease commitments with respect to seven offices  and to the extent we are successful in subleasing or otherwise relieving ourselves of the lease obligations  these facility lease commitments  net of any subleases  will decrease 
through december   we have been successful in terminating four facility leases  thereby relieving ourselves of any future obligation  and we have been successful in subleasing four facilities 
future minimum sublease receivables for the four subleased facilities  as of december   approximate million that we expect to receive through august our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than total year years years over years long term debt    operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual obligations and commitments 
     we expect that existing cash resources and the credit facility we obtained in october will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
we expect our cash flow will continue to improve and will eventually enable us to consistently maintain positive cash flow from operations  and that existing cash reserves will therefore be sufficient to meet our capital requirements during this period 
we base our expenses and expenditures in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than expected  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or  if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue for our web and phone conferencing service is based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize revenue from our web and phone conferencing services as soon as a call or simulcast of a call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service is derived from a concurrent user and usage fee in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from concurrent user fees is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either monthly connections or minutes used 
event fees are generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our doubtful accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience doubtful accounts at the same rate as we have in the past 
our accounts receivable is currently diverse and is comprised of numerous customers geographically dispersed across many different industries with no one customer representing greater than of our revenue or accounts receivable 
as we continue to grow and focus our efforts on attracting larger customers  including large telecommunication companies  we anticipate that we will have a customer concentration with at least one customer during a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and future operating results 
goodwill and long lived assets and their impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets including property and equipment and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets including property and equipment and goodwill may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare the result to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
there were no impairment losses in in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million  which was included as a component of our restructuring charge 
in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million for property and equipment and million for intangible assets 
net property and equipment and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will no longer amortize approximately million in net goodwill 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million in and would have been million in and million in in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first quarter of and at that time we will determine whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
accounting for unconsolidated entities we have an investment in evoke communications europe  our majority owned subsidiary  for which we do not have voting control and account for using the equity method of accounting 
we have recorded losses  which have reduced our investment in evoke communications europe to zero 
we have no obligations to fund future operating losses of evoke communications europe and while this entity does have third party debt  the debt is non recourse to us 
additionally  in the third quarter of the board of directors of evoke communications europe unanimously approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution and  as a result  evoke communications europe will be liquidated and its operations will cease 
we believe that evoke communications europe has sufficient working capital to meet all of its third party financial obligations and will distribute approximately million to us as part of the liquidation and dissolution 
should additional financial obligations of evoke communications europe arise it could reduce the distribution we currently expect to receive 
conversely  should the liabilities settle at amounts lower than were estimated or assets settle at amounts higher than were estimated  we may receive a larger distribution than evoke communications europe is currently projecting 
income tax valuation allowances we currently record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset benefit to zero 
we have not generated taxable income and until we do so we expect to continue to provide a valuation allowance for of our deferred tax benefit 
when we determine that we will be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax benefits  we will record an asset that will increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
at december   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million  which is available to offset future taxable income through restructuring reserves at december   our restructuring reserves totaled million and solely relate to lease costs  which will be relieved as payments are made 
in addition  facility reserves will increase or decrease based on our ability to sublease vacant spaces  which are under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through as of december   the facility reserve was comprised of seven offices 
currently  the minimum lease payments for the seven offices total approximately  per month 
due to the current real estate market  it has taken us longer than expected to sub lease or otherwise terminate our lease obligations in certain cities 
however  we continually monitor and adjust  as warranted  our restructuring reserve associated with remote sales facilities based on current facts and circumstances 
if we are able to sublease or otherwise terminate a lease obligation on terms more favorable than we currently have projected  we will adjust the reserve accordingly and increase income in the quarter the adjustment is made 
if we are unable to reduce or eliminate our commitment on the seven remaining offices in a timely fashion  we will make unfavorable adjustments to the restructuring reserve and record expense in the quarter the adjustments are made 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
and sfas and sfas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires that the purchase method be used for business combinations initiated after june  under sfas we will no longer amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead will be subject to periodic testing for impairment 
we adopted the provisions of sfas immediately upon issuance and will adopt the provisions of sfas on january  at january  we will have unamortized goodwill of million  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million in and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on our financial statements at the date of this report  including whether we will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas is effective in fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
we expect that the provisions of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position upon adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas effective january  in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long term assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas superseded statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events or transactions 
the provisions of sfas are effective in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted  and in general are to be applied prospectively 
we will adopt sfas effective january  and we do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should not rely on forward looking statements because they are inherently uncertain 
this document contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  expect  future  intend  plan and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are only predictions 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this document 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described on the following pages and elsewhere in this document 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements included in this document 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control 
the risk factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language in this document  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this document could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price 
we have a history of losses  we expect significant continuing losses and we may never attain profitability 
if we do not achieve or sustain profitability in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
our operating costs have exceeded our revenue in each quarter since our inception in april we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  and we anticipate net losses through at least our revenue may not continue to grow and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
in addition  we expect to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses in the future 
accordingly  we must significantly increase our revenue to achieve and maintain profitability and to continue our operations 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history and you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future performance 
we were incorporated in april and first recorded revenue in january we only began commercially offering our web and phone conferencing service in april and our web conferencing pro service in june in january  we restructured our company to focus solely on these services 
in connection with this restructuring  we made significant changes to our services and growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters  including a significant reduction in our employee base 
as a result  we have a limited relevant operating history and it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company  and we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
in addition  the rapidly changing nature of the web conferencing market makes it difficult or impossible for us to predict future results  and you should not expect our future revenue growth to equal or exceed our recent growth rates 
our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a cost effective manner  if at all 
we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which would cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history  increased competition  the rapidly changing market for our services and the other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
for example  our quarterly net loss ranged between million and million in the four quarters ended december  our quarterly revenues ranged between million and million in the four quarters ended december  many of the factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results are beyond our control  such as increased competition and market demand for our services 
as a result of these factors and other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would decline 
additionally  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns 
our operating results have shown decreases in our usage based services around the spring  thanksgiving  december and new year holidays 
we expect that our revenue during these holiday seasons and during the summer vacation period will not grow at the same rates as compared to other periods of the year because of decreased use of our services by business customers 
we depend on single source suppliers for key components of our infrastructure  the loss of which could cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
we purchase key components of our telephony hardware infrastructure from a single supplier 
any extended reduction  interruption or discontinuation in the supply of these components would cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
these components form the basis of our audio conferencing infrastructure  upon which the majority of our services rely 
in order to continue to expand our infrastructure capacity  we must purchase additional components from this supplier 
because we do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with this supplier  it may unilaterally increase its prices for these components  and as a result  we could face higher than expected operating costs and impaired operating results 
in addition  this supplier could cease supplying us with these components 
we could also experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or in integrating alternative components into our technology platform if our single source ceased supplying us with these components 
we also rely on a single supplier for the majority of our storage hardware  which store critical operations data and maintain the reliability of our services 
if we are required to find alternative sources for such equipment  we may experience difficulty in integrating them into our infrastructure 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customers  none of whom are obligated to continue to use our services 
the failure of continued use of our services by existing customers could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customer usage of our services 
our customers are not obligated to continue to use our services as we provide our services largely on a usage based model 
as a result  our inability to retain existing customers and sustain or increase their usage of our services could result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to become profitable and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  because many of our customers have no continuing obligations with us  we may face increased downward pricing pressure that could cause a decrease in our gross margins 
our customers depend on the reliability of our services and we may lose a customer if we fail to provide reliable services for even a single communication event 
additionally  we target our service to large companies  including large telecommunications companies  and as a result  we may experience an increase in customer concentration 
if any of these large customers stop using our services or are unable to pay their debts as they become due  our operating results will be harmed 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
our growth depends on our ability to develop leading edge web conferencing services and features 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we commercially released our web conferencing pro service  an upgrade to the prior version of our web conferencing pro service 
we may not successfully identify  develop and market web conferencing pro and other new services and features in a timely and cost effective manner 
if the services and features we develop fail to achieve widespread market acceptance or fail to generate significant revenues to offset development costs  our net losses will increase and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability 
in addition  our ability to introduce new services and features may depend on us acquiring technologies or forming relationships with third parties and we may be unable to identify suitable candidates or come to terms acceptable to us for any such acquisition or relationship 
we also may not be able to successfully alter the design of our systems to quickly integrate new technologies 
in addition  we have experienced development delays and cost overruns in our development efforts in the past and we may encounter these problems in the future 
delays and cost overruns could affect our ability to respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards  competitive developments or customer requirements 
competition in the web conferencing services market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully 
the market for web conferencing services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and may force us to reduce our prices  or cause us to experience reduced sales and margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of our services 
many of our current and potential competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to spread costs across diversified lines of business  and therefore  adopt aggressive strategies  such as reduced pricing structures and large scale marketing campaigns  that reduce our ability to compete effectively 
telecommunication providers  for example  enjoy lower per minute long distance costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunication network 
we expect that many more companies will enter this market and invest significant resources to develop web conferencing services 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
for example o competitors could acquire or partner with companies with which we have distribution relationships and discontinue our partnership  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our services  o a competitor could be acquired by or enter into a strategic relationship with a party that has greater resources and experience than we do  thereby increasing the ability of the competitor to compete with our services  or o a competitor could acquire or partner with one of our key suppliers 
if we fail to offer competitive pricing  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
because the web conferencing market is relatively new and still evolving  the prices for these services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
in many cases  businesses provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we may be required to significantly reduce our pricing structure  which would negatively affect our revenues  margins and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
our business will suffer if our systems fail or become unavailable 
a reduction in the performance  reliability or availability of our systems will harm our ability to provide our services to our users  as well as harm our reputation 
some of our customers have experienced interruptions in our services in the past due to service or network outages  periodic system upgrades and internal system failures 
similar interruptions may occur from time to time in the future 
because our revenue depends largely on the number of users and the amount of minutes consumed by users  our business will suffer if we experience frequent or extended system interruptions 
we maintain our primary data facility and hosting servers at our headquarters in louisville  colorado  and a secondary data facility in denver  colorado 
our operations depend on our ability to protect these facilities and our systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  water  telecommunications failure  vandalism  sabotage and similar unexpected events 
in addition  a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our systems or infrastructure could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and systems that we use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause service interruptions and  as a result  materially harm our reputation  negatively affect our revenue  and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
if our security system is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
we must securely receive and transmit confidential information over public networks and maintain that information on internal systems 
our failure to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation  and expose us to risk of loss or liability 
if we fail to provide adequate security measures to protect the confidential information of our customers  our customers may refrain from using our services or potential customers may not choose to use our services  and as a result  our operating results would be harmed 
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
in addition  our internal systems are accessible to a number of our employees 
although each of these employees is subject to a confidentiality agreement  we may be unable to prevent the misappropriation of this information 
if we do not increase the capacity of our infrastructure in excess of customer demand  customers may experience service problems and choose not to use our services 
the amount of conferencing events we host has increased significantly 
we must continually increase our capacity in excess of customer demand 
to rapidly expand our operations and to add customers requires a significant increase in the capacity of our infrastructure 
to increase capacity  we may be required to order equipment with substantial development and manufacturing lead times 
if we fail to increase our capacity in a timely and efficient manner  customers may experience service problems  such as busy signals  improperly routed conferences  and interruptions in service 
service problems such as these would harm our reputation  cause us to lose customers and decrease our revenue  and therefore our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
conversely  if we overestimate our capacity needs  we will pay for more capacity than we actually use  resulting in increased costs without a corresponding increase in revenue  which would harm our operating results 
our failure to manage growth could cause substantial increases in our operating costs and harm our ability to achieve profitability and  therefore  decrease the value of our stock 
despite our recent restructuring in january  which resulted in  among other things  a significant reduction in the size of our workforce  we have rapidly expanded since inception  and will continue to expand our operations and infrastructure 
this expansion has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources  particularly as a result of our recent downsizing  and we may not effectively manage this growth 
rapidly expanding our business would require us to invest significant amounts of capital in our operations and resources  which would substantially increase our operating costs 
as a result  our failure to manage our growth effectively could cause substantial increases in our operating costs without corresponding increases in our revenue  thereby harming our ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
also  our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time managing growth 
in order to rapidly expand our business we may need to raise additional funds 
any future financing we require may not be available on a timely basis  in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate funds  we may not be able to compete effectively 
our joint venture with viso limited was not successful and any additional international expansion may not be successful  which could harm our strategy to expand internationally and cause our operating losses to increase 
we have expanded into international markets and spent significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
in particular  we formed a joint venture european subsidiary with viso limited  a european based venture capital firm  to expand our operations to continental europe and the united kingdom 
currently  this joint venture subsidiary is in the process of being liquidated and will be dissolved 
this decision may harm our strategy to expand internationally  and we may not realize any value from the costs associated with starting up this venture 
in addition  we may be required to expend significant costs  resources and time to execute this dissolution and liquidation 
as a result  our operating results may be harmed and we may not achieve or sustain profitability  thereby causing our stock price to decline 
if we continue to expand internationally  either alone or with a partner  we would be required to spend additional financial and managerial resources that may be significant 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as o difficulties in establishing and maintaining distribution channels and partners for our services  o varying technology standards from country to country  o uncertain protection of intellectual property rights  o inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  o linguistic and cultural differences  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  o imposition of currency exchange controls  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  our expansion into international markets may require us to develop specific technology that will allow our current systems to work with international telephony systems 
we may not develop this technology in a timely manner  in a way to prevent service disruptions or at all 
we may acquire other businesses  form joint ventures and make investments in other companies that could negatively affect our operations and financial results and dilute existing stockholders 
the pursuit of additional business relationships through acquisitions  joint ventures  or other investment prospects may not be successful  and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition  joint venture  or other investment 
we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions 
there may also be risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
further  these potential acquisitions  joint ventures and investments entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate a company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
there may also be unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition that may harm our operating results and key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these risks could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  if we were to make any acquisitions  we could o issue equity securities that would dilute our stockholders  o expend cash  o incur debt  o assume unknown or contingent liabilities  or o experience negative effects on our reported results of operations 
our web and phone conferencing service may become subject to traditional telecommunications carrier regulation by federal and state authorities  which would increase the cost of providing our services and may subject us to penalties 
we believe our web and phone conferencing service is not subject to regulation by the federal communications commission or any state public service commission because the services integrate traditional voice teleconferencing and added value internet services 
the fcc and state public service commissions  however  may require us to submit to traditional telecommunications carrier regulations for our web and phone conferencing service under the communications act of  as amended  and various state laws or regulations as a provider of telecommunications services 
if the fcc or any state public service commission seeks to enforce any of these laws or regulations against us  we could be prohibited from providing the voice aspect of our web and phone conferencing service until we have obtained various federal and state licenses and filed tariffs 
we believe we would be able to obtain those licenses  although in some states  doing so could significantly delay our ability to provide services 
we also would be required to comply with other aspects of federal and state laws and regulations 
subjecting our web and phone conferencing service to these laws and regulations would increase our operating costs  could require restructuring of those services to charge separately for the voice and internet components  and would involve on going reporting and other compliance obligations 
we also might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
our competitors may be able to create systems with similar functionality to ours and third parties may obtain unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
the success of our business is substantially dependent on the proprietary systems that we have developed 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we currently rely on a combination of trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  copyrights  and confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions 
we also own two patents relating to the web touring feature of our web conferencing pro service 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our web conferencing services and other intellectual property 
unauthorized third parties may copy or infringe upon aspects of our technology  services or other intellectual property 
other than the patents that we own  our proprietary systems are not currently protected by any patents and we may not be successful in our efforts to secure patents for our proprietary systems 
regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors and others may be able to develop similar systems and services without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our proprietary systems and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property and we may not have any adequate remedies 
furthermore  the validity  enforceability and scope of protection for intellectual property such as ours in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
in addition  our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and the outcome could be uncertain 
we may be subject to claims alleging intellectual property infringement 
we may be subject to claims alleging that we have infringed upon third party intellectual property rights 
claims of this nature could require us to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves  regardless of their merit 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions  divert management attention and resources  or halt or delay distribution of our services while we re engineer them or seek licenses to necessary intellectual property  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as the number of competitors in our market grows  there is an increased risk that the proprietary systems and software upon which our services rely may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims 
if any of the third party services that we use become unavailable to us  our services would be subject to significant delays and increased costs 
we rely on third party services  such as internet access  transport and long distance providers 
these companies may not continue to provide services to us without disruptions  at the current cost  or at all 
the costs associated with a transition to a new service provider would be substantial 
we may be required to reengineer our systems and infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider  which would be both expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in the past  we have experienced disruptions and delays in our services due to service disruptions from these providers 
any interruption in the delivery of our services would likely cause a loss of revenue and a loss of customers 
we rely on the adoption of multimedia technology by corporations and our ability to transmit our services through corporate security measures 
in order to adequately access the streaming aspects of our services  our users generally must have multimedia personal computers with certain microprocessor requirements  at least kbps internet access  a standard media player and a sound card 
for our web conferencing pro services  minimum requirements include a java enabled browser and a kbps internet connection 
if there are significant changes to internet browsers that make them incompatible with our java based web conferencing pro service  we may be forced to modify the software underlying this service  which may affect our ability to deliver quality service in a timely manner  and our business would be harmed 
installing and configuring the necessary multimedia components may require technical expertise that some users do not possess 
furthermore  because of bandwidth constraints on corporate intranets and concerns about security  some information systems managers may block reception of multimedia within their corporate environments 
in order for users to receive multimedia over corporate intranets  security measures and corporate firewalls  information systems managers may need to reconfigure these intranets  security measures and firewalls 
widespread adoption of multimedia technology depends on overcoming these obstacles  improving voice and video quality and educating customers and users in the use of media technology 
our web conferencing services will not generate significant revenue if businesses do not switch from traditional teleconferencing and communication services to web conferencing 
if businesses do not switch from traditional teleconferencing and communication services  our services will not generate significant revenue 
businesses that have already invested substantial resources in traditional or other methods of communication may be reluctant to adopt new web conferencing services 
if sufficient demand for our services does not develop  we will have difficulty selling our services and generating significant increases in revenue 
as a result  we would not achieve or sustain profitability and the price of our common stock would decline 
growth in revenue from our services will depend in part on an increase in the number of customers using the web based features in addition to our traditional conferencing features 
in  only a small percentage of our customers of this service used the web in this way 
we disclose pro forma financial information 
we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash charges  consisting primarily of the amortization of goodwill  stock based compensation and restructuring costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  or annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
we are subject to risks associated with governmental regulation and legal uncertainties 
it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the united states and other countries with respect to the internet that might affect us 
these laws may relate to areas such as o changes in telecommunications regulations  o copyright and other intellectual property rights  o encryption  o personal privacy concerns  including the use of cookies and individual user information  o e commerce liability  and o email  network and information security 
changes in telecommunications regulations could substantially increase the costs of communicating on the internet 
this  in turn  could slow the growth in internet use and thereby decrease the demand for our services 
several telecommunications carriers are advocating that the federal communications commission regulate the internet in the same manner as other telecommunications services by imposing access fees on internet service providers 
recent events suggest that the fcc may begin regulating the internet in such a way 
in addition  we operate our services throughout the united states and state regulatory authorities may seek to regulate aspects of our services as telecommunication activities 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulations than those that have been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our services  and may affect the growth of the internet 
such laws or regulations may therefore harm our business 
we may be subject to assessment of sales and other taxes for the sale of our services  license of technology or provision of services  for which we have not accounted 
we may have to pay past sales or other taxes that we have not collected from our customers 
we do not currently collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services 
our business would be harmed if one or more states or any foreign country were to require us to collect sales or other taxes from current or past sales of services  particularly because we would be unable to go back to customers to collect sales taxes for past sales and may have to pay such taxes out of our own funds 
internet related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price 
the stock market in general and the stock prices of internet related companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
because we are an internet related company  we expect our stock price to be similarly volatile 
these broad market and industry factors may reduce our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had long term debt  including current portion  in the aggregate amount of million with interest rates ranging from to with payments due through october a change in interest rates would not affect our obligations related to long term debt existing as of december   as the interest payments related to that debt are fixed over the term of the debt 
at december   we had a million revolving line of credit with a loan value of million based on of the underlying eligible accounts receivable at year end 
advances under the revolving line of credit will reflect interest at the bank s prime rate and therefore any advances under this revolving line of credit would subject us to interest rate fluctuations 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings including any advances on our revolving line of credit 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks through an advance to our european joint venture which is payable in euros 
we do not employ any risk mitigation techniques with respect to this advance 
our european joint venture is in the process of dissolution and liquidation and our foreign currency risk with respect to the loan will be eliminated when these processes are completed 
although we do not have any investments at december   we may purchase investments that may decline in value as a result of changes in equity markets and interest rates
