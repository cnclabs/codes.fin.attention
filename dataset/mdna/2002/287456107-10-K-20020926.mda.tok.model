item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating segments effective september   the company changed its corporate name from elcor corporation to elkcorp to better identify itself with the elk brand name of its principal building products subsidiaries 
the company is segregated and managed as two segments elk premium building products building products and elk technologies other  technologies 
the building products group consists of the various operating subsidiaries of elk premium building products  inc collectively elk 
these companies manufacture premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles and coated and non coated nonwoven fabrics used in asphalt shingles and other applications in the building and construction  filtration  floor coverings and other industries 
building products accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal the other  technologies segment consists of the operations that are not part of the building products segment 
these dissimilar operations are combined into one segment beginning in fiscal  as none individually meet the materiality criteria for separate segment reporting 
prior to fiscal  the other  technologies segment was shown as two separate segments electronics manufacturing services and industrial products 
the businesses aggregated together as the other  technologies segment accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal the operations included as other  technologies are the operating subsidiaries of cybershield  inc collectively cybershield  which apply precise conductive metal coatings to plastic components utilized in electronics enclosures to control the electromagnetic and radio frequency emissions of such devices  and to create circuitry and antennae for digital wireless cellular phones  consumer electronics equipment  and various other industries  chromium corporation chromium  which is a leading provider of hard chrome and other surface finishes for the railroad  marine and various other industries  and ortloff engineers  ltd ortloff  a leading supplier of proprietary technologies and related engineering services to the natural gas processing industry 
a fourth operation  elk technologies  inc  was recently incorporated to develop and market fabrics featuring versashield fire retardant coatings for use outside of traditional building products applications  including mattresses  furniture  curtains and bed clothing 
this business has not yet produced commercial sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   net income of  was higher than  in fiscal sales of  were higher in the current fiscal year compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
the significant increase in both sales and income in fiscal is primarily attributable to significant improvements in operations in the building products segment 
the other  technologies segment also recorded higher sales but  primarily due to consolidation of cybershield s operations  recorded a significant operating loss in fiscal compared to an operating profit in fiscal consolidated operating income of  in fiscal was higher than  in the prior fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal was reduced by  of noncash stock option compensation  due to the change in accounting for certain stock options from fixed awards with no compensation expense to variable awards  which can result in periodic expense or income 
in fiscal  the company determined that variable accounting is more appropriate for such stock options 
the impact of variable accounting in fiscal is not material 
based on a decline in the company s share price subsequent to june  and actions taken by the board of directors to terminate the feature of the incentive stock option plan that caused certain stock options to be accounted for as variable awards  the company expects to record a reversal of the majority of fiscal noncash stock option compensation in the first quarter of fiscal operating income for the current year also included two other significant nonrecurring items a favorable cash settlement with a vendor resulting in income of  and plant closure and related costs of  as a percentage of sales  operating income was in fiscal excluding noncash stock option compensation compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal were significantly higher than in the prior fiscal year  due primarily to overall higher sales levels  increased selling expenses related to new product introductions  higher incentive compensation resulting from improved performance and retirement expenses related to management succession 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs  excluding the nonrecurring vendor settlement  were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal however  in fiscal  the company capitalized  of interest related to the construction of the myerstown  pennsylvania shingle plant and other major projects 
no interest cost was capitalized in fiscal the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in fiscal compared to in fiscal results of business segments sales in the building products segment increased to  for the year ended june  compared to  in fiscal the significant increase in sales reflected a sharp rebound in shipments of premium laminated asphalt shingles that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal  together with higher average selling prices in fiscal  which were higher than in fiscal highly successful new products and warranty initiatives and a favorable inventory position  combined with lower interest rates this year and storm damage in the midwest and southwest united states  contributed to sharply higher sales for this business segment 
building products sales further benefited from success in penetrating markets served by its new myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant  which met its performance test level of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  shipments of laminated shingles were adversely affected by weak economic conditions and harsh winter weather conditions in the northern united states and heavy winter and spring rains in many other parts of the country 
operating income for the building products segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
current year operating income included a  favorable vendor settlement 
the cash settlement represented a reimbursement of certain general and administrative costs previously incurred by elk 
excluding this nonrecurring item  operating income increased to  an increase over the previous fiscal year 
the increase in recurring operating income is primarily the result of a significant increase in shipments of premium laminated fiberglass shingles and performance nonwoven fabrics 
increased product sales more than offset higher marketing costs and depreciation relating to the new myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant 
fiscal building products sales benefited from a significant level of severe weather related roof replacement activity that may not recur in fiscal therefore  the company anticipates more moderate sales growth in fiscal however  operating profit is expected to grow at a significantly faster rate than sales as the company moves closer to selling out in place manufacturing capacity 
operating profit margins for the building products segment will also reflect the potential impact of changing raw material costs  product pricing and sales mix 
although each of these variables is expected to be under market pressure in fiscal  management believes the company can successfully manage the controllable factors 
sales for the other  technologies segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal cybershield s unit volumes declined  but average selling prices were higher  primarily as a result of an increased sales mix of units containing purchased plastic parts 
sales for chromium were also lower in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year due to lower unit volumes as railroads deferred maintenance expenditures 
ortloff sales were higher in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to a higher level of licensing and consulting fees from international gas processing projects 
the other  technologies segment reported a  operating loss in fiscal compared to  in operating income in fiscal the current year operating loss includes  of nonrecurring costs relating to consolidating cybershield s operations 
fiscal included  of costs relating to the consolidation of manufacturing operations and initial production of products new to chromium s cleveland  ohio plant 
excluding these nonrecurring costs  operating income for the other  technologies segment in fiscal would have been  compared to  of operating income in fiscal the reduction in operating results reflects lower unit volumes and related margins at cybershield  costs associated with the ramp of several new handset components and production start up inefficiencies during the early part of fiscal at cybershield  and lower unit volumes at chromium 
despite these lower volumes  chromium was able to maintain profitability in fiscal due to cost reductions 
ortloff s operating income was higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to higher licensing and consulting fees 
fiscal is expected to be a year of transition for both cybershield and chromium 
both of their respective markets are under pressure and both must diversify their revenue sources into new markets in order to realize success 
at both  management believes that organizations and strategies are in place to accomplish the task 
cybershield should see significantly lower sales as a result of an exodus of us and latin american cellular handset production to asia 
in response  cybershield has further reduced its costs beyond the savings realized from the canton  georgia plant closure 
cybershield has also formed marketing partnerships with key supply chain partners and has developed a network of manufacturers representatives to augment its internal sales force 
these strategic moves should hasten the process of diversifying cybershield s revenue sources 
commercialization of the exact metalization technology is also a key factor for generating new sales 
management anticipates diminishing quarterly losses as fiscal progresses 
chromium is beginning to see good market reaction to its new wear plate and tile products utilizing chromium s proprietary crodon hard chrome finish 
these products are designed to extend the service life of steel machinery components operating in abrasive environments and have applications in a wide variety of industries 
chromium is targeting of its sales from these products by the end of fiscal the company anticipates that chromium will be profitable in fiscal a new subsidiary  elk technologies  inc  was recently formed to develop and market fabrics featuring elk s versashield fire retardant coatings for use outside of traditional building products applications 
current areas of emphasis include mattresses  upholstered furniture  curtains and bed clothing 
while these activities have not produced commercial sales to date  management believes that potentially significant demand for products utilizing this technology could result from trends toward more stringent flammability requirements for mattresses and upholstered furniture 
the company plans to generate revenue from these products in fiscal during the past year  ortloff was successful in marketing its technology for use in new international natural gas development projects 
the outlook for is for ortloff s continued success  primarily in international projects 
fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   net income of  was lower than  in fiscal sales of  were lower in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
the company s two largest business segments  building products and electronics manufacturing services  each recorded lower sales and much lower operating income 
the industrial products segment was able to achieve increased sales in fiscal compared to fiscal and a significantly reduced operating loss 
consolidated operating income of  in fiscal was lower than  in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of sales  operating income was in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal were significantly higher than in fiscal as a result of higher selling and marketing costs in the building products segment  primarily relating to its new roofing manufacturing plant and a new marketing campaign  together with higher depreciation at the corporate office relating to its enterprise resource system 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were of sales in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company recorded a  gain from involuntary conversion as a result of payments received on a property insurance claim in excess of the net book value of destroyed assets 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in the prior fiscal year as a result of  among other things  increased working capital requirements and higher overall interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal the company capitalized  of interest in fiscal in connection with the construction of its new myerstown  pennsylvania shingle plant and other major projects 
in fiscal   in interest costs were capitalized 
results of business segments sales for the building products segment of  for the fiscal year ended june  were lower than  in the prior fiscal year 
lower sales were primarily the result of reduced shipments of nonwoven fiberglass roofing mats 
demand for elk s nonwoven fiberglass roofing mats  which are primarily sold to other roofing manufacturers  was adversely affected by weakened economic conditions that caused a decline in the total asphalt shingle market in fiscal because of weak economic conditions  the growth rate for premium laminated shingles  which represents elk s primary market  rose less than in fiscal  compared to a compounded annual growth rate for the past five years 
harsh winter weather conditions in the northern united states and heavy winter and spring rains in many parts of the country contributed to a decrease in demand for much of fiscal compared to the record setting prior year 
in addition  actions by competitors in the early part of fiscal to increase their production of laminated shingles further contributed to an excess supply of laminated shingles relative to demand  thereby creating a weakened price environment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the industry s year over year growth rate for premium laminated shingles increased about 
elk benefited from its decision to build inventories throughout the winter and spring months in anticipation of potentially better market conditions in the roofing season  which generally runs from march to november in many of elk s key market areas 
the strong rebound in demand in the final two months of fiscal allowed elk to achieve slightly higher shipments of premium laminated shingles for fiscal compared to fiscal also  improving industry balance between supply and demand near the end of fiscal allowed elk to implement a small price increase effective in july operating income for the building products segment in fiscal of  was lower than the record level of  in the prior fiscal year 
reduced sales of nonwoven fiberglass roofing mats reduced year over year operating income by approximately  average selling prices for laminated shingles were also slightly lower in fiscal compared to fiscal the company incurred approximately  in higher raw material costs  particularly asphalt and glass fiber costs 
higher energy expenses and costs relating to the development of significant new products  many of which were introduced in fiscal  further negatively impacted fiscal operating income compared to the prior fiscal year 
the new myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant reduced operating profit by approximately  in fiscal the myerstown plant was also indirectly responsible for increasing selling expenses by approximately  as the company positioned itself to support higher shingle sales relating to this new plant 
operating income in fiscal included  of income relating to the settlement of the company s business interruption claim resulting from the fiscal nonwoven plant explosion 
sales for the electronics manufacturing services segment of  for the fiscal year ended june  were lower than  in fiscal operating income for the electronics manufacturing services group of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the severe downturn in the telecommunications industry during fiscal sharply reduced demand for digital cell phone models and telecom infrastructure equipment 
comparative year to year sales and operating results were also negatively affected by actions by a significant customer in the latter part of fiscal to establish a second source for some of its cellular handset shielding requirements 
decreased operating income is primarily attributable to reduced sales  higher costs incurred for initial production ramp ups on new digital wireless handset products  and costs associated with workforce reductions as orders for many products were severely curtailed or cancelled 
sales for the industrial products segment increased in fiscal to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the operating loss for the industrial products segment for fiscal was  compared to  last year 
fiscal included an operating loss for july resulting principally from the consolidation of manufacturing operations and initial production of products new to chromium s cleveland  ohio plant 
excluding the results of july  chromium generated an operating profit for each month of fiscal operating losses included about  in fiscal and  in fiscal of nonrecurring items relating to the consolidation of chromium s manufacturing operations 
revenues and operating results for ortloff s patent licensing and engineering consulting services were lower in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities are generally the result of net income  deferred taxes  depreciation and amortization  and changes in working capital 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities were  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of higher net income and increased depreciation 
working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  increased by  primarily due to higher trade receivables 
trade receivables at june   increased  or  compared to june  as a result of higher sales volumes and increased deferred receivables 
at june   deferred term receivables from promotional programs to certain customers were  compared to  at june  deferred receivables outstanding at june  are due in the first quarter of fiscal lower inventories of premium laminated fiberglass shingles resulted from demand exceeding manufacturing capacity throughout fiscal  as the myerstown  pennsylvania plant ramped its production rate to design capacity 
inventory levels are expected to increase during the summer and fall roofing season as a result of higher manufacturing rates and somewhat slower demand 
the current ratio was to at june  compared to to at june  historically  working capital requirements fluctuate during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements and related borrowings are higher in the spring and summer months  and lower in the fall and winter months 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect the company s capital expenditure strategy 
net cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal after several years of expanding plant capacity aggressively  including the myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant  the company limited capital expenditures in fiscal to focus primarily on improving productivity at existing plants and extending production capacity for new products 
capital expenditures in fiscal are currently planned to be approximately  with about  of this total being expended in building products 
the company plans to invest approximately  over a two year period to construct a second shingle manufacturing line at its tuscaloosa  alabama roofing plant and install certain infrastructure and material handling improvements designed to enhance the overall efficiency of the expanded facility 
approximately  of the planned investment is projected to be expended in fiscal and the remaining  to be incurred in fiscal an additional  is planned in fiscal for productivity enhancements at certain of its other roofing plants 
remaining building product expenditures are for new warehouse sites and maintenance expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities generally reflect changes in the company s borrowings during the period  together with dividends paid on common stock  treasury stock transactions and exercises of stock options 
net cash used for financing activities was  in fiscal  compared to funds provided of  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  the company sold  in senior unsecured notes in a private placement transaction with a group of institutional investors 
the proceeds of the notes were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the company s existing revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the sale of these notes  the company reduced the total amount of its revolving credit facility from  to  there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility at june  the changes in the company s debt structure were made to extend the maturity structure of the company s debt on favorable terms  increase the total committed borrowing availability and better diversify the company s funding sources 
long term debt net of cash and cash equivalents represented of the  of invested capital long term debt  net of cash  plus shareholders equity at june  the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  limited purpose entities 
the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase of common stock from time to time on the open market 
as of june   the company has repurchase authority of approximately  remaining 
the following table summarizes the company s future payments relating to contractual obligations at june  payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   operating leases    total contractual obligations     the only significant commercial commitment the company has at june  is its  revolving credit facility  the term of which extends through november  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
such laws and regulations are frequently changed and could result in significantly increased cost of compliance 
certain of the company s manufacturing operations utilize hazardous materials in their production processes 
as a result  the company incurs costs for remediation activities off site and at its facilities from time to time 
the company establishes and maintains reserves for such remediation activities  when appropriate 
current reserves established for known or probable remediation activities are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
management believes that current cash and cash equivalents  projected cash flows from operations  and its existing restructured debt capacity should be sufficient during fiscal and beyond to fund the tuscaloosa  alabama plant expansion  other planned capital expenditures  working capital needs  dividends  stock repurchases and other cash requirements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
the accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following collectibility of accounts receivable the majority of the company s sales are in the building products segment and its primary customers are building material distributors 
due to consolidation in the industry  credit risk is concentrated 
ten customers typically account for about to of consolidated sales 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivables based on a combination of factors 
the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated on an ongoing basis based on such factors as customer s past payment history  length of time the receivables are past due  the status of customer s financial condition and ongoing credit evaluations 
accruals for loss contingencies contingencies  or uncertainties  by their nature  require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of loss 
key loss accruals for the company include product warranties  litigation  environmental matters  and self insurance reserves 
accruals are established for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be estimated reasonably 
accrual balances are reviewed and adjusted periodically based on management s judgment of changes in specific facts and circumstances for each loss accrual 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventories based on various factors 
for the building products segment  adjustments may be made to inventory values based on the physical condition eg age and quality of the inventories 
for the other  technologies segment companies  inventory adjustments are generally based upon the forecasted plans to sell its products and the sales prices that are expected to be realized 
inventories are adjusted to the lower of cost or market or written off if unsaleable 
these adjustments are estimates and can vary from actual requirements if inventories deteriorate  become otherwise damaged or obsolete  or if competitive conditions differ from expectations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
the company believes its revenue recognition policies are appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab the majority of sales are for manufactured products  where revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
such revenues  particularly in the building products segment  are subject to returns  discounts  volume rebates and other incentives  which are estimated and recorded based on sales activity and historical trends 
differences in revenues could result if actual experience differs from the historical trends used in management s estimates 
revenue recognition for service revenues and license fees may be subject to judgment and interpretation that the specific requirements of sab have been met 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  primarily plant  property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if the estimated sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  industry conditions  customer requirements  technology or the company s business model 
market risks in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices and interest rates 
the company has no significant foreign exchange risk 
derivatives are held as part of a formally documented risk management program 
derivatives are held to mitigate uncertainty  volatility or to cover underlying exposures 
no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
the company has entered into derivative transactions related to interest rate risk and its exposure to natural gas used in its manufacturing plants  as summarized in the following paragraphs 
the company is required to purchase natural gas for use in its manufacturing facilities 
these purchases expose the company to the risk of higher natural gas prices 
to hedge this risk  the company has entered into hedge transactions to fix the price on of its projected natural gas usage through october it is anticipated that similar hedging strategies will be utilized in the future 
the fair value of the hedges for natural gas was a gain of approximately   net of tax at june  the company uses interest rate swaps to help maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt 
the company has entered into a receive fixed  pay floating interest rate swap on  or of its outstanding debt at june  the fair value of this swap was a loss of  at june  based on outstanding debt at june   the company s interest costs would increase or decrease  for each theoretical increase or decrease in the floating interest rate 
credit risk the company is subject to credit risks applicable to cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions or in short term investments with high credit quality 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable primarily relate to the large building material distributors that are the company s primary customers 
the company s largest customer accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal and in fiscal the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company has not experienced significant credit losses for many years 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to those customers to whom the company makes significant sales 
inflation and changing prices the company s primary financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america based on historical dollars 
accordingly  the financial statements do not portray the effects of inflation 
in recent years  inflation in the company s key markets has been moderate 
cost controls and improving productivity generally minimize the impact of inflation 
the costs of manufacturing  transportation and key raw materials  including but not limited to ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler  together with the company s ability to pass along higher costs  are generally influenced by factors other than inflation 
these factors include general economic and industry conditions  supply and demand  surpluses and shortages  and actions of key competitors 
forward looking statements in an effort to give investors a well rounded view of the company s current condition and future opportunities  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about its prospects for the future 
the statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements usually are accompanied by words such as believe  estimate  project  expect  anticipate  predict  outlook  plan  potential  could  should  may  or similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
these statements are based on judgments the company believes are reasonable  however  elkcorp s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences could include  but are not limited to changes in demand or prices  changes in raw material or transportation costs  raw material or transportation shortages  changes in economic conditions of the various markets the company serves  changes in the amount and severity of inclement weather  actions of competitors  new and planned facilities not meeting expected productivity rates and projected financial results  and technological changes  together with other risks detailed herein  as well as in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  including  but not limited to its form k dated august  factors that could affect the company s future business and results include the following the company s building products business is substantially non cyclical  but can be affected by weather  the availability of financing  insurance claims paying practices  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the asphalt roofing products manufacturing business is highly competitive 
actions of competitors  including changes in pricing  or slowing demand for asphalt roofing products due to general or industry economic conditions or the amount of inclement weather could result in decreased demand for the company s products  lower prices received or reduced utilization of plant facilities 
further  changes in building and insurance codes and other standards from time to time can cause changes in demand  or increases in costs that may not be passed through to customers 
in the building products business  the significant raw materials are ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler 
increased costs of raw materials can result in reduced margins  as can higher energy  trucking and rail costs 
furthermore  temporary shortages or disruption in supply of raw materials or transportation do result from time to time from a variety of causes 
historically  the company has been able to pass some of the higher raw material  energy and transportation costs through to the customer 
should the company be unable to recover higher raw material  energy and or transportation costs from price increases of its products  or if the company experiences temporary shortages or disruption of supply of raw material or transportation  operating results could be adversely affected and or lower than projected 
the company has been involved in a significant expansion plan over the past several years  including the construction of new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities 
progress in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and financial results is difficult to predict for new and expanded plant facilities 
if such progress is slower than anticipated  or if demand for products produced at new or expanded plants does not meet current expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
certain facilities of the company s subsidiaries must utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the company could incur costs for remediation activities at its facilities or off site  and other related exposures from time to time in excess of established reserves for such activities 
the company s litigation is subject to inherent and case specific uncertainty 
the outcome of such litigation depends on numerous interrelated factors  many of which cannot be predicted 
although the company currently anticipates that most of its needs for new capital in the near future will be met with internally generated funds or borrowings under its available credit facilities  significant increases in interest rates could substantially affect its borrowing costs under its existing loan facility  or its cost of alternative sources of capital 
each of the company s businesses  especially cybershield s business  is subject to the risks of technological changes and competition that is based or technology improvement or labor savings 
these factors could affect the demand for or the relative cost of the company s technology  products and services  or the method and profitability of the method of distribution or delivery of such technology  products and services 
in addition  the company s businesses each could suffer significant setbacks in revenues and operating income if it lost one or more of its largest customers  or if its customers plans and or markets should change significantly 
cybershield has lost substantial business as a result of most cellular handset production moving to asia where cybershield has no significant presence 
low labor costs make other coating processes competitive with those cybershield would use 
cybershield s future viability may depend on the successful commercialization of the exact process  or other value added services  which are unproven as yet on a large commercial scale 
although the company insures itself against physical loss to its manufacturing facilities  including business interruption losses  natural or other disasters and accidents  including but not limited to fire  earthquake  damaging winds  and explosions  operating results could be adversely affected if any of its manufacturing facilities became inoperable for an extended period of time due to such events 
each of the company s businesses is actively involved in the development of new products  processes and services which are expected to contribute to the company s ongoing long term growth and earnings 
if such development activities are not successful  market demand is less than expected  or the company cannot provide the requisite financial and other resources to successfully commercialize such developments  the growth of future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking beliefs or judgments in making investment decisions
