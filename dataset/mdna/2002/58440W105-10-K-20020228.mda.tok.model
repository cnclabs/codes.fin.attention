we derive our sales from the licensing of our content creation software  from the sale of our content creation systems  and from services in the form of annual contracts supporting our software and systems 
in the case of software and systems  we recognize revenue upon shipment or distribution over the internet to a customer provided there exists persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the license fee is fixed or determinable  a determination has been made by management that the collection is probable and the company has no remaining obligations 
in the case of services that support our software and systems products  called platinum services  we recognize revenue ratably over the life of the service contract 
our total net sales from continuing operations for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal net sales from products for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease in net sales from products is due to a number of factors including lower unit sales of both the macintosh and windows operating platforms and lower average selling prices for our content creation systems decrease of million and lower sales of our mpeg based products decrease of million 
we attribute the decrease in sales of our content creation systems to increased competition and lower demand and anticipate this trend in lower year over year sales will continue for the media i and ifinish products currently shipping in fiscal net sales from services for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease in net sales from services is the result of lower sales of service contracts due to lower unit sales of our content creation systems and the elimination of encoding and hosting services 
no customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in fiscal or fiscal net sales from customers outside of north america accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
with the announcement of the company s recently introduced product  x  we are continuing to develop our indirect distribution channels in north america  europe  asia and latin america and currently anticipate that customers outside the north america will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales  and as a percentage of net sales  to remain approximately the same 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for products consists of the cost of manufacturing pci hardware boards for our content creation systems and royalties paid to third parties for their software that has been integrated into our systems 
cost of sales also includes the cost of manuals and other product documentation  shipping costs and related labor 
cost of sales for our service offerings consists of salaries and related expenses for service personnel delivering the service to the customer  and warranty costs 
total cost of sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales is directly related to the lower unit sales of our content creation systems 
gross profit 
our gross profit from continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal overall gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of products decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  while gross profit as a percentage of net sales of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit for products in fiscal over fiscal was the result of the reduction in average selling prices of our content creation systems as well as a decrease in overall unit sales 
the decrease in gross profit for services in fiscal over fiscal was the result of encoding and hosting services  which carry a lower gross profit than our platinum services 
the company no longer provides encoding and hosting services 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop and improve our existing intellectual property and develop new intellectual property and are charged to expense as incurred 
to date  development costs for our systems have been charged to expense as incurred  because the costs incurred from the attainment of technological feasibility to general product release have not been significant 
our research and development costs may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the nature of the products under development 
some of our systems have pci hardware included in the product and the costs associated with designing and developing this type of hardware can be expensive 
in addition  our software developers require this hardware in order to integrate the software code they develop with the hardware to create a fully integrated content creation system 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the majority of the decrease in research and development expenses represented lower development costs associated with our existing content creation systems  media i and ifinish 
we currently anticipate our research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal versus fiscal because we believe that ongoing maintenance costs and costs of improvements to our recently announced product  x  will not be as high in fiscal as the development costs for the first version in prior years 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel  commissions and marketing costs such as advertising  trade shows  marketing materials  lead generation activities and public relations 
our selling and marketing expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and sales commissions  which vary based on sales 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of lower sales of our content creation systems  we reduced our expenses for salaries  employee related costs  tradeshows  outside services  sales literature and direct mail 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from lower sales of our content creation systems as discussed above 
we currently anticipate that our selling and marketing expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal versus fiscal as a result of our implementation of a restructuring and cost reduction plan implemented in the second half of fiscal this restructuring plan included reducing our european subsidiaries  which are primarily comprised of selling and marketing personnel  from four to three and reducing personnel in the three remaining subsidiaries 
some of these cost savings will be offset by increased marketing costs to introduce our recently announced product  x 
the increase in marketing spending for x will include higher costs for advertising  sales and marketing collateral  and seminars 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel and outside services for human resources  finance  information technology  legal  and other administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from a legal accrual established for an unfavorable verdict in a lawsuit against the company and estimated legal fees in the amount of million  and increased expenses for legal  audit  salaries and employee related costs 
we currently anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal as we begin to realize expense efficiencies as a result of our streamlining initiatives of the general and administrative functions  which occurred in the second half of fiscal amortization of intangible assets 
we recorded expense for the amortization and write off of intangible assets of million in fiscal related to the acquisitions of wired  st century media  j digital media and certain assets of integrated computing engines  inc in fiscal  we recorded amortization expense of million related to the acquisitions mentioned above 
in fiscal  we expect our amortization expense will be approximately million for these acquisitions and will amortize all remaining goodwill by the end of the fiscal year acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of wired  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development projects in fiscal this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
we did not incur any expense for acquired in process research and development in fiscal restructuring 
in fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align our organization with our corporate strategy and to reflect the consolidation of several companies we acquired in the past two years 
we recorded million of restructuring expense in fiscal to reduce operating expenses in the organization 
the major component of the restructuring charge relates to the termination of employment of personnel across these functions 
at november   approximately  of the accrued restructuring charge remained to be paid  composed of severance related costs associated with the termination of employment of personnel and rent expense  net of sublease income  associated with the streamriver division of approximately  the total cash impact of the restructuring amounted to approximately million  of which approximately  was paid in in fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and incurred a restructuring expense of  the major component of this restructuring charge related to the termination of employment of personnel in the selling and marketing and general and administrative functions 
at november   there was no remaining obligation under the fiscal restructuring plan 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income  net  resulted from lower cash and cash equivalents due primarily to the net loss incurred in fiscal  the use of cash for the acquisitions of terran  wired  st century media  j digital media  substantially all of the assets of ice  the merger with digital origin and lower interest rates available on the financial instruments we have chosen for investment 
we currently anticipate that interest income will decline in fiscal versus due to lower interest rates on the financial instruments we have chosen for investment 
other expense  net 
other expense  net increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off our investment of million in beatnik  an early stage company which was developing audio software solutions for mobile devices  after management made a determination that this asset was no longer realizable 
this determination was made due to a weakening market as well as weakened prospects for a liquidity event 
the remaining expense for fiscal and was primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses of  and  respectively  related to our four european subsidiaries 
the increase in over was primarily related to exchange fluctuations 
tax benefit 
we recorded a tax benefit in fiscal of million on our loss from continuing operations 
this was offset by a net tax provision of million on the gain from the sale of our streaming media software product line and the operating results of the discontinued operations 
we did not require a tax provision in fiscal due to the net loss recorded during the fiscal year ended november  net loss from continuing operation 
as a result of the above factors  we recorded a net loss from continuing operations in fiscal in the amount of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal income loss from discontinued operations 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes was million  or per share  consisting of a gain on the sale of the streaming media software product line of million  offset by a loss from discontinued operations of million 
in  the net loss from discontinued operations was million  or per share 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales 
our total net sales from continuing operations for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal net sales from products for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal the decrease in net sales from products was due primarily lower unit shipments and lower average selling price of our content creation systems  partially offset by sales from products from the acquisitions of wired  inc and certain assets of integrated computing engines  inc no customer accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal or fiscal net sales from services for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal the increase in net sales from services was primarily due to the launch of new services for encoding and hosting digital media as a result of the acquisitions of st century media and j digital media 
net sales from customers outside of north america accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of sales

research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the majority of the decrease in research and development expenses represented lower development costs due to the completion of ifinish  the company s high performance windows nt based product line  which began shipping in the first quarter of fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  travel  commissions  and marketing costs such as advertising  trade shows  marketing materials  lead generation activities and public relations

the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increased legal costs associated with two lawsuits 
amortization of intangible assets 
we recorded an expense for the amortization of intangible assets of million in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions of wired  inc  st century media  j digital media and certain assets of integrated computing engines  inc there was no similar expense recorded in fiscal as all of these companies were acquired in fiscal acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of wired  inc  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date

all amounts under the plan have been paid 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in interest income  net  is due primarily to lower average cash and cash equivalents in fiscal relative to fiscal other expense  net 
other expense  net  increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the expense for fiscal and was primarily due to foreign currency transactions losses related to our four european subsidiaries 
tax benefit 
we did not require a tax provision nor did we record a tax benefit in fiscal or fiscal due to the net loss incurred for fiscal and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits available to the company to offset against income for fiscal net income loss from continuing operations 
as a result of the above factors  we recorded a net loss of million in fiscal  or per share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  in fiscal income loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations was million  or per share in compared to net income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date primarily from public offerings of equity securities and cash flows from operations  as well as the sale of our streaming media software product line to autodesk 
as of november   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
this was a decrease of approximately  from the million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we had as of november  in addition to the million as of november   an additional million is held in escrow until october as a result of the sale of our streaming media software product line to autodesk  inc in october during fiscal  cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was approximately million compared to cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of approximately million for fiscal cash provided by discontinued operations for fiscal totaled million compared to cash used in discontinued operations for fiscal of million

net cash provided by investing activities for continuing operations was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million for fiscal cash provided by investing activities for continuing operations during was derived from the proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million and a reduction in other assets of million  partially offset by purchases of capital equipment of  and the costs for patents and trademarks of  cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during was approximately million compared to cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of million for fiscal in  cash used in financing activities from continuing operations included a payment of million on a note payable and the purchase of treasury stock of  partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock plans of  we currently anticipate that our current cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to raise additional funds  however  in order to fund expansion of our business  develop new and enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership or our stockholders may be reduced  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance our products or services would be significantly limited 
cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would decline 
risks associated with development and introduction of new products 
if we are not successful in developing and introducing new products to the markets we serve our business and operating results will suffer 
in late february  we announced our latest new product  x  and currently anticipate this new product will generate greater than of the revenue from product sales in the current fiscal year 
if the adoption of x is slower than we anticipate or if there are delays in releasing x  our current revenue expectations may be too high and our operating results may be negatively affected 
in addition  new product announcements by our competitors and other new product announcements by us could have the effect of reducing customer demand for our existing products 
also  when we introduce new or enhanced products we must effectively manage the transitions from existing products to minimize disruption of orders from our customers 
new product introductions require us to devote time and resources to the training of our sales channel in the features and target customers for such new products  which efforts could result in less selling efforts being made by the sales channel during such training period 
our failure to effectively manage new product announcements or introductions could contribute to significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline and  as a result  our operating results will suffer 
significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict  have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future for a number of reasons  including new product announcements and introductions by ourselves or our competitors  changes in pricing  and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
also  in the past  we have experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancements  and such delays may occur in the future 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
additionally  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed  and operating expense levels are based primarily on internal expectations of future revenue 
as a consequence  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if quarterly revenue or earnings levels fail to meet internal or external expectations  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
emerging markets 
the markets in which we offer our systems products and services are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we are targeting the emerging market of broadcast designers  effects artists  and creative professionals 
this market and the products utilized by these users are relatively new 
our success in this emerging market will depend on the rate at which the market develops and our ability to penetrate that market 
we will not succeed if we cannot compete effectively in this market and  as a result  our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
rapid technological change 
rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions characterize the market for our products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products and features in a timely manner to address customer requirements  respond to competitive offerings  adapt to new emerging industry standards and take advantage of new enabling technologies that could render our existing products obsolete 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development  in connection with our development strategy 
any delay or failure on our part in developing additional new products or features for existing products or any failure of such new products or features to achieve market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and our stock price will suffer 
competition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features and accelerate the release of new products 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with our products  including accom  inc  adobe systems inc  apple computer  inc  avid technology  inc  discreet a division of autodesk  inc  leitch  inc  matrox electronic systems ltd  pinnacle systems  inc and quantel ltd 
in addition  we expect much larger vendors  such as matsushita electric industrial company ltd  microsoft corporation  and sony corporation  to develop and introduce digital editing systems that may compete with our products 
many of these current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have  including  without limitation  larger and more established selling and marketing capabilities  greater brand recognition and a larger installed base of customers  and well established relationships with our existing and potential customers  complementary technology vendors and other business partners 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop products comparable to or superior to our own products  adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  or lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which we could not operate profitably  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in this regard  we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressure to reduce prices  particularly for our high data rate systems 
we have historically realized higher gross profit on the sale of these high data rate systems  and such continued competitive pricing pressure could result in lower sales and gross margin  which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on propriety technology 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
previously  we have received  and may in the future continue to receive  communications suggesting that our products may infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
our policy is to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products  or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that these or other future communications can be settled on commercially reasonable terms or that they will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
any failure to secure the necessary intellectual property right of third parties on commercially reasonable terms may adversely affect our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
risks of third party claims of infringement 
there has been substantial industry litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us or to enforce trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us  to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
for a description of certain pending litigation instituted against the company  see item  legal proceedings of part i  other information and note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
any such litigation could be costly and a diversion of management s attention  which could adversely affect our business and operating results and our financial condition 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results and our financial condition 
dependence on single or limited source suppliers 
the company is dependent on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in its products that have no ready substitutes  including various audio and video signal processing integrated circuits manufactured in each case only by crystal semiconductor corp  fairchild semiconductor corp  gennum corporation  toshiba  kawasaki lsi usa inc  lsi logic corp  philips semiconductors or zoran corp 
the availability of many of these components is dependent on our ability to provide suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements  and certain components we use to build our products have been subject to industry wide shortages 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that our inventory levels will be adequate to meet production needs during any interruption of supply 
our inability to develop alternative supply sources  if required  or a reduction or stoppage in supply  could delay product shipments until new sources of supply become available  and any such delay could adversely affect our business and operating results in any given period and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on key personnel 
competition for employees with the skills required by us is intense in the geographic areas in which we maintain physical operations 
we believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees  especially in research and development 
any significant delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on and competition with apple computer  inc as a competitor  apple computer  inc apple could  in the future  inhibit our ability to develop our products that operate on the macintosh platform 
additionally  new products and enhancements to existing products from apple such as final cut pro could cause customers to delay purchases of our products or alter their purchase decision altogether 
furthermore  as the sole supplier of macintosh computers  any disruption in the availability of these computers could cause customers to defer or alter their purchase of our products 
we rely on access to key information from apple to continue development of our products and any failure to continue supplying our engineers with this information could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on microsoft corporation 
many of our products operate in the windows environment and our engineers depend upon access to information in advance from microsoft corporation microsoft 
any failure to continue supplying our engineers with this information could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
dependence on distributors and resellers 
we rely primarily on our worldwide network of independent distributors and value added resellers vars to distribute and sell our products to end users 
our distributors and resellers generally offer products from several different companies  including in some cases products that are competitive with our own products 
in addition  many of the vars are small organizations with limited capital resources 
there can be no assurance that our distributors and resellers will continue to purchase products from us  or that our efforts to expand our network of distributors and resellers will be successful 
any significant failure on our part to maintain or expand our network of distributors and resellers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
reliance on international sales 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  less effective enforcement of proprietary rights  currency exchange fluctuations  generally longer collection periods  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international resellers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
our international sales are also subject to more seasonal fluctuation than domestic sales 
in this regard  the traditional summer vacation period  which occurs during our third fiscal quarter  may result in a decrease in sales  particularly in europe 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on our future international operations and consequently  on our business and operating results 
this fluctuation may be material and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
merger and acquisition related risks 
during the fiscal year ended november   we completed the merger with digital origin and the acquisitions of wired  st century media  and j digital media 
in addition  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of integrated computing engines  inc our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the event we fail to complete publicly announced acquisitions or to successfully integrate the business and operations of the merger or the acquisitions 
in the future  we may continue to acquire or merge with existing businesses  products  and technologies to enhance and expand our line of products 
such mergers and acquisitions may be material in size and in scope 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our business without substantial expenses  delays  or other operational or financial problems 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and factors  including increasing competition for attractive acquisition candidates in our markets  the technological enhancement and incorporation of acquired products into existing product lines and services  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  failure to retain key acquired personnel  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities of any acquired companies  the failure to achieve anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies  as well as the diversion of management s attention during the acquisition and integration process 
we may not be able to operate the acquired businesses properly and may not be able to successfully recover amounts paid for such businesses 
some or all of these special risks and factors may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition and  as a result  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
similarly  we may dispose of assets  either assets we have historically used in the business or that we have acquired 
our business and results of operations could materially change depending on whether or not we are able to dispose of assets in an advantageous manner 
in addition to obtaining an advantageous price for the assets to be disposed of  dispositions involve a number of special risks and factors  including searching for appropriate acquirers  managing the effect of the disposition on existing and proposed product lines and services  the divestiture of operations and personnel  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  potential post divestiture indemnification or liability for liabilities of divested operations  as well as the diversion of management s attention during the disposition process 
some or all of these special risks and factors may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition and  as a result  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
history of losses 
we have incurred substantial operating losses during the current year and in three of the past four fiscal years 
we incurred an operating loss from continuing operations of approximately million for fiscal and as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the past four years we have significantly increased our research and development expenses as a percentage of total sales and we plan to continue to invest in new technology  and as a result  we may incur operating losses in future periods 
we will need to generate increases in our current sales levels to achieve profitability and we may not be able to do so 
if our sales grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenue  our business will be significantly and adversely affected 
our failure to achieve profitability or achieve the level of profitability expected by investors and securities analysts may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
stock price volatility 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low of per share and a high of per share 
we believe that the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors  and the market for our products and services  many of which are beyond our control  such as  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of companies in our markets  announcements by us or our competitors of significant products  acquisitions  or strategic partnerships  failure to complete significant business transactions  departures of key personnel  purchases or sales of common stock or other securities by us  or news relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility over the past twelve months 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance
