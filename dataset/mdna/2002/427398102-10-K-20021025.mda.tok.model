as part of its oversight responsibilities  management continually evaluates the propriety of its accounting methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of the company s financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
revenue under certain long term  fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue recognized on these contracts is based on estimated completion to date the total contract amount multiplied by percent of performance  based on total costs incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of inventoriable manufacturing costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded when first reasonably determinable 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the ultimate manufacturing costs 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements
