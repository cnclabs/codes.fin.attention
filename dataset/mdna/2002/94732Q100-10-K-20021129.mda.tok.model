corporate strategy interland s continuing strategic objective is to be the leading provider of standardized web hosting products and services to small and medium sized businesses 
the company intends to profitably serve its target market by achieving scale and efficiency in its operations 
interland believes the most profitable segment of the web hosting market is serving small and medium sized businesses smb s 
this market is large  growing and may be served with standardized products and services 
standardization of products and services permits the use of standardized processes  and of a higher degree of automation in many areas of operation  including the sales process 
this approach stands in sharp contrast to that of other web hosting companies which focus on providing labor intensive  customized solutions to larger enterprises 
by delivering business class web hosting solutions for smb s in a scaleable and efficient manner  interland believes that it can offer better value to its customers  leading to growing market share and profits 
on the other hand  certain aspects of the smb market present substantial challenges and risks 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors interland s target market presents substantial risks 
the primary goal of the merger of micron electronics  inc mei and interland georgia in fiscal  and of the subsequent acquisitions  was to create a new company with much greater scale 
in order to maximize the benefits of its new size  the company has undergone and continued to execute a rigorous merger and integration process in fiscal this process has resulted in the identification and execution of numerous cost synergy initiatives  greatly enhancing the company s operational efficiency 
to further accelerate its profitability objectives  the company has embarked in fiscal on an effort to acquire additional web hosting accounts from its competitors 
the company believes that its acquisition strategy will permit the company to spread its fixed costs over a larger base  and to derive a greater percentage of profit from incremental revenues 
interland s fundamental strategy for fiscal is to integrate all acquired accounts and assets into a centralized and efficient infrastructure 
at the same time  the company is implementing a number of system and environmental improvement programs 
the objective is to create a stable base upon which interland can deploy its organic growth strategy through fiscal and beyond 
finally  the company enjoys a strong financial position with low debt  a substantial cash balance and  as a result  a business that is not expected to require additional capitalization in order to fulfill its strategic goals 
products and services interland offers an integrated suite of web and applications hosting and related business services designed to specifically address the needs of small and medium sized businesses 
these services include shared hosting  dedicated hosting and managed services  e commerce and other applications hosting services  domain name registration services  and other web hosting related products and services 
most of the company s hosting revenues are generated from recurring monthly fees 
the remainder is derived from one time setup fees for installation 
the company commonly sells its services under agreements having terms of one to twenty four months  but provides that the customer may nonetheless cancel during an initial thirty day trial period 
customers pay for the services either in a lump sum in advance  or monthly  but the company has instituted a process of converting as many customers as possible to monthly payments 
during fiscal  the company derived of its revenues from hosting and other hosting related services 
the balance of the revenues was generated primarily by other related services 

table of contents shared hosting shared hosting services range from entry level starter packages to business e commerce shared web hosting products 
interland s shared hosting packages minimize the cost for customers by providing hosting services for multiple customers on a single shared server  spreading the cost of the service over many users 
starter packages are designed for web sites with relatively low volumes of traffic and provide a web presence at minimal cost 
the company s products are scalable solutions that make it simple to upgrade to more full featured services 
the majority of the company s customers currently use its shared hosting services 
interland s services feature easy to use control panels and extensive on line documentation that allow customers to easily control their own applications 
business e commerce packages feature important e commerce services including secure socket layer encryption for e commerce transactions  shopping carts and database technology to conduct product and service sales online 
through the company s other business relationships  its customers can also obtain merchant account and online payment processing services 
on september  the company introduced a new shared hosting product  bluehalo  which is designed to integrate network operations onto a common architecture and to implement a full suite of internal systems to support the company s hosting services 
this product positions the company as a market leader by enabling it to deliver a new hosting standard based on technology that is designed to provide greater reliability and performance 
key technical features of bluehalo include redundant firewall protection  load balancing  multiple web server arrays  duplicate network attached storage units and a disk backup system 
dedicated hosting in contrast to a shared hosting environment  which hosts multiple customers on one server  dedicated hosting employs one or more servers dedicated to a single customer 
dedicated hosting provides a customer with increased performance  server access  the ability to use custom applications  greater security and higher levels of technical support 
interland provides both managed and unmanaged dedicated services 
for dedicated managed hosting services  the company monitors  administers and troubleshoots the software that operates the client server 
for unmanaged dedicated hosting services  the customer administers the server remotely  with the company providing the hardware monitoring and network and hardware support 
dedicated hosting services are targeted for web sites that generally require sophisticated databases for critical application needs or typically experience high user traffic volumes 
the company s managed services are targeted to those who need the complex services required for mission critical web sites  but do not want to administer their own server 
the dedicated services come with proprietary control panel technology  which enables customers to setup and maintain web sites on the server 
interland offers dedicated web hosting services for major computer platforms  including microsoft nt  windows and linux 
since its acquisition of dialtone  interland has achieved a leadership position in the dedicated hosting market 
e commerce and other applications hosting services interland s applications hosting services allow customers to outsource to it the deployment  configuration  hosting  management and support of various software applications 
the company s applications hosting services allow customers to deploy a software application more quickly and with reduced initial costs 
in addition  many small and medium sized businesses do not have the internal technical resources to support multiple software applications 
the company therefore believes that outsourcing these functions to it is a desirable alternative for these businesses 
the types of applications the company hosts for customers include collaboration tools  business tools  mail service tools and e commerce applications 
currently  the applications the company hosts consist mainly of microsoft exchange server  office server extension and various e commerce and security products 
other web hosting related products and services interland also makes available other complementary products and services including domain name registration  web site design  technical consulting and web site marketing tools 
the company believes these value added products and services will enable it to provide its customers with a single vendor with the necessary tools to create  host and maintain a successful web presence 
the company believes that the outsourcing of these functions is a desirable and increasingly preferred alternative for small and medium sized businesses

other marketing activities include participation in industry events and affiliate relationships  including cooperative marketing with related services 
key strategic relationships interland has established and intends to continue to forge strategic relationships with leading technology providers  including major software  hardware  development and internet marketing organizations  to enhance its products and services 
these relationships enable the company to more quickly gain access to innovative technologies  to provide more creative solutions for its customers and to allow it to offer its customers resources that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for them to acquire 
the company is also able to build upon the research  development and expertise of these companies in developing and launching new products 
the company believes that these relationships will enable it to continue to provide its customers with the necessary tools to create  host and maintain a successful web presence and to have access to sophisticated e commerce and applications solutions 
these relationships also provide the company with opportunities to market to customers to which it might not otherwise have access

the agreement expires in to date the development of the software has not been completed and released 
verizon on october   the company entered into a business relationship with verizon  a leading provider of communications and information services 
under this service provider relationship  verizon has the right to market and sell a version of the company s products and services to its business customers 
terms of the relationship run through october  customers interland typically provides hosting services directly to end user business customers 
the company also provides hosting services to web developers  web consulting firms and other organizations that bundle the company s services with their own products or services for sale to their end user customers 
as of august   the company had approximately  paid shared hosting customer accounts and managed more than  dedicated servers  many of which have multiple web sites 
network infrastructure  technology and operations to provide a secure and reliable hosting environment  interland has constructed a managed infrastructure  consisting of data centers  a redundant internet communications backbone  enterprise management software and an advanced network 
the company operates data centers in atlanta  georgia  los angeles  california  seattle  washington  kansas city  missouri  and in miami and fort lauderdale  florida 

table of contents data centers the primary data centers  located in atlanta  georgia and miami  florida include network operations centers that are managed and monitored hours per day  every day of the year  monitoring of all critical systems  redundant network hardware  parallel redundant backup power generators  fire suppression systems  cooling systems that include independent full grade mechanical systems  security  including security guards and video monitoring and entry restriction via access devices  and multiple tier backbones providing internet connectivity 
proprietary technology in addition to bluehalo  interland has developed various proprietary technologies that are designed to allow customers to order  change and manage their web hosting accounts easily regardless of their level of technical expertise 
proprietary technologies also enable the company to automate a number of back end functions and processes 
for example  the company s provisioning system automatically activates customer initiated web site changes within minutes of its entry 
the company s administration page technology lets customers modify their web sites from the internet without having to contact the company s support staff 
this technology provides the company with the opportunity to achieve greater operational efficiencies and allows the customer to change passwords  protect specific directories  and to create database sources without the assistance of the company s technical support staff 
although the company believes that its suite of technology offers its customers significant benefits  the company does not believe that its competitive advantage depends upon protected intellectual property 
network operations centers interland monitors its network operations hours a day  every day of the year with technical experts in windows and nt and linux operating platforms 
the network operations center personnel monitor each piece of equipment  including routers  switches and servers  as well as all internet and communication connections 
the systems used in the network operations centers are designed to allow its systems engineers and administrators and support staff to be promptly alerted to problems  and the company has documented procedures for rapidly resolving technical problems that arise 
international revenues interland s international revenues from continuing operations totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
international revenues are denominated and paid in us dollars 
these amounts represent revenues from international customers generated and supported in the us however the company has no network operations outside of the united states 
competition interland believes that the primary competitive factors in the mass market segment of the internet web hosting industry include features  customer service  ease of use and price 
at the higher end of the market  reliability and technical expertise tend to drive the purchasing decision 
although the market is intensely competitive  the company believes that it compares favorably with its competition on the mass market dimensions 
current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms that provide a wide array of information technology services and computer hardware suppliers 
the company s competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as affinity internet  xo communications  verio and rackspace 
the small and medium size business  or smb  hosting market is highly fragmented  with a large number of competitors  most of whom have market share of less than 
interland believes it has a market share of 
table of contents approximately  placing the company in the industry s leading position  and that its next closest competitor is verio 
there also are numerous smaller web hosting providers  and other companies that offer web hosting not as their main product line  for instance  internet service providers  competitive local exchange carriers  and internet companies such as yahoo and amazon 
the company does not consider itself to be in direct competition with companies such as worldcom or exodus 
those companies provide high end services that are highly customized  require the user to have technical expertise and generally fall at a price point of several thousand dollars per month 
interland s solutions are standardized  do not require the user to have technical expertise  and begin at a price point of approximately per month 
interland believes that it can sell standardized solutions to a larger customer base on a more efficient and profitable basis than can providers of high end  customized solutions 
intellectual property interland relies on a combination of laws including patent  copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its services 
as of august   the company owned three issued us patents and had thirty four additional patent applications on file but not yet issued 
patent no 
b issued march  is for database access using active server pages and expires november  patent no 
issued december   is also for database access using active server pages and expires november  patent no 
b issued april   is for computer storage systems for computer facilities and expires march  interland has entered into confidentiality and other agreements with its employees and contractors  including agreements in which the employees and contractors assign their rights in inventions to it 
it has also entered into nondisclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and some customers in order to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
nonetheless  neither the intellectual property laws nor contractual arrangements  nor any of the other steps the company has taken to protect its intellectual property can ensure that others will not use its technology  or that others will not develop similar technologies 
interland licenses or leases many technologies used in its internet application services 
the company expects that it and its customers increasingly will be subject to third party infringement claims as the number of web sites and third party service providers for web based businesses grows 
although the company does not believe that its technologies or services infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  the company can not be sure that third parties will not assert claims against it in the future or that these claims will not be successful 
although it has discontinued operations as a manufacturer of personal computers in the electronics industry  the company is nonetheless subject to litigation arising from its past activities 
it is not uncommon in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and personal computer manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it has used in these discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operations products or processes  it may be legally liable to the owner of such intellectual property 
moreover  even in those instances where the company is justified in denying claims that it has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  it may nonetheless be forced to defend legal actions taken against the company relating to allegedly protected technology  and such legal actions may require the company to expend substantial funds

government regulation interland is not currently subject to direct federal  state or local government regulation  other than regulations that apply to businesses generally 
this could change in the future see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors interland s business may be impacted by government regulation and legal uncertainties 
employees the company employs approximately individuals as of august  all of the company s employees are located in the united states  and none is represented by a labor organization with respect to 
table of contents employment by the company 
as of august   the company has never had an organized work stoppage and it considers its employee relations to be satisfactory 
environmental regulations some risks of costs and liabilities related to environmental matters have been inherent in the company s discontinued operations  as with many similar businesses  and its operations are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental regulatory requirements relating to environmental and waste management 
in connection with the company s discontinued operations  it periodically generated and handled limited amounts of materials that were considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
the company contracted for the off site disposal of these materials 
the company believes it has operated in compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
the company employs diesel fuel to power some of its backup generators 
this fuel is stored in tanks which must be monitored to avoid spills and leaks  which could lead to violation of environmental regulations 
the company believes it employs appropriate safeguards to comply with applicable regulations

item legal proceedings interland defended a contract dispute lawsuit filed on october   in dallas county  texas court seeking damages of approximately million for goods purchased by our pc systems business 
the company removed the case to federal court and counterclaimed for legal fees owed by the plaintiff for legal fees they had agreed to indemnify the company for that were incurred on an unrelated patent lawsuit 
these legal fees amounted to approximately million 
this claim was settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal for million 
interland is defending an employee class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for idaho 
in this case five individual plaintiffs claim they were employees of micron electronics inc met between and april the plaintiff s claim that they  and other similarly situated employees  did not receive overtime pay to which they were entitled under the fair labor standards act 
interland disputes these claims and believes the plaintiffs were not entitled to any material additional wages 
the court conditionally certified a class of not more than former employees and notices of the litigation are being sent to these persons to give them the opportunity to opt in to the litigation 
the parties are continuing to conduct discovery 
at this early stage of the litigation interland is unable to estimate its total expenses  possible loss or range of loss that may ultimately be connected with the matter 
this potential liability remains with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operation s products or processes  it may be forced to defend legal across taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the company evaluates all such claims and has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the respective dates of the balance sheets included in this report 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies the company has adequately reserved for the contingencies arising from the above legal matters where an outcome was deemed to probable and the loss amount could be reasonably estimated 
as such  the company does not believe that the anticipated outcome of the aforementioned proceedings will have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations or financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates management based this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
revenue recognition revenues from continuing operations are primarily from shared and dedicated internet web hosting services 
hosting contracts generally are for service periods ranging from one to twenty four months and include one time set up fees 
although billings are in advance of service delivery  the company defers revenue recognition until the services are provided and revenue is earned 
the initial set up fees are deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the customer s service period 
deferred revenue on the company s consolidated balance sheet represent the liability for advance billings to customers for services not yet provided 
since the company does allow for free cancellations during the first day period  a provision has been established for estimated cancellations 
valuation of accounts receivable judgment is required when the company assesses the likelihood of ultimate realization of recorded accounts receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of our customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  or their operating climate were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
due to the competition in the market place  the company has experienced a decline in our average monthly revenue per customer from in fiscal to in fiscal  and continues to experience average monthly customer turnover rates in the to range for and significant portions of customer payments are made by credit card 
each month management reviews historical charge back and cancellation patterns and records an allowance based on historical results 
additionally  each month 
table of contents management reviews the aged receivables balance and records an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the age of the outstanding receivable balances and trends in outstanding balances 
as a result of these analyses  the company believes that the current allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate to cover any bad debts as of the date of the balance sheet 
the company has experienced an increase in bad debt expense and customer turnover during the account migration and integration process following our acquisitions 
property  plant  equipment and long lived assets the company utilizes significant amounts of property  plant and equipment in providing service to our customers 
for financial statement reporting purposes the company uses straight line depreciation for property and equipment over our estimate of their useful lives 
the company uses estimated useful lives of two to ten years for equipment and software 
changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we perform an annual analysis to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of property  plant  and equipment 
additionally  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
estimates and assumptions used in both setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability require management judgment 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
the company periodically evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment 
the company tests for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets annually by determining whether the company s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is ascertained by using quoted values of the company s stock and by using discounted values of expected future cash flows 
if impairment exists  we measure the impairment through the use of discounted cash flows 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions  and operational considerations 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to impairment tests at least annually 
other intangible assets are amortized over our estimate of their period of benefit three to seven years 
contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to class action lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary to assess any contingencies 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters

certain factors you should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this form k before you make any investment decisions with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks the company faces 
interland has incurred operating losses since inception  and it expects to incur losses for at least the next three quarters 
the company has incurred net losses and losses from operations for all but one of each quarterly period from inception through fiscal interland does not expect to generate positive cash flow from continuing operations until the fourth quarter of fiscal in some cases operating expenses will increase as a result of adapting network infrastructure to accommodate additional customers  increasing sales and marketing efforts  broadening customer support capabilities  integrating recently acquired businesses  and expanding administrative resources in anticipation of future growth 
to the extent that increases in expenses are not offset by increases in revenues  the company s operating losses will increase 
because interland s historical financial information is not representative of its future results  investors and analysts will have difficulty analyzing interland s future earnings potential 
since the company has sold its non hosting businesses  its historical financial information  contained in previous filings with the securities and exchange commission  will not be representative of its future operating results 
excluding the operations of the non hosting businesses which are classified as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements non web hosting revenues represented approximately and of the company s total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
furthermore  the company s financial results for fiscal reflect the partial impacts of three company and three account acquisitions completed during the year 
in addition  the company s financial results for fiscal only reflect the integration of interland georgia for days 
by contrast web hosting revenues constituted of the company s total revenues in fiscal interland has a limited operating history and its business model is still evolving  which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
the company s limited operating history makes evaluating its business operations and prospects difficult 
the company s range of service offerings has changed since its inception and its business model is still new and developing 
specifically  the company business has changed from being primarily a seller of personal computers and related accessories to being exclusively a web hosting company 
as a result  the revenues and income potential of the company s business  as well as the potential benefits of acquisitions and integrations will be difficult to evaluate 
interland s quarterly operating results will fluctuate and its future revenues and profitability are not certain 
the company s past operating results have been subject to fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis 
interland may also experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to a wide variety of factors 
because of these fluctuations  comparisons of operating results from period to period are not meaningful 
table of contents and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
factors that cause operating results to fluctuate include  but are not limited to demand for and market acceptance of the company s services  introductions of new services or enhancements by interland and its competitors  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the internet generally or the company s hosting operations specifically  customer retention  increased competition and consolidation within the web hosting and applications hosting markets  changes in the company s pricing policies and the pricing policies of its competitors  gains or losses of key strategic relationships 
the company cannot provide assurances as to the extent to which it will be successful in achieving plans to increase the size of its customer base  the amount of services it offers or the amount of the increase in revenues it will experience during the next fiscal year  or beyond 
in addition  relatively large portions of interland s expenses are fixed in the short term  and therefore its results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
also  if the company were unable to continue using third party products in its service offerings  its service development costs would increase significantly 
in addition  the terrorist acts of september  have contributed to an uncertain economic environment and the company cannot predict the impact of these events  any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action  on its customers or business 
the company believes that  in light of these events  some businesses may curtail spending on information technology  which could also affect its quarterly results in the future 
interland s stock price will be volatile which could cause your investment in the company s common stock to decrease significantly 
the market price of the company s common stock has experienced a significant volatility during the last fiscal year 
the price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to several factors  such as company s failure to experience the benefits of merger and acquisitions as quickly as anticipated  or at all in the way the financial analysts expected  variations in actual and anticipated operating results  variations in actual and anticipated operating results of customers or competitors  the volatility of stock within the sectors within which the company conducts business  general decline in economic conditions  and reductions in the volume of trading in the company s common stock 
during the week period ended november   the high and low closing price for the company s common stock was and respectively 
interland operates in a new and evolving market 
the market for web hosting and applications hosting services for small and medium sized businesses is new and evolving rapidly 
the company s future growth  if any  will depend upon the willingness of small and medium sized businesses to outsource web and applications hosting services  the company s ability to increase its average revenues per customer  and its ability to retain customers 
for the year ended august  the company s average monthly revenue per customer account was and our average monthly customer turnover rate was  as compared to and for the year ended august  the market for interland s services may not develop further  consumers may not widely adopt its services and significant numbers of businesses or organizations may not use the internet for commerce and communication 
if this market fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  or if the company s services do not achieve broader market acceptance  the company will not be able to grow its customer base 
in addition  the company must be able to differentiate itself from its competition through its service offerings and brand recognition 
these activities may be more expensive than the company anticipates  and it may not be successful in differentiating itself  achieving market acceptance of its services or selling additional services to its existing customer base 

table of contents because interland s target markets are volatile  the company may face a loss of customers or a high level of non collectible accounts 
the company intends to concentrate on serving small and medium sized businesses smb 
the smb market contains many businesses that will not be successful  and are consequently they present a substantially greater risk for non collectible accounts receivable  and for non renewal 
moreover  a significant portion of this target market is highly sensitive to price  and may be lost to a low cost competitor 
because few businesses in this target market employ trained technologists  they tend to generate a high number of customer service and technical support calls 
the expense of responding to these calls is considerable  and the expense is likely to increase in direct proportion to revenue  potentially limiting the scalability of the business 
additionally  if the customer becomes dissatisfied with the company s response to such calls  cancellation  non payment  or non renewal becomes more likely 
interland s strategy for minimizing the negative aspects of its target market include continued expenditure on sales and marketing to replace failing customers  capitalizing on planned efficiencies to become a profitable provider at the lowest sustainable price  automating customer care and technical support to reduce the cost per call  and to minimize the time spent by company personnel  intensive training and supervision of customer care and technical support personnel to maximize customer satisfaction 
the company can give no assurance  however  that any of these measures will be successful  and the company s failure to manage these risks will decrease revenues and profitability 
if the company does not successfully integrate the operations and personnel of its recent acquisitions in a timely manner  business will be disrupted and operating results will be negatively affected 
the company s acquisitions involve risks related to the integration and management of these companies operations and personnel 
integration will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt the company s business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
the company must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and telecommunications systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
the company may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating the operations of all affiliated companies  including potential incompatibility of business cultures  potential conflicts in marketing or other important relationships  potential operating inefficiencies and increased costs associated with having and integrating different information and telecommunications systems  potential decline in the level of customer service and customer satisfaction  and the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 
the benefits of the acquisitions of interland georgia  communitech 
net  dialtone  and innerhost may be less than expected and the costs associated with these acquisitions could be higher than expected  which could harm the company s financial results and cause a decline in the value of its common stock 
the company expects to realize cost reductions due to synergies created by recent acquisitions in areas such as integration and expansion of nationwide technical support capabilities over a larger customer base  integration of information and telecommunications systems  marketing the larger combined business  elimination of excess data center capacity and economies of scale for the combined company s telecommunications costs 
through august   as part of the integration with interland georgia  the company has reduced positions from its total headcount  reduced the number of facilities by three  and  incurred approximately million of merger and integration costs 
although the company expects that it will realize cost synergies  it cannot guarantee that it will realize these cost synergies or firmly state the amount of any specific cost synergies 
the company expects to incur costs 
table of contents associated with the consolidation and integration of the companies services and operations 
if the total costs of consolidation and integration activities exceed estimates  or if the cost synergies are less than expected  the company s revenues and profitability would suffer 
any shortfall in anticipated operating results could cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline 
in addition  the market price of interland s common stock will decline significantly if it does not experience the business benefits of the acquisitions and accompanying synergies as quickly or in as great amounts as security analysts expect 
the company has incurred significant accounting charges relating to its recent acquisitions of interland georgia  communitech 
net  dialtone  and innerhost which will delay projected achievement of profitability for the web hosting business 
the company has accounted for all company acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
under this accounting method the purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the following acquisitions have been recorded interland georgia based upon the purchase price of million  the company has recorded million of intangible assets and million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which resulted in annual amortization expense of the intangible assets of million in fiscal communitech 
net based on a purchase price of million  the company has recorded million of intangible assets and million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which resulted in annual amortization expense of intangible assets of million in fiscal dialtone based on a purchase price of million  the company has recorded million of intangible assets and million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which resulted in annual amortization expense of intangible assets of million in fiscal innerhost based on the purchase price of million  the company has recorded million of intangible assets  which resulted in annual amortization expense of intangible assets of million in fiscal the purchase price allocation for innerhost is preliminary pending the completion of the related valuation analysis that will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal as such  there has not yet been an allocation of the purchase price to goodwill 
goodwill will be evaluated annually for impairment and any potential impairment will affect the company s financial results in the future 
if the company acquires additional companies  customer accounts or technologies  it may record additional goodwill and intangible assets  and may face difficulties in integrating those acquisitions 
as part of its strategy to grow the web hosting business  the company has made a number of acquisitions and investments  and it may continue to pursue acquisitions of businesses or assets that it believes are complementary to its business 
the company will be required to record material goodwill and other intangible assets in the likely event the purchase price of the acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in the past  this has resulted in significant amortization charges  and these charges may increase in future periods as the company continues its acquisition strategy 
the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings anticipated to be achieved 
if the company acquires another company  it will likely raise the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to its recent acquisitions 
for example  the company may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and customer accounts into its business 
furthermore  the company may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
as a result  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
interland could incur liabilities in the future relating to its pc systems business  which could cause additional operating losses 
the company could incur liabilities arising from the sale of the pc systems business to gtg pc 
according to the terms of the agreement with gtg pc  the company agreed to retain liabilities relating to the operation of the pc systems business arising prior to the closing of the transaction  including liabilities for taxes  contingent liabilities and liabilities for accounts payable accrued prior to the closing 
the company also agreed to indemnify gtg pc and its affiliates for any breach of the company s representations and warranties contained in the agreement for a period of two years  or for the applicable statute of limitations for matters related to taxes 
this indemnification obligation is capped at million 
except for claims for fraud or injunctive relief  this indemnity is the exclusive remedy for any breach of the company s representations  warranties and covenants contained in the agreement with gtg pc 
accordingly  in the future  interland could be required to make payments to gtg pc and its affiliates in accordance with the agreement in which it sold the pc systems business  which could adversely affect its future results of operations 

table of contents interland could incur additional losses related to its restructuring 
the company may incur additional losses if the company underestimated the costs associated with its restructuring 
in connection with the acquisition of interland georgia in august  the company adopted a restructuring plan to close several offices and data centers  discontinue the use and development of software and eliminate other redundant assets 
as a result  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charge included million related to the closure of offices and data centers  the write off of million of goodwill and intangible assets relating to prior acquisitions  million for asset write downs  million related to personnel termination costs and million related to other costs 
the balance of the restructuring reserve at august  after payments and write downs was million 
the balance of the restructuring reserve at august  is million and reflects reductions of million for payments made  million related to the settlement of data connectivity contract obligations  and an increase of million to reflect the net impact of revised facility exit plans and lease termination settlements recorded during fiscal the company accrued liabilities  which the company believes are adequate to cover all of the costs associated with the restructuring 
however  if the estimates are inadequate  the company will have to record additional restructuring charges interland may be required to pay sales and use taxes related to its discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  the company began to collect and remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states  although its mail order subsidiary briefly ceased collecting such taxes in several states  during portions of and the company is a party to agreements with nearly all states  which generally limit its liability  if any  for non remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements effective dates 
the company has previously accrued a liability for the estimated settlement cost of issues related to sales and use taxes not covered by such agreements 
management believes the resolution of any matters relating to the non remittance of sales or use taxes will not materially affect the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
this potential liability will remain with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
interland may not effectively execute its web hosting strategy and  as a result  others may seize the market opportunity that it has identified 
if interland fails to execute its web hosting strategy in a timely or effective manner  its competitors will be able to seize the opportunity the company had identified to address the web hosting needs of small and medium sized businesses 
interland s business strategy is complex and requires that it successfully and simultaneously complete many tasks  and the failure to complete any one of these following tasks may jeopardize its strategy as a whole 
market its services and build its brand name effectively  develop new products and services  continue to enhance the efficiency of its infrastructure to accommodate additional customers  continue to expand its customer base  continue to respond to competitive developments  influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
because interland faces intense competition  it may not be able to operate profitably in its markets 
the web hosting and applications hosting markets are highly competitive and are becoming more so  which could hinder our ability to successfully market our products and services 
the company may not have the resources  expertise or other competitive factors to compete successfully in the future 
because there are few substantial barriers to entry  and the company expects that it will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
many of interland s competitors have greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry and greater resources 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company can 

table of contents current and potential competitors in the market include web hosting service providers  applications hosting providers  internet service providers  telecommunications companies  large information technology firms that provide a wide array of information technology services and computer hardware suppliers 
these competitors may operate in one or more of these areas and include companies such as affinity  xo communications and verio 
interland s ability to successfully market its services could be substantially impaired if it is unable to deploy new internet applications or if new internet applications it deploys prove to be unreliable  defective or incompatible 
the company cannot provide assurances that it will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new internet application services in the future 
if any newly introduced internet applications suffer from reliability  quality or compatibility problems  market acceptance of interland s services will be hindered and its ability to attract new customers will be adversely affected 
the company cannot assure that new applications it deploys will be free from any reliability  quality or compatibility problems 
if the company incurs increased costs or is unable  for technical or other reasons  to host and manage new internet applications or enhancements of existing applications  its ability to successfully market its services will be impaired 
in addition  the company cannot provide assurances that its customers will accept new services or applications 
impairment of interland s intellectual property rights could negatively affect its business or could allow competitors to minimize any advantage that interland s proprietary technology may give it 
the company currently has no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering the web hosting market that it serves 
while the company has filed  and may file patent applications on particular aspects of its technology  it cannot be sure that it will receive any patents 
while it is the company s practice to enter into agreements with all employees and with some of its customers and suppliers to prohibit or restrict the disclosure of proprietary information  the company cannot be sure that these contractual arrangements or the other steps it takes to protect its proprietary rights will prove sufficient to prevent illegal use of its proprietary rights or to deter independent  third party development of similar proprietary assets 
effective copyright  trademark  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products and services are offered 
the company is currently  and may in the future  be involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
in addition  adverse decisions will subject the company to liabilities  require it to seek licenses from others  prevent it from using  licensing or selling certain of its products and services  or cause disruptions to its operations or the markets in which it competes  which will decrease profitability 
periodically  the company is made aware of claims  or potential claims  that technology it uses may infringe on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of certain asserted and unasserted claims for alleged infringement relating to its discontinued operations prior to the balance sheet date 
resolution of these claims could be costly and decrease profitability 
interland could face unanticipated losses from litigation 
interland is defending an employee class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for idaho 
in this case five individual plaintiffs claim they were employees of micron electronics between and april the plaintiffs claim that they  and other similarly situated employees  did not receive overtime pay to which they were entitled under the fair labor standards act 
interland disputes these claims and believes the plaintiffs are not entitled to any material additional wages 
the court conditionally certified a class of not more than former employees and notices of the litigation are being sent to these persons to give them the opportunity to opt in to the litigation 
the parties are continuing to conduct discovery 
at this early stage of the litigation interland is unable to estimate its total expenses  possible loss or range of loss that may 
table of contents ultimately be connected with the matter 
this potential liability remains with interland even though it sold the pc systems business 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology it used in its discontinued operations may have infringed on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company has evaluated all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  sought to obtain licenses for the use of such technology 
if the company or its suppliers were unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in its discontinued operation s products or processes  it may be forced to defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the company evaluates all such claims and has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the respective dates of the balance sheets included in this report 
resolution of these claims could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and cash flows 
if interland is unable to attract and retain key personnel  it may not be able to compete effectively in its market 
the future success of interland will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
the company experiences strong competition for such personnel in the web hosting industry 
the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  and information technology  engineering and technical support resources could adversely affect its ability to remain competitive in its markets 
the company may face the loss of key personnel which could limit the ability of the company to develop and market its products and services 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient telecommunications network capacity at reasonable costs  it will not be able to provide services at prices acceptable to its customers  thereby reducing demand for its services 
the success of interland will depend upon the capacity  reliability and security of its network infrastructure  including the capacity leased from its telecommunications network suppliers 
interland s network currently delivers service through cable wireless  mcleod  qwest  electric lightwave  genuity  worldcom  level  xo  sprint and touch america 
some of these suppliers are also competitors 
the company s operating results depend  in part  upon the pricing and availability of telecommunications network capacity from a limited number of providers 
if capacity is not available as the company s customers usage increases  the company s network will not be able to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission capacity  reliability or performance 
in addition  the company s business would suffer if its network suppliers increased the prices for their services and it were unable to pass along any increased costs to its customers 
any failure on the part of the company or the part of its third party suppliers to achieve or maintain high data transmission capacity  reliability or performance could significantly reduce the company s ability to handle the expected increase on customer demand for its services  damage its business reputation and increase its costs 
interland depends on its reseller sales channel to market and sell many of its services 
interland does not control its resellers  and if it fails to develop or maintain good relations with resellers  it may not achieve the growth in customers and revenues that it expects 
an element of the strategy for the company s growth is to further develop the use of third parties that resell its services 
many of these resellers are web development or web consulting companies that also sell interland s web hosting services  but that generally do not have established customer bases to which they can market these services 
the company is not currently dependent on any one reseller to generate a significant level of business  but it has benefited from business generated by the reseller channel 
although interland attempts to provide its resellers with incentives such as price discounts on its services that the resellers seek to resell at a profit  the failure of its services to be commercially accepted in some markets  whether as a result of a reseller s performance or otherwise  could cause its current resellers to discontinue their relationships with us 
changes in technology and industry standards may cause interland s products to be non competitive or increase its product costs 
in the web and applications hosting industry  service providers must keep pace with evolving technologies in order to offer relevant  sophisticated services on a timely basis to meet rapidly changing customer demands 
the future success of interland will depend  in part  upon its ability to offer services that incorporate leading technologies  address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of its current and prospective web and applications hosting customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the market for web hosting services is characterized by rapidly changing and unproven technologies  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition and frequent introductions of new services 
to be successful  the company must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its services  including its proprietary technologies  and modify its business strategies accordingly 
interland could also incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
technological advances 
table of contents may have the effect of encouraging some of the company s current or future customers to rely on in house personnel and equipment to furnish the services that it currently provides 
if the company is unable to maintain the compatibility of its services with products offered by its vendors  it will lose or fail to attract customers 
interland believes that its ability to compete successfully also depends upon the continued compatibility of its services with products offered by various vendors 
enhanced or newly developed third party products may not be compatible with its infrastructure  and these products may not adequately address the needs of its customers 
although interland currently intends to support emerging standards  industry standards may not be established  and  even if they are established  the company may not be able to conform to these new standards in a timely fashion in order to maintain a competitive position in the market 
the company s failure to conform to the prevailing standard  or the failure of a common standard to emerge  will cause it to lose customers or fail to attract new customers 
in addition  products  services or technologies developed by others could render the company s services noncompetitive or obsolete 
interland s ability to attract customers is dependent on the reliable performance and growth of use of the internet 
use of the internet for retrieving  sharing and transferring information among businesses  consumers  suppliers and partners has recently begun to increase rapidly 
the adoption of the internet for information retrieval and exchange  commerce and communication  particularly by those enterprises that have historically relied upon alternative means of information gathering  commerce and communications generally requires the adoption of a new medium of conducting business and exchanging information 
if the internet as a commercial or business medium fails to develop further or develops more slowly than expected  the company will not be able to grow its customer base as quickly as desired and its customers would be less likely to require more complex  higher services from it 
interland is vulnerable to system failures  which could harm its reputation  cause its customers to seek reimbursement for services and cause its customers to seek another provider for services 
the company must be able to operate the systems that manage its network around the clock without interruption 
its operations will depend upon its ability to protect its network infrastructure  equipment and customer files against damage from human error  fire  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
although the company has attempted to build redundancy into its networks  its networks are currently subject to various points of failure 
for example  a problem with one of its routers devices that move information from one computer network to another or switches could cause an interruption in the services the company provides to a portion of its customers 
in the past  the company has experienced periodic interruptions in service 
in addition  failure of any of its telecommunications providers to provide the data communications capacity that the company requires  as a result of human error  a natural disaster or other operational disruption  could result in interruptions in services 
any future interruptions could cause customers or end users to seek damages for losses incurred  require the company to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities  damage the company s reputation for reliable service  cause existing customers to cancel their contracts  or make it more difficult for the company to attract new customers 
interland s data centers and networks may be vulnerable to security breaches 
a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the need for secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
some of the company s services rely on security technology licensed from third parties that provides the encryption and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of confidential information 
despite the design and implementation of a variety of network security measures by the company  unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional actions and other disruptions could occur 
in the past  the company has experienced  and in the future it may experience  delays or interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees or others 
in addition  inappropriate use of the network by third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information  such as credit card and bank account numbers stored in the company s computer systems 
these security problems could result in the company s liability and could also cause the loss of existing customers and potential customers 
in addition  third parties could interfere with the operation of customers web sites through intentional attacks including causing an overload of traffic to these web sites 

table of contents although the company continues to implement industry standard security measures  third parties may be able to overcome any measures that it implements 
the costs required to eliminate computer viruses and alleviate other security problems could be prohibitively expensive and the efforts to address such problems could result in interruptions  delays or cessation of service to customers  and harm the company s reputation and growth 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
disruption of interland s services caused by unknown software defects could harm its business and reputation 
the company s service offerings depend on complex software  including proprietary software tools and software licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the company may not discover software defects that affect its new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although interland has not experienced any material software defects to date  it is possible that defects may occur in the software 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage its reputation or increase its service costs  cause it to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert its development resources 
providing services to customers with critical web sites and web based applications could potentially expose interland to lawsuits for customers lost profits or other damages 
because the company s web hosting and applications hosting services are critical to many of its customers businesses  any significant interruption in those services could result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to its customers as well as negative publicity and additional expenditures for it to correct the problem 
although the standard terms and conditions of the company s customer contracts disclaim liability for any such damages  a customer could still bring a lawsuit against it claiming lost profits or other consequential damages as the result of a service interruption or other web site or application problems that the customer may ascribe to it 
a court might not enforce any limitations on its liability  and the outcome of any lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and legal and policy considerations even if the company believes it would have meritorious defenses to any such claims 
in such cases  it could be liable for substantial damage awards 
such damage awards might exceed its liability insurance by unknown but significant amounts  which would seriously harm its business 
interland could face liability for information distributed through its network 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or distributed through their networks is currently unsettled 
online services companies could be subject to claims under both united states and foreign law for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  violation of securities laws or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials distributed through their networks 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose such liability upon other entities are currently pending against other companies 
in addition  organizations and individuals have sent unsolicited commercial e mails from servers hosted by service providers to massive numbers of people  typically to advertise products or services 
this practice  known as spamming  can lead to complaints against service providers that enable such activities  particularly where recipients view the materials received as offensive 
the company may  in the future  receive letters from recipients of information transmitted by its customers objecting to such transmission 
although the company prohibits its customers by contract from spamming  it cannot provide assurances that its customers will not engage in this practice  which could subject it to claims for damages 
in addition  the company may become subject to proposed legislation that would impose liability for or prohibit the transmission over the internet of some types of information 
other countries may also enact legislation or take action that could impose liability on the company or cause it not to be able to operate in those countries 
the imposition upon the company and other online services of potential liability for information carried on or distributed through its systems could require it to implement measures to reduce its exposure to this liability  which may require it to expend substantial resources  or to discontinue service offerings 
the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals also could affect the growth of internet use 
interland s business operates in an uncertain legal environment  where future government regulation and lawsuits could restrict interland s business or cause unexpected losses 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  laws and regulations with respect to the internet may be adopted at federal  state and local levels  covering issues such as user privacy  freedom of expression  pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with internet communications 
the company cannot fully predict the nature of future legislation and the manner in which government authorities may interpret and enforce 
as a result  interland and its customers could be subject to potential liability under future legislation  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
for example  if legislation were adopted in the 
table of contents us or internationally that makes transacting business over the internet less favorable or otherwise curtails the growth of the internet  the company s business would suffer 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations might decrease the growth of the internet  which in turn could decrease the demand for the company s services or increase the cost of doing business or in some other manner harm its business 
in addition  applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
these laws generally pre date the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not consider or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to laws intended to address these issues could create uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for the company s services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs 
instability in international markets or changes in international regulations could cause interland to lose its ability to collect its international revenue 
the company derived approximately of its revenues from international sales for the year ended august   although the company does not have operations outside the united states 
international business is subject to a number of special risks  including different regulatory requirements  different privacy  censorship and liability standards and regulations  less protective intellectual property laws  different technology standards  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities among countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments and a majority of its debt are at fixed interest rates  and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of august   approximately of the company s liquid investments mature within three months and mature within one year 
as of august   management believes the reported amounts of liquid investments and debt to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate investment securities will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the portfolio has been primarily comprised of commercial paper rated a p  bank certificates rated aa or better  and corporate medium term notes rated aa or better 
at august   the company s investment portfolio included fixed rate securities with an estimated fair value of million
