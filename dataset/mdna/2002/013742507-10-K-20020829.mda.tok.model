item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk and uncertainty this report includes forward looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty including  without limitation  risk of dependence on patents  trademarks  third party suppliers  market acceptance of and demand for the company s products  distribution capabilities and the development of technology and government regulatory approval thereof 
sentences or phrases that use words such as believes  anticipates  hopes  plans  may  can  will  expects and others are often used to flag such forward looking statements but their absence does not necessarily mean a statement is not forward looking 
such statements reflect management s current opinion and are designed to help readers understand management s thinking 
by their very nature  however  such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undo reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to regulatory approval of or control by various governmental agencies such as the food and drug administration  department of agriculture and environmental protection agency in the united states and their equivalents in international markets 
the exercise of control and regulatory authority by these agencies can have a material effect on the company s business directly as it relates to the company s products and indirectly as it may relate to competitors products 
within the animal health and surface disinfectant business segment  all of the company s animal health products are sold through distributors having exclusive or semi exclusive rights to specified geographical territories 
the loss of a distributor can have a material effect on the company s sales  particularly  in the short term until a replacement is found  contracted and trained in the sale of the company s products 
further  the company faces well established competition in each of the markets where its animal health products are sold 
such competition  particularly  competition claiming equivalence to the company s products  can limit the sales potential for alcide s products 
alcide s food safety products participate in a rapidly evolving marketplace which by its nature attracts innovation and competing technologies 
the company s sanova sales are based on performance  price and convenience 
introduction of competitive products better meeting these customer needs can have a material impact on the company s ability to sell and expand the use of its sanova products 
the company s business model for its food safety business involves a capital investment ranging from  to  for each user plant site depending on the size of the operation 
the capital investments are depreciated over a five year life while customer contracts range from one to four years 
if a substantial number of customers elect not to renew their contracts  non productive assets would exist until new customers are found 
however  the company s experience after four years in the food safety business is that all customers have renewed their contracts 
occasionally  the company also incurs installation costs of between  and  to install the sanova equipment components at the customer site and connect the components with plumbing and electrical interfaces to put the system into operation 
the capital investments are depreciated over a five year life 
installation costs are depreciated over the shorter of a five year life or the contract term 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue from sales of sanova food antimicrobials is recognized based on the terms of the company s contracts with individual customers 
for customers using more than  gallons of sanova per month  alcide provides bulk shipments of inventory to the customer and the customer is invoiced at month end with revenue recognized based on the amount of product processed or gallons of sanova used 
all other customers are invoiced and revenue is recognized at the time sanova is shipped to their facilities 
payment in either case is due fifteen to thirty days after billing 
animal health and surface disinfectant sales are recognized at the time of shipment to distributors or to end users 
the company provides a limited warranty to its distributors which limits the company s obligation to replacement of defective product 
such replacements have  for the past several years  been less than 
of net sales 
the distributors have no contractual right to return unsold product 
depreciation and book value of sanova plant assets capital investments for sanova plant assets are depreciated over a five year life  while customer contracts range from one year to four years 
as the sanova food antimicrobial business has been in existence for less than five years  the company has a limited  practical basis on which to assign depreciable life 
management believes  however  based on four years experience  that well maintained assets will be operational beyond five years and  further  that if customers decide not to renew their contracts  the assets can be relocated to new customer sites 
the cost to maintain the assets is charged to operations

this will leave a total of  of class b preferred stock to be redeemed in subsequent fiscal years 
the company currently has no commitments beyond fiscal other than the redemption of class b preferred stock

the fair value of the asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and expensed using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life 
any subsequent changes to the fair value of the liability will be expensed 
management is currently assessing the impact of this statement on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  effective for the company on june  
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of segments of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of segments of a business

retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no

under sfas no 
 long lived assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell

liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring

to have a material impact upon the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is not significantly exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates as its cash and marketable securities of  at may  are in close approximation to its short term borrowings and  therefore  changes in prevailing interest rates paid for borrowing would tend to be offset by changes in interest received for investments 
further  at its present growth rate  the company expects to be in a balanced cash position during fiscal lastly  the company s policy is to invest any excess cash resources in low risk  short term and intermediate term us treasury instruments and bank money market funds to minimize market risks 
the company has no foreign currency exposure 
all of its transactions with international distributors are denominated in us dollars
