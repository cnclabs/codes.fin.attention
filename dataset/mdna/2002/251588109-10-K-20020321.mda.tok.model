this form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  which represent the company s expectations and beliefs 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control  and actual results may differ materially depending on many factors  including  without limitation  the financial condition of our customers  changes in domestic and foreign economic and political conditions  demand for our services  changes in our competitive environment  changes in infrastructure requirements  changes in available financing and or cash flow  fixed price contract risks  bidding errors  unanticipated increase in costs  penalty clauses  united states currency fluctuations versus other currencies  foreign nations exchange controls  restrictions on withdrawal of foreign investments and terrorist acts that directly or indirectly could affect our business 
these and other factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date it is made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date it is made 
it is not possible for management to predict what factors might have an affect on our business in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is an analysis of the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  consistently applied 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  cost to complete construction contracts  assets held for sale  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  business divestitures  pensions and other employee benefit plans or arrangements  environmental matters  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate costs to complete our construction contracts based on experience from similar work in the past 
if the conditions of the work to be performed changes or if the estimated costs are not accurately projected  the gross profit from construction contracts may vary significantly in the future 

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from management s review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
if the customers pay a previous impaired receivable  income will be taken 

we maintain reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
if the actual market demand surpasses the projected levels  certain inventory reserves would be removed and the result of operations would be higher than expected 

we maintain an accrual for deferred compensation agreements with the company s president and certain other employees 
this accrual is based on the life expectancy of these persons 
should the actual longevity vary significantly from the united states insurance norms  the accrual may have to be significantly increased or diminished at that time 

based on written legal opinion  we have not recorded a liability of million for taxes assessed by the government of antigua and barbuda for the years through the government may also assess further taxes for the years prior and subsequent to the assessed tax years 
we are appealing said assessments 
however  if our appeal is not successful  a significant tax liability may have to be recorded 
we do not believe losing the appeal would have an immediate effect on our cash flow  as the government of antigua and barbuda owes us in excess of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have million of un repatriated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries 
we have no intention of bringing these earnings back to the united states  unless we can do so in a tax free manner 
however  should we be forced to repatriate the earnings  we would have to recognize and pay a substantial us federal income tax 
the tax would be approximately percent of the repatriated amount  or potentially million 

we were accounting for the notes receivable from the government of antigua and barbuda under the cost recovery method until april subsequent to a restructuring of the notes  we started to account for the notes using the accrual method 
should the payments from the government diminish or become uncertain  we may have to revert to the cost recovery method or impair the notes 
this could decrease our earnings significantly 
see note to consolidated financial statements 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent decrease reflects a decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by an increase in construction revenue 
our materials revenue decreased percent to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our cement terminals in the caribbean and the sale of our operations in dominica in and to the termination of a cement distribution agreement in march excluding these operations  materials revenue decreased by percent  primarily due to decreased demand for block and concrete in st 
martin and antigua 
we have  during the fourth quarter of  seen significantly diminished demand in our st 
martin and antigua operations 
we believe this is a result of a slowdown in the islands economy due to reduced tourism in those islands in the aftermath of the events of september  however  we have seen continued strengthening demand in the us virgin islands over the last year 
at this time  we cannot predict materials revenue levels in revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity with our dredge in st 
martin  partially offset by lower activity in the us virgin islands and antigua 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was million involving projects  as compared to million involving projects at december  the backlog of the contract in the bahamas at december  was million 
we expect most of the current backlog to be completed during since december  we have not entered into any new significant construction and dredging contracts in the caribbean 
we are actively bidding and negotiating additional projects 
if no significant new construction contracts are finalized in the next few months  the construction division will experience a reduction in revenue in cost of materials cost of materials decreased slightly to percent of materials revenue from percent in the cost decrease was due to the reduction of sales of cement that had a lower margin than the rest of our business 
the cost of materials for the materials division  excluding cement  decreased to percent in as compared to percent in cost of construction cost of construction increased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in increased costs as a percent of revenue were due to lower profitability on some contracts 
our gross margins are also affected by the profitability of each contract and the stage of completion 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense decreased by percent to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due a reduction in labor cost  fees and other taxes 
due to lower profitability  lower volumes and hurricane damages affecting certain assets  management upon its review in and of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense of  was recognized in compared to  in in  goodwill recorded in connection with the purchase of our subsidiary in st 
martin was written down by  due to low profitability 
in addition  in the remaining assets in saba were determined to be impaired due to the closure of its operations  and certain obsolete equipment was also determined to be impaired 
divisional operating income loss operating income was  in compared to a loss of million in our materials division had operating income of  in  compared to a loss of million in this improvement is primarily due to improved profitability in most islands relating primarily to reduced cost of production as well as reduced sg a expenses 
over the last two years we have seen an improvement in the operating earnings of the materials division 
however  there are risks that this trend cannot be sustained and that the division s results may decrease in the near future 
our construction division had operating income of million in compared to million in this is primarily attributable to lower margins on some contracts 
due to possible lower activity in  we may see reduced earnings  however  the remaining backlog is estimated to have reasonable gross profit margins 
other income in  we recognized a gain on the sale of our cement terminals and the concrete business in st 
thomas and the tortola operation  in the aggregate amount of million 
we had gains on sale of other property and equipment of  in compared to  in our interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to a substantial reduction of outstanding debt  utilizing the proceeds of our sales of operations as mentioned above 
our interest income increased to million in compared to million in our interest income increased due to interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda  and to interest received on outstanding accounts and notes receivable 
the minority interest allocation of losses decreased to  in from  in  mainly because the losses in puerto rico cannot be allocated to the joint venture partners as their equity has been exhausted 
income taxes income taxes increased to  in from  in our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net earnings loss our net income was million in compared to a net income of million in this reduction in profitability was primarily attributable to the million profit recognized on the sales of assets in the beginning of year  partially offset by a net interest income increase from million in to million in  and a reduction of our operating loss by million 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent decrease reflects a decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by an increase in construction revenue 
our materials revenue decreased percent to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of the concrete operations on st 
thomas  tortola and dominica 
excluding the sale of these operations  materials revenue increased by percent  primarily due to increased demand for quarry products in st 
martin and puerto rico and increased sales of cement in st 
croix 
revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity with our dredge 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was million involving projects  as compared to million involving projects at december  the backlog of the contract in the bahamas at december  was million 
cost of materials cost of materials decreased slightly to percent of materials revenue in from percent in the cost decrease was due to improved sales volumes and  therefore  better margins on st 
martin and puerto rico  offset to a lesser extent by higher production costs in antigua and lower margin on our cement sales 
cost of construction cost of construction decreased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in decreased costs as a percent of revenue were due to higher profitability on some contracts  especially dredging contracts  and the completion of contracts with very low or negative margins in our gross margins are also affected by the profitability of each contract and the stage of completion 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense decreased by percent to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to the sale of the operations in st 
thomas and tortola and to accruals established in in connection with collective bargaining agreements 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to percent in from percent in in we reduced our provision for litigation by million due to the settlement of two major lawsuits 
due to lower profitability  lower volumes and hurricane damages  management upon its review in and of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense was recognized of  in compared to  in in  goodwill recorded in connection with our purchase of our subsidiary in st 
martin was written down by  due to low profitability 
in addition  the remaining assets in saba were determined to be impaired due to the closure of its operations  and certain obsolete equipment was also determined to be impaired 
in  a significant portion of our quarry assets in saba were written down and idle assets on st 
kitts and st 
croix were also determined to be impaired 
divisional operating loss the operating loss was million in compared to an operating loss of million in our materials division had an operating loss of million in  representing an improvement of  compared to an operating loss of million in this reduction in the loss is primarily due to improved profitability in st 
martin and puerto rico and accruals recorded in in connection with collective bargaining agreements  offset to a lesser extent by higher cement cost and the effect that the sale of our operations in st 
thomas  tortola and dominica had on our operating income in our construction division had operating income of million in compared to an operating loss of  in  an improvement of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to improved margins and a  write down of a note in other income deductions we recognized a gain on the sale of our cement terminals and the concrete business in st 
thomas and the tortola operation  in the aggregate amount of million 
we had gains on sale of other property and equipment of  in compared to  in our interest expense decreased to  in from million in due to a substantial reduction of outstanding debt  utilizing the proceeds of our sales of operations as mentioned above 
our interest income increased to million in compared to  in our interest income increased due to interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda  and to a lesser extent  to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents 
previously we had estimated we would record million for year in interest from these antigua notes  however  due to the fact that the payments received were less than anticipated  the interest recorded was million 
the decrease in payments was due to a delay in the implementation of property taxes 
the minority interest allocation of losses decreased to  in from  in  mainly due to improved result in our operations in puerto rico 
income taxes income taxes increased to  in from  in our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and business tax exemptions and benefits 
net earnings loss our net income was million in compared to a net loss of million in this change in profitability was primarily attributable to the profit recognized on the sales of assets in the beginning of the year  net interest income  and to a lesser extent  reduced operating loss 
liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the construction business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
accounts receivable for the materials division are typically outstanding for days or longer 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
management believes our cash flow from operations  existing working capital  and funds available from lines of credit will be adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december  there were no amounts outstanding to these lenders 
management believes it has significant collateral and financial stability to be able to obtain significant financing  should it be required 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and an available line of credit of million 
total outstanding liabilities were million as of december  compared to million a year earlier 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in receivables of million and an increase in inventory of  the primary source of cash from operating activities was a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million and an increase in taxes payable of  net cash used in investing activities was million in  including purchases of property  plant  and equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million  including purchases of treasury stock of we turned our fiscal year end accounts receivable  excluding notes and employee receivables  approximately times in compared to times in the reduction resulted from a lower turnover rate for the construction division accounts receivable of in as compared to in  mainly due to a million receivable from the project in the bahamas 
this receivable was greatly reduced in january by a cash payment of million 
the materials division showed a small improvement in the turnover rate from to another reason for our total turnover rate reduction is that the materials division  which had a better turnover rate than the construction division  had significantly reduced sales and receivables greatly reduced in  therefore its weight in the composite turnover rate diminished 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have financed some construction projects during the last six months 
included in our receivables are million expected to be paid back within a four year period 
on november   we extended a million note to the venture in the bahamas  secured by equipment and guarantees 
the note has been paid in full 
as of december   we had trade receivables from the venture of approximately million 
subsequent to the year end we have received million in payments and billed an additional million 
we entered into a credit agreement with a caribbean bank in november for a total credit of million 
one part of the credit agreement is a term loan for million  which was fully paid in the second part was a revolving line of credit of million 
we did not seek to renew the credit line in july we have a million unsecured overdraft facility from a commercial bank in the united states 
the facility is due on demand and bears interest at a rate variable with libor 
the bank can demand repayment of the loan and cancellation of the overdraft facility  if certain financial or other covenants are in default 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line 
this facility was put in place to help cash management strategies and is seldom utilized 
at december  we had borrowed million from the company president 
the note to the president is unsecured and bears interest at the prime rate 
presently  million is due on demand and million is due on july  the president has the option to make the note due on demand should a change of control occur 
a change of control has occurred if a person or group acquires percent or more of the common stock or announces a tender offer that  if successful  would result in ownership by a person or group of percent or more of the common stock 
we purchase equipment as needed for our ongoing business operations 
we are currently replacing or upgrading some equipment used by the materials division  principally concrete trucks and quarry equipment 
this resulted in a net cash expenditure of million in at present  management believes that our inventory of construction equipment is adequate for our current contractual commitments and operating activities 
new construction contracts may  depending on the nature of the contract and job location and duration  require us to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
during we sold equipment with an original cost basis of million and a net book value of  the net proceeds consisting of cash and notes receivable were  we realized a gain of approximately  on these transactions 
we believe we have available funds or can obtain sufficient financing for our contemplated equipment replacements and additions 
in september the company decided to stop its operations on aguadilla  puerto rico 
there was no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company has leased  with option to buy  its equipment on this site to a company controlled by one of the joint venture owners of the company s subsidiary in puerto rico 
the lease rate should generate a small income after depreciation and interest on the equipment 
our notes receivable at december  include million in promissory notes from the government of antigua with approximately  classified as a current receivable 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any other person s or company s debt 
we have not entered into any currency or interest options  swaps or future contracts  nor do we have any off balance sheet debts or transactions 
we are sometime involved in litigation  the outcome of such litigation may in the future have an impact on our liquidity 
see item above 
related party transactions we have certain transactions with some of our directors or employees 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we lease from the company president  mr 
donald l 
smith  jr 
a acre parcel of real property in deerfield beach  florida 
this property is being used for our equipment logistics and maintenance activities 
the annual rent for the period through was  which was below market rent 
in january a new year agreement was signed  the rent was increased to  this rent was based on comparable rental contracts for similar properties in deerfield beach 
we have borrowed million from mr 
smith to provide long term financing to the company 
the loan is documented with an unsecured note  of which one million is payable on demand and million is due on july  the interest charged by mr 
smith is the prime rate 
we believe that these terms are similar to what the company would be able to achieve if we were to borrow this money from a bank 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
we have a million construction contract with an entity in the bahamas 
mr 
smith and one of the directors  mr 
robert a 
steele  are minority shareholders in the entity 
mr 
smith is member of the entity s managing committee 
we believe the contract has been entered into at arm s length and at terms and conditions that we would offer our other customers 
prices established for the work are dependant on market conditions and unique conditions to the environment of the bahamas 
in connection with this contract  the company has recorded revenue of million during the backlog on the contract as of december  was million 
the project received its final financing in january as of december  we had trade receivables from the venture of approximately million 
subsequent to year end the company received million in payments from the venture and billed an additional million 
our joint venture subsidiary in puerto rico has transactions with the joint venture partners 
a company controlled by one of the partners provides drilling and blasting services for our quarry in guaynabo 
the price for the services are negotiated periodically  and primarily by comparison to the cost of performing that work by ourselves 
the subsidiary recently entered into a month lease agreement for equipment located in the aguadilla facility with another company controlled by this partner 
the agreement also contains an option to buy the equipment 
the price of the lease and the sales price of the equipment were negotiated between the parties at arm s length 
there are no clear comparable prices in the market place  and no third party evaluation of the fairness of the transaction was completed 
the subsidiary will recuperate its recorded book value of the assets  should the purchase option be exercised 
the same subsidiary sells a significant portion of its products to a company controlled by another joint venture partner 
this partner is controlled by one of our directors  jose a 
bechara  jr 
esq 
the price of the products is governed by firm supply agreements  renegotiated every other year 
comparable prices from other quarries are studied and used in the price negotiation 
other assets include amounts due from officers and employees as a result of payments made by the company pursuant to a split dollar life insurance plan 
our advances to pay premiums are secured by a pledge of the cash value of the issued policies 
amounts due to the company under the split dollar life insurance plan were  in and  in  respectively 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the issuance of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations 
the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are requiring the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requiring that unallocated negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain 
we do not expect a material impact from the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
supersedes apb  intangible assets  and primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition ie  the post acquisition accounting 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
we do not expect a material impact from the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires that entities record as a liability obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset when such obligations are incurred  and capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect a material impact from the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb approved the issuance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets
