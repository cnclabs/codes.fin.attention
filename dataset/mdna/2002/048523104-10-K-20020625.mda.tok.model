because a significant portion of our revenues are derived from services related to deregulation and consolidation activities in the financial services industry  changes in the regulatory environment or a reduction in consolidation activity have in the past  and could in the future  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the loss of a major customer or termination of a major project as a result of an acquisition of a customer by an organization to which the company does not currently provide services  or for any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues and profitability 

table of contents cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits for personnel dedicated to customer assignments  fees paid to subcontractors for work performed in connection with customer assignments  and reimbursable contract related travel and entertainment expenses incurred in connection with the delivery of our services 
customer project margins and personnel utilization percentages are the most significant variables in determining our income from continuing operations 
we manage our personnel utilization rates by monitoring personnel needs and generally adjust personnel levels based on specific project requirements 
the number of staff assigned to particular projects may vary widely depending on the size  duration  and degree of completion and complexity of each engagement 
delays in project completion and in implementation may result in periods when personnel are not assigned to active projects and  accordingly  result in lower average utilization rates during such periods  which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  we must maintain appropriate numbers of senior professionals both to oversee existing engagements and for business development activities 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  travel expenses and promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with our management  finance and administrative groups  including recruiting  training  depreciation and amortization  and occupancy costs 
acquisition disposition of assets on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of cool springs associates  inc d b a earningsinsights ei  including  of fixed assets  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement by and among us  ei and certain stockholders of ei the asset purchase agreement 
the purchase price for the acquisition consisted of a million cash payment and the issuance by us of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we paid the cash portion of the consideration for the acquired assets from our working capital 
on march   we announced our decision to discontinue the operations of ei because its offering had not met expectations and its operations had a negative impact on our earnings 
the disposition of the operations of ei represents the disposal of a business segment under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accordingly  the results of this operation have been classified as discontinued and interim quarterly periods have been restated

quarterly revenues and operating results can depend on the number  size and scope of customer projects commenced and completed during a quarter  changes in employee utilization rates  changes in average billing rates  the number of working days in a quarter  the timing of introduction of new service offerings  both by us and our competitors  changes in pricing  both by us and our competitors  loss of a significant customer  increased competition from our competitors  loss of key personnel  other factors that adversely impact the financial services industry  general economic conditions  potential acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business or technologies into our existing business and operations  and our ability to develop and introduce new service offerings  improve existing service offerings and develop and maintain the skills necessary to keep pace with changing technologies 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle is relatively long  ranging from one to six months for new projects with existing customers and three to six months for new customers  and 
table of contents may depend on factors such as the size and scope of projects or other factors that adversely impact the financial services industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  the relatively long length of our sales cycle may negatively impact the operating results for any particular quarter as a result of increased sales and marketing expenses without associated increases in revenues in the particular quarter 
furthermore  many of our projects are  and may be in the future  terminable without customer penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project or loss of a major customer could require us to maintain or terminate underutilized employees  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned persons or higher than expected severance expenses 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues decreased for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march   to million from million

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing and of revenues  respectively 
the overall dollar decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in our sales and marketing group from an average of employees for fiscal to an average of employees for fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues is due to the significant reduction in revenue from the prior year

interest income  net interest income  net decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to interest rate decreases and lower cash balances 
interest expense is immaterial 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes decreased million to a million tax benefit in fiscal compared to a  provision in fiscal the benefit was a result of the recent passage of the economic stimulus act which allows a company to carry back losses for five years to recover taxes previously paid 
this tax benefit was initiated in q and is net of a provision for taxes in q of 
million which was to establish a valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
management established the valuation allowance because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realizable in the near future 
discontinued operations on march   we announced our decision to discontinue the operations of ei 
consequently  we incurred a charge of million  net of income tax benefit  relating to the write off of ei assets and an accrual for estimated losses during the phase out period 
the disposition of the ei operation represents the disposal of a business segment under apb no 
accordingly  results of this operation have been classified as discontinued  and interim quarterly periods have been restated 
for the fiscal year ended march   ei incurred a  loss  net of income tax benefit 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues decreased for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march   to million from million

interest expense is immaterial 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
our tax rate may vary from period to period based on our expansion into areas with varying state and local statutory income tax rates 
the increase in the effective tax rate percentage  and the fact that the effective rates are so much higher than the statutory rates  is primarily due to permanent differences relating to meals and entertainment expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we have no long term debt and continue to operate primarily debt free 
working capital decreased to million at march  compared to million at march  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to the ei acquisition 
our days sales in accounts receivable at march  was compared to days at march  while we believe that the risk with respect to collection of accounts receivable is minimized by the creditworthiness of our customers  primarily banks and other financial institutions  and our credit and collection policies  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter collection problems in the future 
we attempt to further minimize this risk by performing ongoing credit valuations of our customers and maintaining an allowance for potential credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts and collection policies are adequate 
on september   we made a million preferred stock investment  representing a minority interest  in s systems  inc  a software solution provider in the banking and diversified financial services markets 
during the quarter ended september   we determined that our investment was permanently impaired and it was written down to zero 
on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of cool springs associates  inc d b a ei  including  of fixed assets  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement by and among us  ei and 
table of contents certain stockholders of ei the asset purchase agreement 
the purchase price for the acquisition consisted of a million cash payment and the issuance by us of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we paid the cash portion of the consideration for the acquired assets from our working capital 
on march   we announced our decision to discontinue the operations of ei because its offering had not met expectations and its operations had a negative impact on our earnings 
the disposition of the operations of ei represents the disposal of a business segment under apb no 
accordingly  the results of this operation have been classified as discontinued and interim quarterly periods have been restated 
capital expenditures for continuing operations were approximately  for the fiscal year  exclusive of the aforementioned expenditure for ei fixed assets  and  for fiscal year the expenditures were used primarily for computer and other equipment  software and  to a lesser extent  leasehold improvements 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  and will be used primarily for computers and other equipment 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  together with cash provided from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
we lease our facilities and other equipment under operating leases 
rent expense recognized under these leases during the fiscal years ended march   and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments due under noncancelable operating leases are as follows required minimum payments in thousands year ending march total minimum lease payments there were no capital leases outstanding as of march  new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method which were initiated before but completed after june  sfas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic testing of the goodwill for impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  
table of contents however  early adoption of sfas will be permitted for companies with a fiscal year beginning after march   provided their first quarter financial statements have not been previously issued 
we have early adopted sfas as of april  since we had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the date of adoption there is no effect on prior period financial results 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective january  sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business described in apb no 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following represents our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we derived of our revenue from consulting services under time and material billing arrangements in fiscal year under these arrangements  revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
we also derive revenue on fixed price contracts 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and is adjusted monthly for the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates 
we determine the percentage of completion of our contracts by comparing costs incurred to date to total estimated costs 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
a deferred tax valuation allowance is established if  in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march   a full valuation allowance has been provided for our deferred tax assets 
if we achieve sustained profitability  some or all of this valuation allowance would be reversed to income 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment under sfas and  in fiscal year under sfas  we will perform these evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
indicators of potential impairment include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and a significant adverse change in our business or our industry 
if we believe an indicator of potential impairment exists  we test to determine whether the impairment recognition criteria of sfas and sfas  going forward  have been met 
in evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we make several significant estimates and judgments  including estimating future cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets  and determining an appropriate discount rate to use in the analysis 
use of different estimates and judgments could yield materially different results in our analysis  and could result in significant different asset impairment charges 
marketable securities we invest in marketable securities as part of our strategy to invest excess cash and achieve income therefrom 
on a quarterly basis we review the fair market value of these marketable securities in comparison to historical cost 
if the fair market value of a marketable security is less than our carrying value  we consider all available evidence in assessing when and if the value of the investment can be expected to recover to at least its historical cost 
this evidence would include a lack of any substantial company specific adverse events causing declines in value  and overall financial condition and liquidity of the issuer of the securities 
if our review indicates that the decline in value is other than temporary  we write down our investment to the then current market value and record an impairment charge in our statements of operations 
the determination of whether an unrealized loss is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and can have a material impact on our reported results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates due to investments in instruments made for non trading purposes 
the interest rate risk relates primarily to our portfolio of short term investment grade securities 
as of march  we did not  nor do we intend to  use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars and take place in north america 
we believe that interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risks are both immaterial to the company
