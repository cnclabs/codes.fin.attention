overview we are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of mid sized investment management firms our affiliates 
as of december   our affiliated investment management firms managed approximately billion in assets across a broad range of investment styles and in three principal distribution channels high net worth  mutual fund and institutional 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of existing affiliates  investments in additional  mid sized investment management firms  and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
in our investments in affiliates  we typically hold a majority equity interest in each firm  with the remaining equity interests retained by the management of the affiliate 
each affiliate is organized as a separate and largely autonomous limited liability company or limited partnership 
each affiliate operating agreement is tailored to meet the particular characteristics of the affiliate 
many of our affiliates organizational documents include revenue sharing arrangements 
each such revenue sharing arrangement allocates a percentage of revenue typically for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
we determine the percentage of revenue designated as operating allocation for each affiliate in consultation with senior management of the affiliate at the time of our investment based on the affiliate s historical and projected operating margins 
the organizational document of each such affiliate allocates the remaining portion of the affiliate s revenue typically to the owners of that affiliate including us 
we call this the owners allocation 
each affiliate distributes its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may increase their compensation from the operating allocation  and their distributions from the owners allocation  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation which is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
an affiliate s managers therefore have incentives to increase revenue thereby increasing the operating allocation and their share of the owners allocation and to control expenses thereby increasing the amount of operating allocation available for their compensation 
the revenue sharing arrangements allow us to participate in the revenue growth of each affiliate because we receive a portion of the additional revenue as our share of the owners allocation 
we participate in that growth to a lesser extent than the affiliate s managers  however  because we do not share in the growth of the operating allocation or in any increases in profit margin 
in certain other cases such as  for example  the managers funds llc managers  the affiliate is not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement  but instead operates on a profit based model 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
net income on our income statement reflects the consolidation of substantially all of the revenue of our affiliates  reduced by the operating expenses of our affiliates which generally are limited to their operating allocations  our operating expenses ie  our holding company expenses  including interest  amortization and income taxes  and the profits owned by our affiliates managers representing their share of the owners allocation and referred to on our income statement as minority interest 
as discussed above  the operating expenses of an affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  a variety of factors affecting the securities markets generally  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the receipt of owners allocation  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
we generally derive our revenue from the provision of investment management services for fees by our affiliates 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management 
certain of the affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other affiliates bill advisory fees for all or a portion of their clients based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears  while mutual fund clients are billed based upon daily assets 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  fees paid on the basis of investment performance performance fees at certain affiliates may affect the profitability of those affiliates and us 
performance fees are inherently dependent on investment results  and therefore may vary substantially from year to year 
for example  performance fees were of an unusual magnitude in  but were not as significant in or  and may not recur even to the same magnitude as in or in future years  if at all 
our profit distributions generally take priority over the distributions to other owners 
if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of an affiliate  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers  until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of future owners allocation 
we believe it is significant to distinguish certain amortization and other non cash expenses from other operating expenses since these expenses do not require the use of cash 
we have provided additional supplemental information in this report for cash related earnings as an addition to  but not as a substitute for  measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  and our calculations may not be consistent with those of other companies 
in this report  our additional measures of cash related earnings are cash net income net income plus depreciation and amortization  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of funds available to us which may be used to make new investments  repay debt obligations  repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock although we have no current plans to pay dividends  ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements  and ebitda contribution ebitda plus our holding company operating expenses  which we believe is useful to investors as an indicator of funds available from our affiliates operations to pay holding company operating expenses  service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
beginning in  our measure of cash net income will be modified in response to the implementation of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
prior to this change  deferred tax expenses were accrued because intangible assets were amortized over different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes since we structure our investments as taxable transactions  and since our cash taxes are reduced by amortization deductions over the periods prescribed by tax laws 
while fas eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets  it continues to require the accrual of deferred tax expenses for these assets 
nevertheless  because under fas this deferred tax accrual would reverse only in the event of a future sale or impairment of an affiliate  we believe deferred tax accruals should be added back in calculating cash net income to best approximate the actual funds available to us to make new investments  repay debt obligations or repurchase shares of common stock 
accordingly  in providing future supplemental information  we will define cash net income as net income plus depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes 
results of operations we conduct our business in three operating segments corresponding with the three principal distribution channels in which our affiliates provide investment management services high net worth  mutual fund and institutional 
clients in the high net worth distribution channel include wealthy individuals and family trusts  with whom our affiliates have direct relationships or indirect relationships through managed account wrap programs 
in the mutual fund distribution channel  our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to mutual funds that are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisers  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 
in the institutional distribution channel  our affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities and taft hartley plans 
our assets under management include assets which are directly managed and those that underlie overlay strategies 
overlay assets assets managed subject to strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities generate fees which typically are substantially lower than the fees generated by our affiliates other investment strategies 
therefore  changes in directly managed assets have a greater impact on our revenue than changes in total assets under management a figure which includes overlay assets 
the following tables present a summary of our reported assets under management by distribution channel and activity

in millions  except as noted change change average assets under management in billions high net worth mutual fund institutional total revenue high net worth mutual fund institutional total net income high net worth mutual fund institutional total ebitda high net worth mutual fund institutional total revenue our revenue is generally determined by the following factors the increase or decrease in assets under management from new investments  net client cash flows or changes in the value of assets that are attributable to fluctuations in the equity markets  the portion of our directly managed and overlay assets  which realize different fee rates  the portion of our assets across the three principal distribution channels and our affiliates  which realize different fee rates  and the recognition of any performance fees charged by certain affiliates 
in addition  the billing patterns of our affiliates will have an impact on revenue in cases of rising or falling markets 
as described previously  advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period  while advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
average assets under management for the high net worth and institutional distribution channels represents an average of the assets under management at the end of each calendar quarter 
average assets under management for the mutual fund distribution channel represents an average of daily net assets for the year 
net income by distribution channel reflects revenue for assets managed in each distribution channel after our allocation of consolidated operating expenses  including the growth in profit margins beyond our contractual owners allocation paid to affiliate management partners as compensation from the operating allocation 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of our distribution channel operating results 
total revenue decreased in from  following a decrease in from the decrease in revenue in resulted primarily from declines in directly managed assets attributable to declines in the value of assets under management  which resulted principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
these declines were partially offset by revenue generated by positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets and from investments in new affiliates 
the decrease in revenue in was principally the result of an unusual magnitude of performance fees realized in  which accounted for of revenue in and which did not recur at this level in the decrease in revenue in was partially offset by the growth in asset based fees at our existing affiliates and from our investment in frontier capital management company  llc frontier  which closed in january a discussion of the changes in our revenue by operating segments follows high net worth distribution channel the decrease in revenue in from resulted from a decline in performance fees and a shift in assets under management within this distribution channel to client relationships that realize lower fee rates  and was partially offset by the increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of from to was primarily attributable to positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets and our investment in welch forbes llc welch forbes in november  and was partially offset by a decline in the value of assets under management attributable to equity market performance 
the decrease in revenue in resulted principally from a decrease in performance fees  and was partially offset by an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of from to was primarily attributable to positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets and the increase in the value of assets under management attributable to equity market performance 
mutual fund distribution channel the increase in revenue in resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of from to was primarily attributable to positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets and our investment in friess associates  llc friess in october  and was partially offset by a decline in the value of assets under management attributable to equity market performance 
the increase in revenue in was principally the result of an increase in average assets under management  which increased from to as a result of positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets  and the increase in the value of assets under management attributable to equity market performance 
institutional distribution channel the decrease in revenue in resulted from the decrease in average assets under management  and in particular from the decrease in our directly managed assets 
the decrease in average assets under management of from to was primarily attributable to net client cash outflows from directly managed and overlay assets  as well as a decline in the value of assets under management attributable to equity market performance 
the decrease in revenue in resulted principally from a significant decrease in performance fees  and was partially offset by an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of in from was primarily attributable to our new investment in frontier in january operating expenses the following table presents a summary of our consolidated operating expenses our holding company expenses and our affiliates operating allocations 
dollars in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses because substantially all of these expenses excluding intangible amortization are incurred by our affiliates and because affiliate expenses are generally limited to an operating allocation  our total operating expenses are impacted by increases or decreases in an affiliate s revenue which correspondingly increase or decrease that affiliate s operating allocation 
total operating expenses excluding intangible amortization decreased from to  following a decrease from to  reflecting the general relationship between revenue and the operating allocations for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
compensation and related expenses decreased in and in  primarily as a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from to and from to the increase in was attributable to increases in spending by our affiliates from their operating allocations and an increase in aggregate affiliate expenses resulting from our investments in friess and welch forbes 
the increase in principally resulted from the growth in mutual fund distribution expenses as a result of the acquisition of managers in and the subsequent growth in managers revenue and related distribution expenses 
the increases in amortization of intangible assets of and in and  respectively  resulted from our investments in new affiliates and our purchase of additional interests in existing affiliates 
the increase in amortization expenses in is less than the increase in because of the timing of new investments and changes in accounting rules 
the frontier investment was completed in january  while the friess and welch forbes investments were completed in october and november  respectively 
in addition  in accordance with new accounting rules  we did not amortize the goodwill acquired in our investments 
other income statement data the following table summarizes other income statement data 
dollars in millions change change minority interest income tax expense interest expense investment and other income minority interest decreased from to  following a decrease from to the decrease in resulted from the decline in revenue  and was partially offset by the growth in revenue at affiliates in which we own relatively lower percentages of owners allocation 
the decrease in was attributable to the significant level of performance fees earned in and resultant higher levels of owners allocation accruing to affiliate managers that did not recur to the same extent in in percentage terms  the decrease in minority interest in was greater than the decrease in revenue in because of the revenue growth at managers  which has no related minority interest expense since we own substantially all of the firm 
the decrease in income taxes from to was attributable to the decrease in income before taxes  and to a decrease in our effective tax rate from to 
our effective tax rate  which decreased from to in  continued to decrease in as a result of a reduction in state taxes which resulted from the addition of affiliates in lower tax rate jurisdictions and our implementation of an incentive compensation plan  which limited non deductible expenses 
interest expense decreased in and increased in the decrease in interest expense in resulted from the restructuring of our long term debt to effect lower costs of borrowing and a decrease in the effective interest rate of our senior revolving credit facility 
in may  we completed the private placement of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes accreting at a rate of per year  and used million of the net proceeds of approximately million to repay debt under our credit facility 
the decrease in the effective interest rate of our senior revolving credit facility was the result of a decrease in libor rates 
the decrease in interest expense in was partially offset by million of amortization of debt issuance costs on the zero coupon notes and expenses of million related to our transition to the new derivative accounting rules 
in december  we completed the sale of mandatory convertible securities in which we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  the sale of over allotment units increased the total net proceeds from this offering to million 
interest expense in was not materially affected by this transaction because it occurred in the final month of the year 
the increase in interest expense in was the result of an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding under our credit facility and increases in libor interest rates 
the increase in weighted average debt outstanding was attributable to our investment in frontier and our repurchase of shares of our common stock  and was partially offset by debt repayments from cash flows from operations 
the increase in investment and other income from to was attributable to the investment of proceeds realized from the sale of convertible notes described above 
the decrease in investment and other income from to was primarily related to the significant levels of income recognized from affiliates interests in investment partnerships in that did not occur to the same degree in net income and other financial data the following table summarizes historical levels of net income and other supplemental measures concerning cash related earnings presented as an addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income 
dollars in millions change change net income ebitda contribution ebitda cash net income the and decreases in net income in and  respectively  resulted principally from the changes in the ebitda contribution of our affiliates and  in  from an increase in interest expense and amortization expense as discussed previously  which did not recur in the and decreases in ebitda contribution and ebitda were principally attributable to the factors that affected our revenue in these years  as discussed previously 
cash net income decreased and in and  respectively  primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income  excluding the changes in depreciation and amortization during these periods 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of december in the years indicated below dollars in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt zero coupon convertible debt mandatory convertible debt cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows we have met our cash requirements primarily through borrowings from our banks  cash generated by operating activities and the issuance of equity and convertible debt securities 
our principal uses of cash have been to make investments  repay indebtedness  pay income taxes  repurchase shares  make additional investments in existing affiliates including our purchase of affiliate managers retained equity  support our and our affiliates operating activities and for working capital purposes 
we expect that our principal uses of funds for the foreseeable future will be for additional investments  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of interest on outstanding debt  payment of income taxes  capital expenditures  additional investments in existing affiliates including our purchase of affiliate managers retained equity and for working capital purposes 
under our senior revolving credit facility  we had outstanding borrowings of million and million of additional capacity as of december  while we have the option  with the consent of our lenders  to increase the facility by another million to a total of million  the pending maturity of our credit facility will likely limit our potential to exercise that option 
our borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by pledges of all of our interests in our affiliates including all interests which are directly held by us  as well as all interests which are indirectly held by us through wholly owned subsidiaries  which interests represent substantially all of our assets 
in addition  our credit facility contains provisions for the benefit of our lenders that restrict the manner in which we can conduct our business  that may adversely affect our ability to make investments in new and existing affiliates and that may have an adverse impact on the interests of our stockholders 
our credit facility bears interest at either libor plus a margin or the prime rate plus a margin 
in order to partially offset our exposure to changing interest rates  we have entered into interest rate hedging contracts  as discussed below in market risk 
the credit facility matures in december  and we intend to obtain new credit financing prior to that time 
however  we may not be able to obtain this financing on terms comparable to our current credit facility 
our failure to do so could increase our interest expense  decrease our net income and adversely affect our ability to fund new investments and otherwise use our credit facility as described above 
our obligations to purchase additional equity in our affiliates extend over the next years 
as of december   if all of these obligations became due in their entirety  the aggregate amount of these obligations and other obligations for contingent payments would have been approximately million 
assuming the closing of the additional purchases  we would own the prospective owners allocation of all additional equity so purchased  currently estimated to represent approximately million on an annualized basis 
in order to provide the funds necessary for us to meet such obligations and for us to continue to acquire interests in investment management firms  it may be necessary for us to incur  from time to time  additional debt and or to issue equity or debt securities  depending on market and other conditions 
for example  in we sold million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior notes and million of mandatory convertible securities including an over allotment exercised in january 
we may be required to repurchase some or all of the zero coupon convertible senior notes on various dates commencing may  these potential obligations  combined with our other cash needs  may require more cash than is available from operations 
thus  we may need to raise capital by making additional borrowings or by selling shares of our stock or other equity or debt securities  or to otherwise refinance a portion of these obligations 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing or refinancing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
please see the discussion of our repurchase obligations under the zero coupon convertible senior notes in financing cash flows below 
cash and cash equivalents aggregated million at december   an increase of million from december  excluding balances held by our affiliates  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at december  operating cash flows the decrease in net cash flow from operating activities from to and the increase from to resulted principally from operating cash flows received in from performance fees earned in the fourth quarter of  which did not occur to the same degree in either or investing cash flows year to year changes in net cash flow from investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments was million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in october  we completed our million investment in friess  which we funded through borrowings under our senior credit facility and working capital 
in  we also completed new investments in welch forbes  bowling portfolio management  dublin fund distributors and additional investments in existing affiliates 
these investments were funded through borrowings under our credit facility  working capital  notes issued to affiliate managers and issuances of our common stock 
financing cash flows the increase in net cash flow from financing activities from to was attributable to the sale of convertible debt securities  further described below 
the decrease in net cash flow from financing activities from to was attributable to our follow on offering of shares of our common stock and our repurchases of shares of our common stock in pursuant to our stock repurchase program  further described below 
the principal sources of cash from financing activities over the last three years have been issuances of convertible debt securities  borrowings under our senior credit facility and our public offering of shares of common stock 
our uses of cash from financing activities during this period were for the repayment of debt and for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
in may  we completed the private placement of zero coupon senior convertible notes in which we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to repay debt under our senior revolving credit facility  and the balance was used for other general corporate purposes 
in this private placement  we sold a total of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes due  with each  note issued at of such principal amount and accreting at a rate of per annum 
each security is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events i if for certain six calendar month periods  the closing sale prices of our common stock are more than a specified price initially and increasing incrementally each six calendar month period for the next years to on april   ii if the credit rating assigned to the securities is below a specified level  iii if we call the securities for redemption  or iv if we take certain corporate actions 
we have the option to redeem the securities for cash on or after may   and the holders may require us to repurchase the securities at their accreted value on may of    and the purchase price for such repurchases may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock 
in december  we completed a public offering of mandatory convertible debt securities the feline prides  in which we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  the sale of an over allotment of these securities increased our total net proceeds to million 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to repay debt under our senior revolving credit facility  and the balance was used for other general corporate purposes 
each feline pride initially consists of a unit referred to as an income pride  which includes i a senior note due november  with a principal amount of  on which we will pay interest quarterly at the initial annual rate of  and ii a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder has agreed to purchase  for  shares of our common stock on november   with such number of shares to be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date 
each of the senior notes is pledged to us to secure the holder s obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
a holder of an income pride can obtain the release of the pledged senior notes by substituting certain zero coupon treasury securities as security for performance under the forward purchase contract 
the resulting unit consisting of the zero coupon treasury security and the forward purchase contract would be a growth pride  and the senior notes would be a separate security 
in august  the senior notes will be remarketed  and the interest rate will be reset  such that the total proceeds will be million 
the holders will use the proceeds of the remarketing to fund their obligations to purchase shares of our common stock under the forward purchase contract 
the number of shares of our common stock to be issued will be determined by the price of our common stock at that time  subject to the total proceeds from the remarketing equaling million 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of  with borrowings under our credit facility 
the repurchases were pursuant to two share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october and april each program authorized us to repurchase up to of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in open market transactions  with the timing of purchases and the amount of stock purchased determined at our discretion 
at december    shares remain authorized to be repurchased under these repurchase programs 
interest rate sensitivity our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
with respect to any debt financing  we may be exposed to potential fluctuations in the amount of interest expense resulting from changing interest rates 
we seek to offset such exposure in part by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
see market risk 
market risk we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage market exposures associated with our variable rate debt by creating offsetting market exposures 
as of december   we were a party  with two major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount of interest rate hedging contracts which were linked to the three month libor rate 
we closed these contracts in january in conjunction with the implementation of the new derivative accounting standard  statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as described below 
during february  we became a party  with two major commercial banks as counterparties  to million notional amount of interest rate swap contracts that are linked to the three month libor rate 
under these swap contracts  we agreed to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the notional amount 
in february  we closed million notional amount of these contracts and entered into a new million notional amount contract 
the new swap contract does not qualify for hedge accounting under fas in using these derivative instruments  we face certain risks that are not directly related to market movements and are therefore not easy to quantify  and as such are not represented in the analysis which follows 
these risks include country risk  legal risk and credit risk 
credit risk  or the risk of loss arising from a counterparty s failure or inability to meet payment or performance terms of a contract  is a particularly significant element of an interest rate swap contract 
we attempt to control this risk through analysis of our counterparties and ongoing examinations of outstanding payments and delinquencies 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis on our hedged contract assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in libor rates  sustained for three months 
this analysis reflects the impact of such movement on the combination of our senior debt under our revolving credit facility and our interest rate derivative contracts  by multiplying the notional amount of the interest rate derivative contract by the effect of a decrease in libor rates  and then factoring in the offsetting interest rate savings on the underlying senior debt 
as of march   this analysis indicated that this hypothetical movement in libor rates would have resulted in a quarterly loss  net of taxes  of approximately we have performed a similar sensitivity analysis on our unhedged contract assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in libor rates sustained for three months 
this analysis reflects the impact of such movement on our interest rate derivative contracts  by multiplying the notional amount of the interest rate derivative contract by the effect of a decrease in libor rates 
as of march   this analysis indicated that this hypothetical movement in libor rates would have resulted in a quarterly loss  net of taxes  of approximately there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain such derivative contracts at their existing levels of coverage or that the amount of coverage maintained will cover all of our indebtedness outstanding at any such time 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the derivative contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining derivative contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments in  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fas  which standardized the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment to fasb statement deferred the effective date of fas to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted fas on january   and reported a million transition adjustment  the substantial portion of which was reclassified to earnings in in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
fas  business combinations  and fas goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas limits the method of accounting for business combinations to the purchase method and establishes new criteria for the recognition of other intangible assets 
fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted fas on july  and fas on january  in accordance with fas  goodwill and any other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  ie  friess and welch forbes were not amortized from the date of their acquisition 
as a result of the effectiveness of fas  fas now requires that intangibles acquired in prior business combinations be reviewed for impairment 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of the adoption and recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
at this time  we do not expect that the adoption of these statements will result in any reclassification of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets 
on october   the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas establishes new rules for the recognition and measurement of asset impairment as well as the reporting of disposals of a business segment and the recognition of losses from the discontinuation of operations 
fas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fas on january  we do not believe that the adoption of fas will have a material effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies intangible assets in allocating the purchase price of our acquisitions and assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income projections and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we determine that we could realize these assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
economic and market conditions although domestic equity markets have experienced continued volatility and steep declines over the month period ended december   the asset management industry has experienced strong growth over the last five years 
we believe that the asset management industry will continue to grow  and that such growth will be realized at different rates in the three principal distribution channels for our affiliates products 
for example  a recent study predicts that the number of individuals with  to million in investable assets  which was estimated to be million in  will grow to million by we believe that this projected trend will result in the continued growth of the asset management industry within the high net worth distribution channel 
further  we anticipate that the evolution of so called open architecture arrangements between asset managers and unaffiliated distribution organizations will continue to have a positive impact on independent investment management organizations
