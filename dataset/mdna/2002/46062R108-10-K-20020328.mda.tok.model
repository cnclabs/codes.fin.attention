item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
certain of the matters discussed herein and elsewhere in this form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and as such may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of interpool to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
general we generate revenues through leasing transportation equipment  primarily intermodal chassis and dry freight standard containers 
most of our revenues are derived from payments under operating leases and income earned under finance leases  under which the lessee has the right to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
revenue derived from an operating lease generally consists of the total lease payment from the customer 
in   and  revenues derived from operating leases were million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues  respectively 
revenue derived from a direct finance lease consists only of income recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method 
the principal component of the direct finance lease payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in the direct finance lease 
in   and  total payments from direct finance leases were million  million  and million  respectively 
in  and  the revenue component of total lease payments totaled million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues 
our mix of operating and direct finance leases is a function of customer preference and demand and our success in meeting those customer requirements 
during the initial two years of either an operating lease or a direct finance lease  the contribution to our earnings before interest and taxes is very similar 
in subsequent periods however  the operating lease will generally be more profitable than a direct finance lease  primarily due to the return of principal inherent in a direct finance lease 
however  after the long term portion and any renewal of an operating lease expires  the operating lease will have redeployment costs and related risks which are avoided under a direct finance lease 
we conduct business with shipping line customers throughout the world and are thus subject to the risks of operating in disparate political and economic conditions 
offsetting this risk is the worldwide nature of the shipping business and the ability of our shipping line customers to ship their operations from areas of unfavorable political and or economic conditions to more promising areas 
substantially all of our revenues are billed and paid in us dollars 
we believe these factors substantially mitigate foreign currency rate risks 
our container leasing operations are conducted through our subsidiary  interpool limited  a barbados corporation 
our effective tax rate benefits substantially from the application of an income tax convention  pursuant to which the profits of interpool limited from container leasing operations are exempt from federal taxation in the united states 
these profits are subject to barbados tax at rates which are significantly lower than the applicable rates in the united states 
see united states federal income tax 
our chassis leasing operations are conducted primarily through trac lease and interpool 
the short term portion of our container leasing operations is conducted through our owned affiliate  cai 
a portion of our other united states equipment leasing activities are conducted through interpool itself 
during the three months ended september   we initiated a plan to dispose of pcr  a owned subsidiary engaged in leasing computers and related equipment  and to discontinue the operations of microtech  a owned subsidiary  also engaged in computer leasing 
as a result  pcr and microtech have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
on december   we completed the sale of our ownership stake in pcr to an investment group comprised of the management of pcr 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to our october acquisition of the north american intermodal division of transamerica leasing inc ta which resulted in million of additional leasing revenues generated from the assets acquired which were not included as assets held for sale 
in addition  finance lease revenues increased million  which includes the favorable impact of an adjustment to income earned on finance lease receivables of million related to prior periods  partially offset by decreased operating lease revenues of 
million

million  partially offset by reduced insurance expense of 
million and legal fees of 
million

the increase was primarily a result of the october acquisition of assets from ta  partially offset by reduced depreciation expense of million as a result of our sale of rail trailers and domestic containers to tip in march as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  effective october   we revised our estimate of the depreciation life of chassis from years to years 
the effect of this change was to decrease depreciation expense by million for the three months ended december  for the year ended december   the effect of this change was to decrease depreciation expense by million 
other income expense  net 
the change in other income expense  net of million was primarily due to a gain of million on the sale of the rail trailers and domestic containers previously owned by us to tip intermodal services tip  a ge capital company 
these rail trailers and domestic containers were not acquired from ta as part of the october acquisition

interest expense  net 
our net interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in net interest expense was due to increased interest expense of million  as well as decreased investment income of million

as a result of this decision  pcr and microtech have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
on december   we completed the sale of our ownership stake of pcr to an investment group comprised of the management of pcr 
our loss from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   as compared to a gain from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  the increased loss is primarily due to million of losses incurred by pcr during the year ended december   as compared to 
million of income during the year ended december  in addition  microtech incurred 
million of losses during the year ended december   as compared to 
million of income during the year ended december  the increased losses are primarily the result of a weaker economic environment 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

the increase was primarily a result of the october acquisition of assets from ta  partially offset by a million write down during for certain container equipment for which the residual value was impaired 
a specific manufacturer provided us with defective containers subject to a warranty claim  for which the expenses are not recoverable due to the bankruptcy of the manufacture 
we isolated the unit numbers of the defective containers and analyzed the proceeds received upon the sale of these defective containers 
we then reduced the book value of these defective containers to scrap value in order to approximate their net realizable value 
additionally  effective october   we revised our estimate of the depreciation life of chassis from years to years 
the effect of this change was to decrease depreciation expense by million for the three months ended december  other income expense  net

as a result of the factors described above  our income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and extraordinary gain was million in the year ended december  versus million in the year ended december  loss gain from discontinued operations 
our gain from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   as compared to a gain from discontinued operations of 
million for the year ended december  the increased gain is primarily due to

extraordinary gain 
we recorded an extraordinary gain on the retirement of debt of 
million in the year ended december  and 
million in the year ended december  net income 
as a result of the factors described above  our net income increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we use funds from various sources to finance the acquisition of equipment for lease to customers 
the primary funding sources are cash provided by operations  borrowings generally from banks  securitization of lease receivables  the issuance of capital lease obligations and the sale of our securities 
in addition  we generate cash from the sale of equipment being retired from our fleet 
in general  we seek to meet debt service requirements from the leasing revenue generated by our equipment 
since  we have been steadily increasing our fleet of chassis and containers and adding to our portfolio of finance leases 
we generated cash flow from operations of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  and net cash used for provided by financing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
we have purchased equipment costing million in  million in  and million in the following table sets forth certain historical cash flow information for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities proceeds from disposition of leasing equipment acquisition of leasing equipment investment in direct financing leases net collections on direct finance leases net proceeds payments of issuance of long term debt and capital lease obligations in excess of payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations in march  we established a container securitization facility of million 
this program provides us with a lower cost of capital for our finance lease business and access to an additional source of funding 
on march   we securitized approximately million of lease receivables through utilization of million of this facility 
this transaction was accounted for as a sale and we recorded a pre tax gain of million which is included in revenues  other costs and associated tax effect brought the net gain to million 
a portion of the gain has been deferred to record an estimate of the losses under recourse provisions for the lease receivables securitized 
included in other investment securities at december   is approximately million of retained interests in the securitized lease receivables 
in july  the container securitization facility  which was originally established as an off balance sheet source of financing  was amended allowing additional financings to be accounted for as on balance sheet secured debt financing 
at december   million of the container securitization facility was utilized  of which million relates to off balance sheet financing  while million relates to on balance sheet financing and is included in debt and capital lease obligations in the consolidated balance sheets 
in october  we established a secured financing facility in the amount of million  to fund the ta transaction 
at december   million of this facility was outstanding with an interest rate of 
the principal balance is payable in quarterly installments of 
million  with a balloon payment in october in july  we established a chassis securitization facility of million 
in october  this chassis securitization facility was increased to million 
at december   million of this facility was outstanding with an interest rate of  including the effect of interest rate swap contracts in place as of december  this facility provides us an additional source of funding and is accounted for as on balance sheet secured debt financing 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks  on december   million was outstanding  with an interest rate of  including the effect of interest rate swap contracts in place as of december  in july  this facility was renewed and amended with the term extended to july  the credit limit remains at million through july   thereafter the credit limit declines to million through july  and million through july  in addition  as of december   we had an available line of credit of million under one facility  of which million was outstanding 
the interest rate under this facility as of december  was 
subsequent to december  we have continued to incur and repay debt obligations in connection with financing our equipment leasing activities 
under our revolving credit facility and most of our other debt instruments  we are required to maintain a tangible net worth as defined of million  a fixed charge coverage ratio of to and a funded debt to net worth ratio of to at december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
in february  we issued million principal amount of notes due the notes 
the net proceeds were used to repay million in borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and for other general corporate purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  we retired million of the notes and recognized an extraordinary gain of 
million net of tax expense of 
million 
during the first quarter of  we retired million of the notes and recognized an extraordinary gain of 
million net of tax expense of 
million 
during  we retired million of the notes and recognized an extraordinary gain of 
million net of tax expense of 
million 
as of december   million principal amount of the notes remains outstanding 
in july and august   we issued million of ten year notes  comprised of million of notes due and million of notes due the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay secured indebtedness  to purchase equipment and for other investments 
during the first quarter of  we retired million of the notes and recognized an extraordinary gain of 
million net of tax expense of 
million 
during  we retired million of the notes and recognized an extraordinary gain of 
million 
as of december   million and million principal amount of the and notes  respectively  remains outstanding 
in april  we acquired a interest in cai  a container leasing company which primarily engages in short term master leases 
we also advanced cai subordinated debt 
our investment in and advances to cai totaled approximately million at december  in october  we completed the acquisition of the north american intermodal division of transamerica leasing  inc  a subsidiary of transamerica finance corporation and aegon nv under the terms of the agreement  we acquired substantially all of the domestic containers  chassis and trailers of the north american intermodal division and related assets and assumed most of the liabilities of the business 
we paid approximately million  with the acquisition being financed through a combination of cash and proceeds from committed secured financing facilities equal to approximately million 
in the acquisition  we acquired approximately  chassis   rail trailers and  domestic containers 
in march  we sold  rail trailers and domestic containers previously acquired in the transamerica transaction along with  of our existing rail trailers and domestic containers to ge capital for approximately million 
in may  our microtech subsidiary acquired a interest in personal computer rentals  inc pcr  a nationwide lessor of computers and related equipment 
we also provided financing to pcr 
during the three months ended september   we initiated a plan to dispose of pcr  a owned subsidiary  and to discontinue the operations of microtech  a owned subsidiary and liquidate its lease portfolio 
as a result of this decision  pcr and microtech have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
on december   we completed the sale of our ownership stake of pcr to an investment group comprised of the management of pcr 
during the three months ended june   we initiated a bankruptcy claim against a customer and sought to collect receivables and to recover equipment values through its insurance policies 
we have demanded the return of approximately million of equipment  including million of direct finance leases which were reclassified to leasing equipment 
the total net book value of equipment leased to this customer as of december  was approximately million 
we anticipate that approximately million of this equipment will not be recovered from the customer 
in addition  the outstanding receivables from this customer as of december  totaled approximately million of which million is covered by insurance  with the balance reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at this time  we estimate no impairment upon the liquidation and or re lease of these assets after considering anticipated insurance proceeds 
the maximum insurance coverage related to this claim is million 
the overall recovery of the asset values has been evaluated taking into consideration the equipment book value  the cost to recover and re lease the equipment  and the total outstanding receivables  as well as the likelihood to collect through the recovery and sale of the equipment or the stipulated equipment values within the insurance policy 
we recorded revenue from these leases through august  at which time  revenue recognition was discontinued  as lease payments through august  were covered by the insurance policies 
we will continue to assess the overall recovery of the asset values and adjust the assumptions used in evaluating the total insurance claim with respect to this customer s bankruptcy 
as additional information becomes available  reserves for the impairment of the asset values may be necessary based upon changes in economic conditions and the assumptions used in evaluating the total insurance claim 
as of december   commitments for capital expenditures totaled approximately million 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the net proceeds of the issuance of debt and equity securities in appropriate markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditures and required debt repayments for the next twelve months 
required debt repayments are million for the next twelve months 
in addition  we expect to rely in substantial part on long term financing for any purchase of equipment or strategic acquisitions to expand our business in the future 
we cannot assure that additional long term financing will be available for these purposes on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  from time to time  we explore new sources of capital both at the parent and subsidiary levels 
as previously announced  we have authorized the repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
the shares will be purchased from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of 
million 
a total of  shares were purchased by us during the fourth quarter of  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
from time to time  we enter into discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions or business combinations 
if additional capital were to be required for any such acquisition  there can be no assurance that such additional capital would be available on terms acceptable to us 
we previously announced that we were evaluating a possible restructuring that would involve a distribution to our stockholders of shares in a newly formed company that would operate our short term chassis leasing business 
we are not actively pursuing such a restructuring at the present time 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap contract with notional amounts totaling million 
these amounts relate to on and off balance sheet financing  of which the notional amounts are million and million  respectively 
the terms of the interest rate swap contract are for six years 
the interest rate swap contracts convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the maturity of the contract coincides with the maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
at december   the on and off balance sheet notional amounts are approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling million 
the terms of the interest rate swap contracts are for two and seven years 
the interest rate swap contracts convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the maturity of these contracts coincides with the maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
at december   the notional amount was approximately million 
in  we entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling million 
the terms of the interest rate swap contracts are for three  five and seven years 
the interest rate swap contracts convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the maturity of these contracts coincides with the maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
in  a portion of the debt instrument hedged was retired and the related portion of the swap contract was closed 
at december   the notional amount was approximately million 
prior to the adoption of statement  interest differentials paid or received under these contracts are recognized as yield adjustments to the effective yield of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
interest rate swap contracts would only be recognized at fair value if the hedged relationship is terminated 
gains or losses accumulated prior to termination of the relationship would be amortized as a yield adjustment over the shorter of the remaining life of the contract  or the remaining period to maturity of the underlying debt instrument hedged 
if the contract remained outstanding after termination of the hedged relationship  subsequent changes in market value of the contract would be recognized in earnings 
we do not use leverage swaps and do not use leverage in any of our investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
united states federal income tax we are subject to federal and state income taxes as a subchapter c corporation under the internal revenue code 
interpool  trac lease and other united states subsidiaries file a consolidated united states federal income tax return 
this consolidated group is liable for federal income taxes on its worldwide income 
personal holding company issues 
the federal income tax laws have two requirements for classifying a company as a personal holding company 
we and our subsidiaries currently satisfy the first requirement  the ownership of more than of the value of interpool s stock by five or fewer individuals 
whether or not we or any of our subsidiaries satisfy the second requirement  that at least of such corporation s adjusted ordinary gross income constitutes personal holding company income  will depend upon such corporation s income mix 
based upon current management projections  we will be considered a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes for and possibly in subsequent years 
if we or any of our subsidiaries are classified as a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes  in addition to our regular federal income tax liability  our subsidiary s undistributed personal holding company income generally taxable income with certain adjustments  including a deduction for federal income taxes and dividends paid would be subject to a personal holding company tax at the highest marginal federal income tax rate applicable to unmarried individuals 
management anticipates that for our current level of dividends will be sufficient to avoid having any undistributed personal holding company income  and thus does not anticipate that there will be any personal holding company tax imposed for there can be no assurance  however  that we will not at some point in the future become liable for personal holding company tax 
furthermore  we may at some point in the future elect to increase the dividend rate on our common stock in order to avoid personal holding company tax 
we have incurred certain losses from leasing activities that are characterized for tax purposes as suspended passive losses 
these losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset income from future leasing activities 
as of december  such suspended passive losses totaled approximately million 
trac lease 
trac lease has approximately million of net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes  which may be used only to offset the income of trac lease and  if not utilized  will expire between and the use of substantially all these loss carry forwards is subject to a number of limitations under federal tax laws 
interpool limited 
under certain circumstances  interpool may be liable for united states federal income taxes on earnings of interpool limited and any other foreign subsidiaries of ours  whether or not such earnings are distributed to us 
this would occur if interpool limited realized subpart f income as defined in the code  if it were deemed to be a foreign personal holding company or a passive foreign investment company  or if it were to have an increase in earnings invested in united states property 
subpart f income includes foreign personal holding company income  such as dividends  interest and rents 
although a substantial portion of interpool limited s income consists of rents from container leasing activities  we believe that such rents are not subpart f income because they are derived from the active conduct of a trade or business and received from unrelated persons 
however  interpool limited has received some dividend and interest income in past years  which was taxed as subpart f income 
if interpool limited were treated as a foreign personal holding company for any year  we would be taxed on the amount we would have received if interpool limited had distributed all its income to us as a dividend 
one of the conditions for treating a foreign subsidiary as a foreign personal holding company is that a minimum of of the foreign subsidiary s gross income must be foreign personal holding company income 
foreign personal holding company income does not include rental income that constitutes at least of the subsidiary s gross income 
because we expect that rental income will constitute at least of interpool limited s gross income  we do not anticipate that interpool limited will be deemed a foreign personal holding company 
a parent company is also subject to taxation when a foreign subsidiary increases the amount of its earnings invested in united states property during any calendar year 
we do not expect that interpool limited will invest any earnings in united states property 
at december  unremitted earnings of this subsidiary were approximately million 
the deferred us federal income taxes related to the unremitted earnings of this subsidiary would be approximately million  assuming these earnings are taxable at the us statutory rate  net of foreign tax credits 
united states barbados income tax convention 
interpool limited s business is managed and controlled in barbados  it also has a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the income tax convention between the united states and barbados  including any protocols and amendments the tax convention  any profits of interpool limited from leasing of containers used in international trade generally are taxable only in barbados and not in the united states 
interpool limited is entitled to the benefits of the tax convention for each year that more than of the shares of interpool limited are owned  directly or indirectly  by united states citizens or residents and its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to meet liabilities to persons who are not residents or citizens of the united states 
we believe that interpool limited passes both of these tests and should continue to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  but there can be no assurance as to this continued eligibility 
if interpool limited ceased to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  a substantial portion of its income would become subject to the united states federal income tax and the branch profits tax 
the tax convention does not afford interpool limited any relief from the personal holding company tax or any other tax that may be imposed on the undistributed earnings of a barbados corporation 
to the extent that interpool limited has united states source income that is personal holding company income or is not needed in its business  interpool limited could be taxed on this income unless it is distributed to interpool as a dividend 
we expect that interpool limited would distribute this income to interpool 
state and local taxes income taxes 
interpool and trac lease are liable for state and local income taxes on their income  and interpool limited is liable for state and local income taxes on its earnings attributable to operations in the united states 
sales tax 
to date  interpool limited and trac lease generally have not paid sales taxes on their leasing revenues to the states in which they conduct business because management has believed such revenues to be exempt from state sales taxes on several grounds  including a long standing interpretation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution that would prohibit the imposition of a tax on cargo containers and chassis used primarily for transportation of goods in interstate commerce or international trade 
recently  itel containers international corp 
itel  a container leasing company  challenged an attempt by the state of tennessee to collect sales tax on itel s proceeds from the leasing of containers delivered in tennessee 
in a ruling by the united states supreme court in february  itel s position was rejected and the court upheld the right of tennessee to impose sales tax on leasing revenues from containers delivered in tennessee 
we cannot predict the extent to which states other than tennessee will now attempt to collect sales tax on our equipment leasing revenues based on this supreme court decision 
under the terms of our equipment leases  we would be entitled to pass any such sales tax on to our lessees 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset through economies of scale achieved through expansion of the business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  to the extent effective  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
on january   we adopted statement we apply statement to only those hybrid instruments that were issued  acquired or substantively modified after december  statement  in part  allows special hedge accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
statement provides that the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedging instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk be recognized currently in earnings in the same accounting period 
statement provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements with various financial institutions 
the aggregate notional balance of the swaps was million as of december  we use these agreements to manage interest rate risks created by loans indexed to a floating rate index  primarily libor  and contractually terminate at various dates between and under previous generally accepted accounting principals  as interest rates change we accrued the interest differential payable or receivable by us on our interest rate swaps and we recognized this accrued interest differential over the life of the swap agreement 
in contrast  statement requires that changes in the fair value of the swap agreements which are designated as effective cash flow hedges be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and changes in the fair value of the swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting to be reported in earnings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk to protect its margins on existing transactions 
interest rate risk is the risk of earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates 
additionally  we consider interest rate swap contracts as an integral part of borrowing transactions 
we seek to minimize our exposure by entering into amortizing interest rate swap contracts  which coincide with the principal and maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
we do not use leveraged swaps and do not use leverage in any of our investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
for  a change in interest rates would result in a million change in pretax earnings 
for further information regarding our floating and fixed rate debt  reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk we maintain detailed credit records about our customers 
our credit policy sets different maximum exposure limits for our customers 
credit criteria may include  but are not limited to  customer trade route  country  social and political climate  assessments of net worth  asset ownership  bank and trade credit references  credit bureau reports  and operational history 
we seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining insurance coverage against defaults and equipment losses 
although there can be no assurance that such coverage will be available in the future  during we maintained contingent physical damage  recovery repatriation and loss of revenue insurance  which provides coverage in the event of a customer s default 
the policy covered the cost of recovering our equipment from the customer  including repositioning costs  the cost of repairing the equipment and the value of equipment which cannot be located or is uneconomical to recover 
it also covered a portion of the lease revenues we may lose as a result of the customer s default ie  days of lease payments following default 
we are currently negotiating the renewal of our insurance coverage which terminated on january  and expect that premium rates and deductibles could increase as a result of general rate increases for this type of insurance as well as our historical claim experience and that of our competitors in the industry
