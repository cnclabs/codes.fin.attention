capital expenditures the company made capital expenditures of million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal discontinued operations the operations of the bakery by products recycling segment have been classified as discontinued operations 
in fiscal  the company realized a gain related to a reduction in an indemnification reserve  net of tax  of million related to the sale of this business segment which was finalized on april   compared to a loss of million in fiscal liquidity  going concern risk  and capital resources the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the consolidated balance sheet at december   the company has million of debt due under its bank credit facilities classified as a current liability because the underlying credit agreement had an expiration date of june  effective june   the company entered into a series of forbearance agreements and amendments with the parties to its existing credit agreement 
the forbearance agreements and amendments  among other things  extend the credit agreement to march   raise the interest rate under the credit agreement from over prime to over prime  require the payment of a fee of million to the lenders with respect to the forbearance agreements  reduce the commitment during the forbearance period by million  from million to million  and limit financial covenants to certain minimum cash flows  based upon the company s own projected cash flow for certain periods during the forbearance period 
on march   the company entered into a recapitalization agreement 
under the terms of the recapitalization agreement  the forbearance period is extended to april   and the company and lenders will use their best efforts to consummate the recapitalization transaction  whereby the company will exchange the borrowings outstanding under its existing credit agreement  accrued interest  and forbearance fees payable for newly issued common stock equal to of the company s total outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis exclusive of stock options issued and outstanding 
the company and its lenders will use their best efforts to consummate a new credit agreement which is anticipated to result in issuance of senior term notes of million  cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a face value of million and a revolving credit agreement which will enable the company to borrow up to million 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
if the company is unable to consummate a new financing arrangement  then  in the absence of another business transaction or debt agreement  the company cannot make the principal payment due under the existing credit agreement and  accordingly  the lenders could declare a default  and attempt to realize upon the collateral securing the debt which comprises substantially all the company s assets 
as a result of this material uncertainty  there is doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the absence of a new financing arrangement creates a material uncertainty regarding the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
management is not able to predict what the outcome or consequences of these matters might be 
substantially all assets of the company are either pledged or mortgaged as collateral for borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain terms and covenants  which  among other matters  restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of cash dividends  the retention of certain proceeds from sales of assets  and the annual amount of capital expenditures  and requires the maintenance of certain minimum financial ratios 
as of december   no cash dividends could be paid to the company s stockholders pursuant to the credit agreement 
at december   the company was party to two interest rate swap agreements 
under the terms of the swap agreements  the interest obligation on million of credit agreement floating rate debt was exchanged for fixed rate contracts which bear interest  payable quarterly 
one swap agreement for million matures june   bears interest at and the company s receive rate is based on the three month libor 
the second swap agreement for million matures on june   with a one time option for the bank to cancel at june   which the bank declined to exercise  bears interest at and the company s receive rate is based on the base rate 
the company has recorded a liability of  at december   for the fair value of the two swap agreements described above 
on december   the company had a working capital deficit of million and its working capital ratio was to compared to a working capital deficit of million and a working capital ratio of to on december  upon completion of the recapitalization discussed elsewhere herein  we expect that our current liabilities will decrease by approximately million resulting in positive working capital 
in addition  the decrease in long term debt will result in reduced interest expense 
the current negative economic environment in our markets has the potential to adversely impact our liquidity in a variety of ways  including through reduced sales and potential inventory buildup 
our management has revised our sales forecasts in light of our view of current economic conditions  and believes that following the recapitalization cash generated from operations and funds available under the amended and restated credit agreement should be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that a continued slowdown in the economy or other factors will not cause us to fail to meet management s revised forecasts  or otherwise result in liquidity concerns 
moreover  in the event the recapitalization is not consummated  we are not likely to be able to continue as a going concern 
critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates which are sensitive to deviations of actual results from management s assumptions 
in particular  management makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows of acquired operations in assessing impairment of goodwill  estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the future use of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  estimates regarding the net realizable value of long lived assets held for sale  and estimates regarding self insured risks including insurance  environmental and litigation contingencies 
in assessing impairment of goodwill and the impairment of long lived assets where there has been a change in circumstances indicating the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  the company has estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from the acquired operations and from use of the asset  respectively  based on actual historical results and expectations about future economic circumstances including future business volume  finished product prices and operating costs 
the estimate of future net cash flows from the acquired operations and use of the asset could change if actual prices and costs differ due to industry conditions or other factors affecting the level of business volume or the company s performance 
in assessing impairment of long lived assets held for sale  the company has estimated the net realizable value of such assets based on information from various external sources regarding possible selling prices for such assets 
these estimates could change based on changes in market conditions  interest rates and other factors 
in estimating liabilities for self insured risks  the company considers information from outside consultants and experts  and past historical experience  in projecting future costs expected to be incurred 
these estimates could change if future events are different than assumed by management  actual costs to settle the liabilities differ from those estimated and the circumstances associated with the self insured risks change

 business combinations statement  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations statement  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement statement requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method 
statement also specifies the criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
the company does not believe statement will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
statement also requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  amortization expense related to goodwill that will not be amortized under statement was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statement  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this standard at the date of this report  including whether the company will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
statement establishes requirements for the accounting for removal costs associated with asset retirements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company is currently assessing the impact of statement on its consolidated financial statements 
statement supercedes statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
statement retains the fundamental provisions of statement but eliminates the requirement to allocate goodwill to long lived assets to be tested for impairment 
statement also requires discontinued operations to be carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years with early adoption encouraged 
the company does not expect the adoption of statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to those factors discussed elsewhere in this report  important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include the company s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the recapitalization agreement related to its credit agreement which expired june   the company s continued ability to obtain sources of supply for its rendering operations  general economic conditions in the european and asian markets  and prices in the competing commodity markets which are volatile and are beyond the company s control 
among other things  future profitability may be affected by the company s ability to grow its business which faces competition from companies which may have substantially greater resources than the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risks affecting the company are exposures to changes in prices of the finished products the company sells  interest rates on debt  and the price of natural gas used in the company s plants 
predominately all of the company s finished products are commodities that are generally sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale
