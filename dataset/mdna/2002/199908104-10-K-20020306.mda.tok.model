 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company identified its critical accounting policies based upon the significance of the accounting policy to the company s overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and its use of estimates and subjective assessments 
the company concluded that its critical accounting policy is its revenue recognition policy 
this accounting policy  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k 
the company enters into construction contracts with general contractors or end use customers based upon negotiated contracts and competitive bids 
as part of the negotiation and bidding processes  the company estimates its contract costs  which include all direct materials net of estimated rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  the amount of total contract revenue recognizable at any given time during a contract is determined by multiplying total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any given time to total estimated contract costs 
accordingly  contract revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any given point during the contract 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenues 
such revisions are frequently based on estimates and subjective assessments 
the effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
when such revisions lead to a conclusion that a loss will be recognized on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period such a conclusion is reached  regardless of what stage of completion the contract has reached 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
revenues associated with maintenance  repair and monitoring services and related contracts are recognized as services are performed 
approximately of the company s consolidated revenues were attributable to installation of systems in newly constructed buildings 
as a result  if general economic activity in the us slows significantly from current levels  and leads to a corresponding decrease in new nonresidential building construction  the company s operating results could suffer 
effective january   the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this new standard  which is discussed in new accounting pronouncements below  the new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  will entail some degree of subjective assessments 
results of operations historical year ended december  in thousands revenues    cost of services    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    goodwill amortization    restructuring charges  operating income    other expense  net    reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net  income loss before income taxes    income tax expense    net income loss    compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  to billion in compared to the decline in revenue for was comprised of a decline in revenues related to operations that were sold or shut down during late or in and a reduction in revenues from ongoing operations 
the company s ongoing revenues declined slightly in this results in part from a general slowing in the us economy 
the company s revenue decline is also consistent with management s decreased emphasis on revenue growth in favor of improvement in profit margins  operating efficiency  and cash flow 
in view of these factors  the company may continue to experience revenue declines or only modest revenue growth in upcoming periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that this strategy will continue to lead to improved profit margins in the near term 
in addition  if general economic activity in the us slows significantly from current levels  the company may realize further decreases in revenue and lower operating margins 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  gross profit remained at in as compared to excluding operations that were sold or shut down during late or in  gross profit decreased million  or  to million and gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in the company s gross profit margin was hurt by subpar gross profit performance from certain ongoing operations that are undergoing operational and management changes 
the results of these operations generally improved in the second half of as compared to the first half 
the negative effect on gross profit percentages of these operations was offset by the divestiture of certain operations that performed poorly in and by the improvement in four of the company s larger operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in excluding operations that were sold or shut down during late or in  sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to and sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in during the fourth quarter of  the company estimated and recorded bad debt expense of approximately million related to the company s receivables with kmart  in light of that company s recent bankruptcy filing in january excluding both the kmart receivables reserve as well as operations sold or shut down in late or in  sg a declined million  or  to million  and as a percentage of revenue  from in to in the decreases in sg a primarily related to operations that were sold or shut down as well as to a concerted effort to reduce sg a throughout the company 
restructuring charges during the first quarter of  the company recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to contractual severance obligations of two operating presidents in connection with the company s significant restructuring program undertaken in the second half of these restructuring charges are net of a gain of approximately million related to management s decision to sell a small operation during the first quarter of as announced by the company in the third quarter of  management performed an extensive review of its operations during the second half of as part of this review  management decided to cease operating at three locations  sell five operations including two smaller satellite operations  and merge two companies into other operations 
as a result of these decisions  the company estimated and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily associated with restructuring efforts at certain underperforming operations and its decision to cease its e commerce activities at outbound services  a subsidiary of the company 
the restructuring charges were primarily non cash and included goodwill impairments of approximately million and the writedown of other long lived assets of approximately million 
the remaining restructuring items primarily include severance and lease termination costs 
these restructuring actions are substantially complete 
during the third quarter of  the company decided to retain one of the operations that was previously held for sale and reversed approximately million of non cash charges related to the anticipated loss on the sale of this operation 
this amount was offset by an additional loss on the sale in late september of the final operation that was identified as part of this restructuring program 
the losses associated with the other operations that were sold were consistent with the amounts recorded as restructuring charges in other expense  net other expense  net  decreased million  or  to million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense as a result of the decline in the company s average debt levels throughout as compared to reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net during  the company recorded a non cash charge of approximately million primarily related to the impairment of certain non operating assets  principally notes receivable from former owners of businesses acquired by the company 
this charge also included an impairment of approximately million to the company s minority investment in two entities associated with the distribution and implementation of high end engineering and design software 
these entities have ceased operations 
offsetting these items was a gain of approximately million on the reduction of the company s subordinated note payable to a former owner in connection with the settlement of claims with this former owner 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the company s provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill attributable to certain acquisitions 
in  the company reported income tax expense of million even though it reported a pre tax loss of million 
this occurred primarily because large restructuring related writedowns of goodwill that contributed to its book loss were not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding these writedowns for tax purposes resulted in positive taxable income and  therefore  tax expense in compared to revenues revenues increased million  or  to billion in compared to the revenue growth was comprised of approximately internal growth and for acquisitions that are included in the company s results for the full year of revenue growth of approximately included in the total growth of resulted from the company s ability to increase volume by subcontracting portions of projects to other contractors 
approximately one half of the internal growth was attributable to the company s largest single operation 
this growth represented substantial increases in volume at this operation  which did not result in commensurate increases in profitability due to scarce technical and skilled labor and customer scheduling and site restrictions related to strong business conditions 
the company has experienced these kinds of challenges at numerous other operations as well  and believes they reflected high levels of activity and capacity constraints for the construction industry in general during as a result  management placed less emphasis on revenue growth and more on operations  cash flow  efficiency and profit margin improvements in and across all operations 
it is likely  therefore  that the company will continue to experience revenue declines or only modest revenue growth in upcoming periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that this strategy will lead to improved profit margins in the near term 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in during  the company experienced significant execution shortfalls on certain projects at its largest operation  and at an operating location on the west coast  and at a location in the southeast 
these execution shortfalls resulted from difficulty in obtaining quality skilled and technical labor in certain markets  scheduling changes imposed by customers  and from poor pricing and estimating by two previous operating managers 
the company also experienced weak operating performance at several locations relating to ongoing turnaround efforts and execution difficulties 
as part of the restructuring review during discussed below  the company decided to cease operating at or sell eight of these locations 
these units reported a combined negative gross profit of million during gross profit in was also reduced  to a lesser extent  by the company s e commerce activities which were discontinued in the fourth quarter of the costs associated with these decisions are included in the restructuring charges as discussed below 
the remaining decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted from increased labor costs  pricing pressures in certain markets and scheduling and efficiency challenges associated with labor availability and productivity at the high levels of activity that most of the company s operations experienced in the company has also increased the amount of activity it subcontracts to third parties 
pricing to the company s customers of such subcontracted work generally carries lower margins than the company s self performed work 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a increased from in to in this increase in sg a as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the inclusion in of results of companies acquired in that had higher sg a as a percentage of revenues than the rest of the company s operations 
these acquisitions included outbound services where the company incurred significantly higher sg a to support expansion of its e commerce activities 
during the th quarter of  the company decided to cease its e commerce activities at outbound  and costs associated with this decision are included in restructuring charges as discussed below 
the company also increased corporate and regional office spending in to support the requirements of a larger organization  and to increase its efforts to obtain more national account and energy project business 
in addition  as discussed above  the company experienced weak performance in at several locations related to turnaround efforts and execution difficulties 
in connection with these challenges  these companies incurred a disproportionate amount of sg a in as compared to their revenues 
during the latter part of  the company identified and wrote off certain accounts receivable that were deemed uncollectible 
this resulted in the need for increased provisions for bad debt in sg a  which also contributed to the company s higher sg a as a percentage of revenues 
restructuring charges during the second half of  management performed an extensive review of its operations 
as part of this review  management decided to cease operating at three locations  sell five operations including two smaller satellite operations  and merge two companies into other operations 
as a result of these decisions  the company estimated and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily associated with restructuring efforts at certain underperforming operations and its decision to cease its e commerce activities at outbound services  a subsidiary of the company 
the restructuring charges were primarily non cash and included goodwill impairments of approximately million and the writedown of other long lived assets of approximately million 
the remaining restructuring items primarily include severance and lease termination costs 
the aggregate results for related to the operations and activities included in the restructuring charges were revenues of million and operating losses of million 
other expense  net other expense  net  increased million  or  to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to additional borrowings and consideration paid for companies acquired in reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net during  the company recorded a non cash charge of approximately million primarily related to the impairment of certain non operating assets  principally notes receivable from former owners of business acquired by the company 
this charge also included an impairment of approximately million to the company s minority investment in two entities associated with the distribution and implementation of high end engineering and design software 
these entities have ceased operations 
offsetting these items was a gain of approximately million on the reduction of the company s subordinated note payable to a former owner in connection with the settlement of claims with this former owner 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to for the company s provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill attributable to certain acquisitions 
in  the company reported income tax expense of million even though it reported a pre tax loss of million 
this occurred primarily because large restructuring related writedowns of goodwill that contributed to its book loss were not deductible for tax purposes 
excluding these writedowns for tax purposes resulted in positive taxable income and  therefore  tax expense in results of operations restated financial information due to subsequent divestiture of certain operations on february   the company entered into an agreement with emcor group  inc emcor to sell operations 
under the terms of the agreement  the total purchase price is approximately million  including debt assumed by emcor of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
this transaction closed on march  the company expects that net of taxes  transaction costs  and escrows  approximately million of this amount will be used to reduce debt 
in addition  the company expects that it will take certain steps to reduce its costs in light of the smaller size of the company following the emcor transaction 
as a result  the company currently expects it will record restructuring charges of not less than million  before taxes  in the first quarter of under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which takes effect for the company on january   the operating results of units being sold as well as any gain or loss on the sale of these operations will be presented as discontinued operations in the company s statement of operations for the first quarter of this reporting will be separate from income statement items for ongoing operations 
based on estimates of the net assets of these operations and on estimates of transaction costs  the company expects to realize an estimated loss on the sale of these operations of approximately million in the first quarter of  exclusive of tax liabilities 
approximately million of this loss will be included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see new accounting pronouncements below for further discussion 
the following supplemental financial information reflects restated financial information for and in light of this transaction 
these restated financial statements do not consider any allocation of corporate overhead to the discontinued operations  and therefore  sg a does not reflect any potential reductions in corporate costs in response to this major change in the company 
a portion of the company s interest expense  which is included in other expense  net  has been allocated to the discontinued operations based upon the company s net investment in these operations 
therefore  interest expense related to continuing operations does not reflect the pro forma reduction of interest expense from applying the proceeds from the sale of these operations to reduce debt in any earlier periods

the company s internal revenue growth for is lower than the growth it experienced throughout this results in part from a general slowing in the us economy 
the company s lower revenue growth in is also consistent with management s decreased emphasis on revenue growth in favor of improvement in profit margins  operating efficiency  and cash flow

excluding both the kmart charge as well as operations sold or shut down in late or in  sg a declined million  or  to million  and as a percentage of revenue  from in to in sg a as a percentage of revenues is higher than historical levels because this restated financial information does not allocate any corporate overhead to the discontinued operations  and therefore  sg a does not reflect any potential reductions in corporate costs in response to this major change in the company

offsetting these items was a gain of approximately million on the reduction of the company s subordinated note payable to a former owner in connection with the settlement of claims with this former owner 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the company s provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill attributable to certain acquisitions 
the effective tax rate of for is primarily due to the high level of permanent differences primarily non deductible goodwill amortization as compared to the level of pre tax income from continuing operations 
in  the company reported income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million 
this is primarily because of large restructuring related writedowns of non deductible goodwill that contributed to the book loss 
the effective tax rate is expected to decrease significantly in future periods as compared to due to the elimination of goodwill amortization for book purposes in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash provided by operating activities less customary capital expenditures plus the proceeds from asset sales is generally called free cash flow and  if positive  represents funds available to invest in significant operating initiatives  to acquire other companies or to reduce a company s outstanding debt or equity 
if free cash flow is negative  additional debt or equity is generally required to fund the outflow of cash 
for the year ended december   the company had free cash flow of million  an increase of million as compared to free cash flow of million in this improvement primarily resulted from faster billing by the company for its project work coupled with modest improvement in the average days to collect receivables once billed  as well as from a decrease in net capital expenditures versus the prior year 
free cash flow in was million 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this primarily reflects a net reduction of long term debt of million 
in  million was used in financing activities 
this primarily reflects a net reduction of long term debt of million 
in  financing activities provided million primarily from net borrowings of long term debt used to fund acquisitions 
revolving credit facility the company s principal debt financing is a revolving credit facility the credit facility or the facility provided by bank one  texas  na bank one and other banks including bank one  the bank group 
as of december   the credit facility provided the company with a revolving line of credit of up to the lesser of million or of accounts receivable  net of reserves net receivables 
borrowings outstanding under the facility as of december  were million 
in connection with the company s sale of operations to emcor as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k and in results of operations above  the company agreed in february to pay down debt under the facility by at least million  and to reduce the size of the facility to the lesser of million or of net receivables 
this transaction closed on march  the company expects that net of taxes  transaction costs  and escrows  approximately million of the cash proceeds will be used to reduce its bank debt 
borrowings under the facility are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  fixed assets other than real estate  and the shares of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the credit facility expires on january   at which time all amounts outstanding are due 
the company has a choice of two interest rate options under the facility 
under one option  the interest rate is determined based on the higher of the federal funds rate plus or bank one s prime rate 
an additional margin of to is then added to the higher of these two rates 
under the other interest rate option  borrowings bear interest based on designated short term eurodollar rates which generally approximate london interbank offered rates or libor plus to 
the additional margin for both options depends on the ratio of the company s debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined 
commitment fees of to per annum  also depending on the ratio of debt to ebitda  are payable on the unused portion of the facility 
the credit facility prohibits payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares by the company  limits certain non bank group debt  and restricts outlays of cash by the company relating to certain investments  capital expenditures  vehicle leases  acquisitions and subordinate debt 
the credit facility also provides for the maintenance of certain levels of shareholder equity and ebitda  and for the maintenance of certain ratios of the company s ebitda to interest expense and debt to ebitda 
as noted above in results of operations  the company estimated and recorded an allowance of million in the fourth quarter of against its receivables with the kmart corporation based on kmart s bankruptcy filing in january including this reserve  the company s fourth quarter ebitda did not meet the facility s minimum ebitda covenant 
the bank group agreed to exclude the kmart reserve from covenant calculations 
as a result  the company has no unresolved covenant violations under the facility 
as a result of the substantial reduction in debt following the emcor transaction  the company believes that it currently complies with the facility s debt to ebitda and ebitda to interest expense covenants by comfortable margins 
the bank group has agreed to adjust the facility s minimum ebitda covenants to reflect the company s reduced size following the emcor transaction 
while the company expects to be in compliance with these new ebitda requirements  the minimum ebitda covenant allows less room for variance than the facility s other financial covenants 
if the company violates this or any other covenant  it may have to negotiate new borrowing terms under the facility 
while the company believes that its improved creditworthiness following the emcor transaction would result in a successful negotiation of new terms if necessary  there can be no assurance that it could obtain terms acceptable to the company 
in view of these restrictions  the facility s january maturity  and the company s improved creditworthiness  the company has started the process of seeking more flexible borrowing arrangements 
as of december   the company had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had incurred interest expense at an average rate of approximately for the year ended december  the company also had million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility at yearend 
while not actual borrowings  letters of credit do reflect potential liabilities under the facility and therefore are treated by the bank group as a use of borrowing capacity under the facility 
letters of credit are discussed below under other commitments 
unused borrowing capacity under the facility based upon the most restrictive covenant was million as of december  as of march   the company had million outstanding under the facility as a result of using proceeds from the emcor transaction to reduce its borrowings  and unused borrowing capacity of approximately million under the facility 
the company expects to make payments of taxes and other costs related to the emcor transaction of approximately million in early second quarter of this would have resulted in million outstanding under the facility as of march   if these payments had been made contemporaneously with the closing of the emcor transaction 
the company estimates its current all in floating interest rate under the facility to be approximately 
in connection with the reduction of the facility s size as well as the company s expectation of obtaining new debt arrangements as noted above  the company expects to write off in the first quarter of as much as million  before tax benefits  of deferred arrangement fees associated with its current facility 
notes to affiliates and former owners subordinated notes were issued to former owners of certain purchased companies as part of the consideration used to acquire their companies 
these notes had an outstanding balance of million as of december  these notes bear interest  payable quarterly  at a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  million of these notes are convertible by the holders into shares of the company s common stock common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
in connection with the company s sale of operations to emcor as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k and in results of operations above  million of subordinate debt was assumed by emcor 
as a result of this assumption as well as scheduled principal payments that have already occurred in  the outstanding balance of subordinate debt as of march  was million 
the maturities on this remaining debt are million in and million in substantially all of the maturities are due on april  other commitments as is common in the company s industry  the company has entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in the company s balance sheets 
the company s significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees 
the company enters into noncancelable operating leases for many of its facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow the company to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  the company has no further obligation to the lessor 
the company may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term 
typically the company is liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
some customers require the company to post letters of credit to guarantee performance under the company s contracts and to ensure payment to the company s subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
certain of the company s vendors also require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on behalf of the company  such as to beneficiaries under the company s self funded insurance programs 
such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that the company has failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  the company may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
to date the company has not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by the issuer of the letter of credit or by the company 
the company believes that it is unlikely that it will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require the company to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that the company will perform under the terms of a contract and that the company will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if the company fails to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
the company must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  the company has not had any significant reimbursements to its surety for bond related costs 
the company believes that it is unlikely that it will have to fund claims under its surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
the company s future contractual obligations include in thousands less than one year thereafter total debt obligations    operating lease obligations        excluding the operations that were sold to emcor  operating lease commitments would have been as follows at december  in thousands less than one year      thereafter  for a total commitment of  as of march   the company had million outstanding under the facility as a result of using proceeds from the emcor transaction to reduce its borrowings 
the company also had million in letters of credit outstanding under the facility at yearend 
while not actual borrowings  letters of credit do reflect potential liabilities under the facility and therefore are treated by the bank group as a use of borrowing capacity under the facility 
unused borrowing capacity under the facility based upon the most restrictive covenant was million as of december  the company s other commercial commitments expire as follows in thousands less than one year thereafter total letters of credit   treasury stock on october   the company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to buy up to million shares of its common stock 
during  the company purchased approximately million shares at a cost of approximately million 
during  the company purchased approximately million shares at a cost of approximately million 
under the current terms of the credit facility  the company is prohibited from purchasing additional shares of its common stock 
outlook the company anticipates that cash flow from operations as well as borrowings under lending facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s normal cash needs 
as noted above  the company has certain relatively tight restrictions under the credit facility 
if the company violates these or certain other restrictions under the facility  it may be required to negotiate new terms with its banks 
while the company believes that its improved creditworthiness following the emcor transaction would result in a successful negotiation of new terms if necessary  there can be no assurance that it could obtain terms acceptable to the company 
in view of these restrictions  the facility s january maturity  and the company s improved creditworthiness  the company has started the process of seeking more flexible borrowing arrangements 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  the company expects its revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  the company s volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria for recording intangible assets other than goodwill in connection with business combinations 
sfas no 
requires companies to assess goodwill assets for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
sfas no 
also introduces a more stringent framework for assessing goodwill impairment than the approach required under existing rules 
in addition  sfas no 
discontinues the regular charge  or amortization  of goodwill assets against income 
sfas no 
took effect upon issuance in july sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning january  and early adoption is not allowed for calendar year companies 
under sfas no 
 any impairment loss recognized in accordance with the initial adoption will be shown as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
under this treatment  the company s statement of operations would show after tax results of operations both with and without the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognizing an impairment 
under previous standards  the company recognized a non cash charge of approximately million per year in its statement of operations through december  to amortize its goodwill assets over year lives 
this amortization was discontinued beginning january  under the new standard 
the new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
based on a preliminary review of the new standards  the company believes that it will record a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of between million and million 
the company anticipates that this charge will be recorded in the first quarter of when the new standard becomes effective 
as noted above  this charge will be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company has specifically provided for the possibility of a non cash goodwill impairment charge in its lending agreements with its banks and accordingly  expects no impact on its current bank credit facility as a result of this charge 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under sfas no 
 the operating results of the companies being sold to emcor as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k and in results of operations above  as well as any gain or loss on the sale of these operations will be presented as discontinued operations in the company s statement of operations for the company believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the lack of a combined operating history and the difficulty of integrating formerly separate businesses  retention of key management  a national downturn or one or more regional downturns in construction  shortages of labor and specialty building materials  difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with debt financing or bonding  seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems and the use of incorrect estimates for bidding a fixed price contract 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results or cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to integrate and further consolidate the companies it has acquired 
these businesses operated as separate  independent entities prior to their affiliation with the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or institute the necessary systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  to effectively manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis 
the historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results of the company because  among other reasons  the company s subsidiary operations were not under common control or management prior to their acquisition 
there are also risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities resulting from the acquired businesses operations prior to the acquisition 
the existing senior management at many of the company s subsidiary operations is generally comprised of former owners who committed to stay with their operations after acquisition 
certain of these individuals have suffered losses in the company stock or have lower incomes than they averaged when they owned their former businesses 
further  former owners generally have noncompetition obligations that expire on the fifth anniversary of their date of acquisition  and thus these obligations expire from july through there is no assurance that the company will be able to retain these individuals or find suitable replacements if such individuals leave the company 
the failure to retain or replace such management on a timely basis could negatively impact results from operations at such locations 
key elements of the company s strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability and cash flow of the individual businesses 
the company s level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside the company s control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for the company s services 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems by the company requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
in addition  the company depends on the senior management of the businesses it acquires and regional and corporate management to remain committed to the success of the company 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain and increase its productivity and profitability is also affected by its ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet the company s service requirements  and to retain senior management at the corporate  regional and local level 
the company s ability to generate positive cash flow at its historical levels in the future could be adversely impacted by a reduction in its billings and collections as a result of a decline in new projects 
the risk associated with a decline in new projects could be further perpetuated by the company s faster billing for its project work in the past year because the company will continue to incur costs on older projects where payment may have already been received from the customer 
such indebtedness  together with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the company s debt instruments  could limit its ability to borrow additional funds 
additionally  failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
hvac systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future 
the company s failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the company s future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  the increasing supply of tradable stock  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events
