corporate history 
since our inception in  we have capitalized on the popularity of themed collectibles and toys 
we became well known in the early s for our officially licensed collectible die cast replicas of popular race cars 
we capitalized on our status as a pioneer of this market to become a leading producer of other automotive die cast replicas 
these products were primarily sold in the mass retail channel under our racing champions brand 
on april   an investor group led by willis stein partners  lp and some members of our management consummated a recapitalization transaction in which our foreign and domestic operations were combined 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and provided us with a stronger platform to manage our business more effectively 
following several years of strong growth  we completed an initial public offering in june in the offering  we sold approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
this offering provided us with additional capital to grow our business through internal initiatives and acquisitions 
in june  we acquired wheel sports group  inc subsequently renamed racing champions south  inc for million shares of our common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all financial information is presented as if this transaction had been effected as of the beginning of the earliest reporting period 
the purchase of wheel sports group built upon our strength in the racing segment by expanding our product lines to include collectible sports trading cards  souvenirs and apparel 
in april  we acquired the ertl company  inc for approximately million in cash 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and accordingly  the operating results of ertl have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition 
ertl is a premier producer and marketer of collectibles and toys focused on agricultural and heavy equipment die cast vehicle replicas  classic and high performance die cast vehicle replicas  custom imprint die cast vehicle replicas  preschool toys  collectible figures and hobby model kits 
the combination dynamically transformed us into the company now known as racing champions ertl 
integration initiatives 
during and  we focused on integrating our acquisitions  particularly ertl 
we implemented numerous initiatives to achieve synergies and cost savings from these acquisitions 
for example  we relocated certain tooling and production to china from mexico  combined offices and warehouses in the united states  hong kong and china  and eliminated excess facilities  consolidated back office and support functions and systems  simplified the organizational structure  eliminated redundant functions and right sized facilities across the combined entity  and eliminated unprofitable products and product lines 
in  we realized significant benefits from the integration  which reduced ertl s inventory and resulted in increased profitability and cash flow 
our gross margins increased from in to in and our selling  general and administrative expenses declined  from million in to million in from our highest debt level after the ertl acquisition closed  we have reduced our bank debt by million to million as of december  through our integration initiatives and active working capital management 
sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of collectibles and toys and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
we market our products through a variety of distribution channels  including mass retailers  specialty and hobby wholesalers and retailers  oem dealers  corporate promotional accounts  and direct to consumer 
for the years ended december    and  sales to mass retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed in north america  europe and asia pacific 
international sales constituted less than of our net sales for each of the last three years 
we expect international sales to increase over the next several years as we expand our geographic reach 
our net sales have not been materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers and oem dealers 
our top five customers accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
wal mart and the john deere dealer network  our largest customers  accounted for and of our net sales in  respectively 
other than wal mart and the john deere dealer network  no other customer accounted for more than of our net sales in  or we provide customers the option to take delivery of our products either in the united states or the united kingdom with credit terms ranging from to days or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
since direct sales from china reduce our distribution and administrative costs  we generally grant price discounts of to on these sales  which results in lower gross profit margins for these sales compared to sales completed in the united states or the united kingdom 
therefore  annual fluctuations in the mix of products delivered in the united states or the united kingdom versus products delivered in china will affect year to year comparability of net sales and gross profit margins 
however  we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products delivered in the united states or the united kingdom due to the elimination of distribution and certain administrative costs 
for the years ended december    and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not sell our products on consignment and ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
returns and allowances have ranged from to of net sales over the last three fiscal years 
expenses 
cost of sales primarily consists of purchases of finished products  which accounted for  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
the remainder of our cost of sales includes tooling depreciation  freight in from the supplier and concept and design expenses 
substantially all of our purchases of finished products are denominated in hong kong dollars and  therefore  subject to currency fluctuations 
historically  we have not incurred substantial expense due to currency fluctuations because the hong kong government has maintained a policy of linking the us dollar and the hong kong dollar since selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of royalties  employee compensation  advertising and marketing expenses  freight out to customers and sales commissions 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid on a product to various licensors 
in  aggregate royalties by product ranged from approximately to of our selling price 
royalty expense for was approximately of our net sales 
sales commissions range from to of the net sales price and are paid quarterly to our external sales representative organizations 
in  sales subject to commissions represented of our net sales and sales commission expense was of our net sales 
seasonality 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  substantial fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and operating results  which is typical of many companies in our industry 
our business is highly seasonal due to high consumer demand for our products during the year end holiday season 
approximately of our net sales over the two years ended december  were generated in the second half of the year 
as a result  our investment in working capital  mainly inventory and accounts receivable is generally highest during the fourth quarter and lowest during the first quarter

since we implemented this program in  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock for approximately million  equating to an average stock price of per share 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  cash on hand and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet anticipated operating needs for working capital financing requirements are usually highest during the third and fourth quarters due to seasonal increases in demand for our collectibles and toys 
in addition  we expect that capital expenditures during  principally for molds and tooling  will be approximately million
