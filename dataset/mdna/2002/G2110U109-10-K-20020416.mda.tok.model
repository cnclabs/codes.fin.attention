significant accounting policies our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more significant judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of our intangible assets may be impaired  management performs an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
intangible assets consisted of acquired website technology which was amortized on the straight line basis over two years 
management s analysis indicated that the carrying value of the acquired website technology was not recoverable from future cash flows 
the company therefore wrote off the balance of unamortized acquired website technology of rmb  us  as of december  to the statement of operations 
deferred tax assets the company is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from net operating loss carryforwards 
this assessment takes into consideration of the availability and character of future taxable income 
as management estimates that there will be no taxable income generated for the foreseeable future  no deferred tax assets are recognized in the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the point of sale for retail sales and upon the delivery of goods for other sales  when all performance obligations have been completed and is reasonably assured collectibility 
rental income is recognized on the straight line basis over the lease terms 
dividend income is recognized upon the establishment of the right to receive such payment 
liquidity and capital resources the company s and its subsidiaries primary liquidity needs are to fund inventories and operating expenses  and to expand business operations 
the company has financed its working capital requirements through internally generated cash and advances from a former vice president 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was rmb million us million  rmb million us  and rmb million us million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash flows from the company s operating activities are attributable to the company s income and changes in operating assets and liabilities  net cash provided by operating activities in included approximately rmb million us million of cash proceeds from the disposal of marketable securities 
the company had a working capital surplus of approximately rmb million us million as of december   compared to that of approximately of rmb million us million as of december  the decrease was mainly attributable to the company paying approximately rmb million us million cash and foregoing approximately rmb million us million in receivables due from the farming bureau as partial consideration for the minority interest of harc 
net cash used in investing activities in mainly attributable to the consideration paid for the minority interest of harc as stated above and rmb million us million loans advanced to third parties  of which rmb million us  was repaid before december  except as disclosed above  there have been no significant change in the financial condition and liquidity during the year 
the company believes that internally generated funds will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated working capital needs for at least the next months 
factors relating to forward looking statements factors that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements include the following risks associated with foreign operations o our principal subsidiaries operate in the people s republic of china  and are  by law  subject to administrative review by various national  provincial and local agencies of the chinese government governmental oversight and or changes to existing rules and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations 
o the company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected by economic conditions and changes in the policies of the prc government  such as changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof  including measures which may be introduced to regulate or stimulate the rate of economic growth 
the rate of deflation of the prc economy  based on published consumer price information  was percent for  percent for and percent for the prc government has taken certain measures to stimulate domestic demand and consumption 
there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
o all of the company s sales and purchases are made domestically and are denominated in renminbi 
accordingly  the company and its subsidiaries do not have material market risk with respect to currency fluctuation 
as the reporting currency of the company s consolidated financial statements is also renminbi  there is no significant translation difference arising on consolidation 
however  the company may suffer exchange loss when it converts renminbi to other currencies  such as hong kong dollars or united states dollars 
o the company s interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of renminbi and hong kong dollars interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents 
as of december   the company s cash equivalents are mainly renminbi and hong kong dollar deposits with financial institutions  bearing market interest rates without fixed term 
o while we are a nevada corporation  our officers and directors are non residents of the united states  our assets are located in the prc and our operations are conducted in the prc  therefore  it may not be possible to effect service of process on such persons in the united states  and it may be difficult to enforce any judgments rendered against us or such persons 
general risks of operations o we have discontinued many of our operations and we are currently dependent upon the success of one line of business our supermarket operations  while our supermarket operations generate operating revenues  those revenues are not sufficient to offset expenses  resulting in continued losses from operations 
o unless we are able to reduce expenses  increase our profit margins and or acquire profitable operations  we will likely continue to incur losses and investors in our shares may be unable to recoup their investment 
o we intend to investigate and evaluate potential acquisition candidates  however  we may be unable to acquire business operations that prove to be profitable  we will continue to incur administrative and professional expenses in connection with our evaluation and acquisition of business operations  without corresponding revenues from those operations prior to acquisition 
o as of december   the company had short term investments in marketable securities in the hong kong stock market and nasdaq market with a total market value of rmb million us 
these investments expose the company to market risks that may cause the future value of these investments to be lower than the original cost of such investments at the time of purchase 
o the market for our common stock is not active and the limited trading volume in our shares could result in substantial market volatility in the price for our shares 
o our supermarket operations face competition from larger  more capitalized companies than ours and we may be unable to compete successfully 
o we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future we intend to reinvest earnings from operations  if any  back into our operations 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and the following data was extracted from the financial information contained in the company s quarterly reports on form qs 
however  as the company did not recognize the loss on disposition of assets amounted to rmb million us million in the second quarter of  the company will restate the quarterly results of operations by filing amendments to the quarterly reports on form qs for the quarters ended june  and september  in thousands  except share and march june september december per share data rmb rmb rmb rmb net sales     cost of sales     net income loss income from continuing operations     income from discontinued operations earnings loss per common share basic and diluted income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net sales     cost of sales     net income loss income from continuing operations     income from discontinued operations earnings loss per common share basic and diluted income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations the computation of diluted earnings loss per share did not assume the conversion of the stock options in and because their inclusion would have been antidilutive
