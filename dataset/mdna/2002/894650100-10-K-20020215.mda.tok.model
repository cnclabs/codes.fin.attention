item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic film and aluminum extrusions 
we also have two operating subsidiaries focused on healthcare related technologies and an investment subsidiary 
descriptions of our businesses and interests are provided on pages our manufacturing businesses are quite different from our other interests 
our manufacturing businesses can be analyzed and valued by traditional measures of earnings and cash flow  and because they generate positive ongoing cash flow  they can be leveraged with borrowed funds 
our healthcare related operating companies  molecumetics and therics  are start up companies active in drug research  drug delivery and tissue engineering 
each generates operating losses and negative cash flow in the form of net r d expenditures 
neither has licensed products to date  and revenues consist entirely of collaboration revenues r d support payments 
they may never generate profits or positive cash flow 
if they were stand alone  independent operations  they would typically be financed by private venture capital 
our investment subsidiary is comprised of high risk stakes in technology start up companies  primarily in the areas of communications  life sciences and information technology 
our primary objective in making these investments is to generate high after tax internal rates of return commensurate with the level of risk involved 
in summary  we have a variety of business interests with dramatically different risk profiles  which makes the communication of operating results more difficult  especially since we have only one class of stock 
as a result  the segment information presented on pages and the business segment review on pages are critical to understanding our operating results and business risks 
results of operations versus revenues 
net sales in decreased by to million compared with million in the lower net sales are due primarily to a decline in volume in aluminum extrusions of in due to adverse economic conditions and cyclical downturn in the end use markets we serve 
volume in film products was down slightly  however  the impact on net sales of lower overall volume in film products was offset by higher sales from operations in europe and china and higher sales of new higher value products 
net losses for tredegar investments totaled million million after income taxes in while in there were net gains of million million after income taxes 
pretax realized gains and losses from investment activities are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income on page and in venture capital investments in the operating profit by segment table on page the stand alone operating expenses primarily management fee expenses in and primarily employee compensation and benefits and leased office space and equipment in and for our venture capital investment activities are classified in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in the consolidated statements of income and in venture capital investments in the operating profit by segment table 
these expenses totaled million in  million in and million in for more information on net sales and investment activities  see the business segment review on pages operating costs and expenses 
the gross profit margin during remained flat at  with higher margins realized in film products offset by lower margins in aluminum extrusions 
the margin improvement in film products was driven by higher sales of new higher margin products 
the gross profit margin in film products in was negatively impacted by higher production costs associated with the commercialization of new products 
the gross profit margin erosion in aluminum extrusions was due primarily to lower volumes causing a decline in total variable contribution available to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
competitive pricing pressures also had an adverse impact 
sg a expenses in were million  down slightly from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower net expenses related to bad debts and returned goods in in film products  expenses for bad debts and returned goods declined approximately million  while in aluminum extrusions  these expenses increased approximately  and higher pension income included in sg a increase of

financial condition assets total assets decreased to million at december   from million at december   mainly due to a decrease in the carrying value of venture capital investments down million  see note beginning on page  and a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory down million due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of these decreases were partially offset by the following an increase in cash and cash equivalents up million  see discussion on page  and higher prepaid pension assets up million due to pension income recognized during the year 
liabilities and available credit total liabilities were million at december   down from million at december   primarily due to the impact of the following lower accounts payable consistent with lower levels of inventory and sales down million  and lower net deferred income tax liability down million primarily due to an increase in write downs of venture capital investments and a decrease in the unrealized gains on available for sale securities see note on page 
the decreases in the above were partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities up million due primarily to accruals for plant shutdowns and divestitures up million and the accrual for derivative financial instruments up million  see note on page 
debt outstanding of million at december   consisted of a million term loan maturing in  a note payable with a remaining balance of million and other debt assumed in acquisitions of million 
we also have a revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to million no amounts borrowed at december  
the facility matures on july   and tredegar expects to have a new facility in place by april  see note on page for more information on debt and credit agreements

in addition  income tax benefits on write downs of venture capital investments typically lag financial reporting recognition 
consequently  despite pretax losses after operating expenses from venture capital investment activities of million in  cash provided by operating activities includes related income taxes paid of  for the year 
pretax gains after operating expenses for venture capital investment activities were million in and cash used in operating activities includes related income taxes paid of million 
the remaining differences between and are primarily due to a decrease in the level of capital expenditures down million  a decrease in working capital  increased spending at tredegar biotech  and lower income from manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures in reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and press modernization at the aluminum extrusions plant in kentland  indiana  a new plastic films manufacturing facility in shanghai  china this plant makes film for primarily hygiene products and began production in continued expansion of plastic films manufacturing capacity at the facility in hungary this plant produces disposable films for hygiene products marketed in europe  machinery and equipment purchased for a new production line at the plant in terre haute  indiana  and machinery and equipment purchased to upgrade production lines at the plant in kerkrade  the netherlands

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tredegar has exposure to the volatility of interest rates  polyethylene and polypropylene resin prices  aluminum ingot and scrap prices  foreign currencies  emerging markets and technology stocks 
see note on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products  however  those changes are generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices  but fluctuations are also generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices  however  there is no assurance that higher ingot costs can be passed along to customers 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than twelve months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 
we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants

we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
we believe that our exposure to the canadian dollar has been substantially neutralized by the us dollar based spread the difference between selling prices and aluminum costs generated from canadian casting operations and exports from canada to the us we have investments in private venture capital fund limited partnerships and early stage technology companies  including the stock of privately held companies and the restricted and unrestricted stock of companies that have recently registered shares in initial public offerings 
the portfolio is subject to risks typically associated with investments in technology start up companies  which include business failure  illiquidity and stock market volatility 
furthermore  publicly traded stocks of emerging  technology based companies have higher volatility and risk than the us stock market as a whole 
see the business segment review that begins below and note beginning on page for more information 
forward looking and cautionary statements from time to time  we may make statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on our then current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following film products film products is highly dependent on sales associated with one customer  p g 
p g comprised of our net sales in  in and in the loss or significant reduction of sales associated with p g would have a material adverse effect on our business  as would delays in p g rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by tredegar 
while we have undertaken efforts to expand our customer base  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful  or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with p g 
growth of film products depends on our ability to develop and deliver new products  especially in the hygiene market  which comprised over of film products net sales in each of the last three years 
hygiene products are now being made with a variety of new materials  replacing traditional backsheet and other components 
while we have substantial technical resources  there can be no assurance that our new products can be brought to market successfully  or if brought to market successfully  at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films 
a shift in customer preferences away from our technologies  our inability to develop and deliver new profitable products  or delayed acceptance of our new products in domestic or foreign markets  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
film products operates in a field where our significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios 
the continued success of this business depends on our ability not only to protect our own technologies and trade secrets  but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents 
although we are not currently involved in any patent litigation  the outcome of any such action could have a significant adverse impact on film products 
as film products expands its hygiene business  we have greater credit risk that is inherent in broadening our customer base 
aluminum extrusions sales volume and profitability of aluminum extrusions is cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end use markets in the united states and canada  particularly in the construction  distribution and transportation industries 
our market segments are also subject to seasonal slowdowns during the winter months 
from to the second quarter of  profits in aluminum extrusions grew as a result of positive economic conditions in the markets we serve and manufacturing efficiencies 
however  a slowdown in these markets in the second half of resulted in a decline in sales volume and decline in ongoing operating profit compared with the second half of the aluminum extrusions industry continued to be affected by poor economic conditions in our sales volume declined and operating profit declined in compared with the decline in ongoing operating profit at approximately two to three times the rate of the decline in sales volume illustrates the operating leverage inherent in our operations fixed operating costs 
any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts that usually accompany a downturn 
the markets for our products are highly competitive with product quality  service and price being the principal competitive factors 
as competitors increase capacity or reduce prices to increase business  there could be pressure to reduce prices to our customers 
in addition  competition from foreign extruders could result in loss of market share due to their ability to produce at lower costs and sell at lower prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain current margins and profitability 
our continued success and prospects depend on our ability to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross cycle growth 
tredegar biotech molecumetics and therics have incurred losses since inception  and we are unsure when  or if  these operating companies will become profitable 
we have not been able to bring any drug compounds or bone replacement products to the point of human testing 
there can be no assurance that any new drug compounds or bone replacement products can be brought to market successfully 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to internally develop preclinical  clinical  regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities  or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide those functions 
we may not be successful in developing these capabilities or entering into agreements with third parties on favorable terms 
further  our reliance upon third parties for these capabilities could reduce our control over such activities and could make us dependent upon these parties 
our inability to develop or contract for these capabilities would significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda and other regulatory authorities will clear our products in a timely manner 
we are highly dependent on several principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our biotechnology businesses and results of operations  and could inhibit product development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future r d work is critical to our success 
competition for experienced scientists is intense 
failure to recruit and retain executive management and scientific personnel on acceptable terms could prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that can determine who has the right to develop a particular product 
no clear policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims covered by biotechnology patents in the united states 
the biotechnology patent situation outside the united states is even more uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our products without any compensation to us 
tredegar investments the success  continued existence and value of the early stage technology companies in which we invest depends on their ability to create or develop commercially viable products or businesses  and raise additional capital when needed 
the possibility that companies in which we invest will not be able to meet their milestones or commercialize their technology  product or business concept presents significant risk 
additionally  companies in which we make seed or expansion round investments will often require substantial additional equity financing to satisfy continuing working capital requirements 
each round of venture financing is typically intended to provide a company with only enough capital to reach the next stage of development 
we cannot predict the circumstances or market conditions under which the companies in which we invest will seek additional capital  however  current market conditions are not favorable 
companies that are unsuccessful in raising the needed additional capital are likely to fail  leaving little or no liquidation value for investors 
many of the venture capital investments we hold are illiquid 
for private companies in which we have invested  there is no secondary market for our shares and there is no assurance that one will be available in the near future 
additionally  once a company becomes publicly traded  there is generally a period of time in which we are not permitted to trade the securities the lock up period  which is generally six months 
the success of our venture capital investments will be significantly affected by the state of the securities markets in general and  more specifically  the market for initial public offerings  the market for communications  life science and information technology companies  and the market for mergers and acquisitions 
we anticipate that a significant portion of our returns will be realized through initial public offerings of companies in which we have invested or through merger and acquisition activity 
the market for initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity is cyclical in nature 
thus  we cannot be certain that the securities markets will be receptive to initial public offerings or merger and acquisition activity  particularly those of early stage companies 
as seen during  any adverse change in the market for initial public offerings could significantly impact our ability to realize our investment objective 
valuing our venture capital investments is difficult and inexact 
we value our venture capital investments based on our best estimate of the value of each individual investment 
there is typically no public market for our investments in privately held companies 
we will consult with venture funds and consulting firms when needed to assist in the valuation of our investments 
valuation is inherently subjective 
the net asset value set by management may not reflect the price at which we could sell our shares in the open market 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued two new standards that primarily affect the accounting for acquisitions initiated after june   and the accounting for goodwill 
there are transition provisions that may result in the reclassification of carrying values among existing goodwill and other intangible assets 
once adopted  these standards prohibit amortization of goodwill  but require transitional and annual impairment reviews that may result in the recognition of losses  among other requirements 
we anticipate that adoption of these standards will result in an annual reduction of amortization expense of approximately million million after income taxes 
additionally  we will reclassify from intangible assets to goodwill approximately  related to the therics workforce  which no longer qualifies as a separately identifiable intangible asset 
we will adopt these standards in the first quarter of the financial accounting standards board has also issued a new standard affecting the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard will be adopted during the first quarter of and is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements 
business segment review film products sales 
film products sales were million in versus million in total volume for the year declined to million pounds from million pounds down 
the decline in volume is primarily due to lower demand for our diaper backsheet film 
the impact of the volume decline on net sales was offset by higher sales from operations in europe and china and higher sales of new  higher value specialty film components for diapers and feminine hygiene products 
film products sales increased by in due to the acquisition of exxon films on may  see note on page and raw material driven price increases 
total volume for the year was up due to the acquisition of exxon films 
on a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition of exxon films occurred at the beginning of  annual sales for film products declined by and volume declined by 
the decline in volume was due to lower volumes in traditional diaper backsheet due to the transition to cloth like breathable materials  lower volume due to the continuing decline in market share of a major customer  and lower volume due to the loss of some traditional diaper backsheet business in foreign markets to local competition in those markets 
operating profit 
film products operating profit excluding unusual items was million in  up from million in the improvement in operating profit was due to growth in foreign operations  including higher profits in europe up million  including million due to a full year of operations for adma and promea  and china up million partially offset by lower profits in brazil and argentina down million  a shift away from our diaper backsheet film to higher margin specialty film components for diapers and feminine hygiene products  and a reduction in charges for bad debts and returned goods impact of million 
film products operating profit excluding unusual items was million in  down from million in the decline in operating profit was due to manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the rollout of cloth like breathable laminate backsheet for diapers  lower volume from the transition to new products and lower customer market share as noted above  higher costs related to new product development and commercialization efforts  and a third quarter charge of million for doubtful accounts related to two diaper film customers 
identifiable assets 
identifiable assets in film products were million in compared with million in while overall identifiable assets did not change significantly between years  growth opportunities in foreign markets combined with excess capacity in domestic plants resulted in a shift of assets from domestic to foreign locations 
consequently  identifiable assets increased in europe up million and china up million while declining in the united states down million 
identifiable assets declined in brazil and argentina down million on a combined basis due primarily to asset write downs in argentina resulting from deteriorating business and economic conditions 
identifiable assets in film products were million in  up from million in due primarily to the impact of the following capital expenditures in excess of depreciation and amortization million  a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory reflecting lower sales volume down million  and the write off of goodwill in connection with the write off of excess production capacity million 
depreciation  amortization and capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization for film products was million in  down slightly from million in due to plant rationalizations 
depreciation and amortization for film products was million in  up from million in due to the acquisition of exxon films in and capital expenditures up million over 
the acquisition of exxon films generated goodwill of million  million of which was written off in due to excess production capacity 
the required adoption of a new accounting standard effective january   will result in the elimination of goodwill amortization 
had the new standard been effective in  amortization expense for film products would have been reduced and operating profit would have increased by million 
capital expenditures in film products in reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and a new manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  continued expansion of manufacturing capacity at the facility in hungary  machinery and equipment purchased for a new production line at the plant in terre haute  indiana  and machinery and equipment purchased to upgrade lines at the plant in kerkrade  the netherlands

aluminum extrusions sales 
sales in aluminum extrusions declined to million in compared with million in annual volume declined to million pounds from million pounds in the aluminum extrusions industry continues to be affected by poor economic conditions 
despite these conditions  we believe we have maintained our market share see our market segments in the table on page 
sales in aluminum extrusions increased by in compared with primarily due to higher average selling prices reflecting higher raw material costs 
volume declined by due to weakening demand from transportation  distribution and construction markets during the second half of the year 
operating profit 
operating profit excluding unusual items declined to million in compared with million in due to the decline in volume and pricing pressure related to weak economic conditions 
operating profit excluding unusual items decreased by in primarily due to lower volumes resulting from weakening demand in our major markets during the latter half of the year  higher per unit conversion costs and competitive pricing pressures 
identifiable assets 
identifiable assets in aluminum extrusions were million  down from million in the decrease is primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory reflecting lower sales combined decrease of million  and an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment of million related to the closure of the plant in el campo  texas 
identifiable assets in aluminum extrusions were million in  down from million in due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of million reflecting lower sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  partially offset by capital expenditures in excess of depreciation and amortization of million 
depreciation  amortization and capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization for aluminum extrusions was million in  up from million in due primarily to capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization for aluminum extrusions was million in  up slightly from million in due primarily to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and the modernization of one of the presses at the plant in kentland  indiana  and machinery and equipment purchased for the plant in newnan  georgia 
capital expenditures in reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and the second phase of a press modernization program at the plant in newnan  georgia total capital outlays for this project were approximately million with million spent in  million spent in and million spent in  and the press modernization project at the plant in kentland  indiana
