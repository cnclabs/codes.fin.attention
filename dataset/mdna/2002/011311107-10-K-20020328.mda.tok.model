proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes or  subject to certain limitations  acquisition activities 
the loan agreement contains certain financial covenants  which are customary in credit facilities of this nature including minimum financial ratio requirements and limitations on dividends  indebtedness  liens and investments

the company s borrowing levels for working capital are seasonal with the greatest utilization generally occurring in the first quarter and early spring

inflation the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
euro conversion on january   the european economic and monetary union emu entered a three year transition phase during which a new common currency  the euro  was introduced in participating countries which established fixed conversion rates through the european central bank ecb between existing local currencies and the euro 
from that date  the euro is traded on currency exchanges 
following introduction of the euro  local currencies remained legal tender until december  during this transition period  goods and services could be paid for with the euro or the local currency under the emu s no compulsion  no prohibition principle 
france and netherlands  countries where the company has locations  were participating countries in the first group to adopt the emu 
the uk is currently not a part of the emu 
based on its evaluation to date  management believes that the introduction of the euro has not had a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro will ultimately have on the marketplace  and there is no guarantee that all issues will be foreseen and corrected or that other third parties will address the conversion successfully 
the euro introduction did not have a material impact on the company s overall currency risk 
the company anticipates the euro will simplify financial issues related to cross border trade in the emu and reduce the transaction costs and administrative time necessary to manage this trade and related risks 
however  the company believes that the associated savings will not be material to corporate results

in the first quarter of fiscal year we are evaluating the effect of the adoption of fas no 
 however the company does not expect a material impact to its consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted statement of financial standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its amendments  statements and  on january  fas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company has designed its foreign currency hedge agreements as cash flow hedge instruments 
the hedge agreements are used to manage exposure to exchange rate movement by effectively changing the variable rate to a fixed rate 
the critical terms of the foreign currency hedge agreements and the sales associated with the hedging agreements are the same  therefore  the company has assumed that there is no ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship 
changes in fair value of the foreign currency hedging agreements will be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax effects  until the hedged items are recognized in earnings 
the company has hedged of its exposure to foreign exchange rate movement through march  at january   the foreign currency hedge agreements were in an unfavorable position by approximately  in accordance with the transition provisions of fas  the net of tax cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment on january   was a loss of  in accumulated other comprehensive income with a deferred income tax asset of  at december   the fair value of the hedge agreements were in an unfavorable position  therefore  the derivative financial instruments were adjusted to a liability of  accumulated other comprehensive income was adjusted to an accumulated loss of  and the deferred income tax was adjusted to a  tax asset 
as the hedge agreements are deemed to be effective cash flow hedges  there was no income statement impact related to hedge ineffectiveness 
the company has reclassifed approximately  of existing losses in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes  into net income loss through december  critical accounting policies inventories obsolescence and slow moving at december   the company had  in reserve to cover obsolescence and slow moving inventory 
the reserve is calculated on a basis of no inventory usage over a three year period on inventory with quantity on hand is deemed obsolete and reserved at percent and slow moving inventory with little usage requires a percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than three year supply 
the company relies on historical information to support its reserve 
sales discounts at december  the company had  in reserves for sales discounts on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs 
the company basis its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk as a result of international sales a portion of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk  france and canada 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the us or us subsidiaries of the company distributes their products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company regularly hedges by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency sales transactions over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had  outstanding forward exchange contracts related to sales  additionally there was an exchange contract of  relating to a short term inter company cash transfer 
a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
exposure to exchange rates as a result of international sales the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries  as a result of the sales of its products in international markets 
foreign currency options and forward contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ending december  comparatively  at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately  for the year ended december  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a loss of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the french franc closed at 
relative to british pound 
at december  the euro dollar closed at 
relative to us dollar 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the french franc closed at 
relative to british pound 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk at december  the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such actions 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
