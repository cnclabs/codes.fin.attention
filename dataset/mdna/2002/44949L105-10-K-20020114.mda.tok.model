asset impairment writedown in assessing and measuring the impairment of long lived assets  the company applies the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the long lived asset or identifiable intangible being tested for impairment was acquired in a purchase business combination  the goodwill that arose in that transaction is included in the asset grouping in determining whether an impairment has occurred 
if some but not all of the assets acquired in that transaction are being tested  goodwill is allocated to the assets being tested for impairment based on the relative fair values of the long lived assets and identifiable intangibles acquired at the acquisition date 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
additionally  where an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets and identifiable intangibles where goodwill has been allocated to the asset grouping  as described immediately above  the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill is impaired eliminated before reducing the carrying amounts of impaired long lived assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to the carrying amounts of goodwill remaining after the testing for impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles  including enterprise level goodwill not subject to impairment testing under sfas no 
 the company assesses such carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of this goodwill by determining whether the amortization of goodwill over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired business 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted operating cash flows compared to the carrying value of such goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  certain fixed assets and intangible assets were identified as impaired 
as a result of the overall softening of the electronics manufacturing services industry and a change in the company s business strategy  the company does not believe that their future cash flows support the carrying value of the long lived assets and goodwill 
the current market values were compared to the net book value of the related long lived assets with the difference representing the amount of the impairment loss 
the effect of this impairment recognition totaled approximately million  of which million represented a writeoff of goodwill and million represented a writedown of property  plant and equipment 
during the fourth quarter of  certain fixed assets were no longer in use and identified as impaired 
the equipment was marketed for sale  and as such  the carrying value of these assets was written down to the estimated recoverable sales value  net of commissions  obtained from appraisals and used equipment quotations 
the effect of this impairment recognition totalled approximately  and was included with depreciation expense for the year ended september  in fiscal   of these assets were returned to active use due to volume increases 
page of liquidity and capital resources as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for  of the million of cash provided by operating activities  million was used to fund investing activities  and million was used to pay down bank debt 
capital additions were million in and million in these expenditures were primarily used to upgrade the manufacturing capabilities of the company 
as of september   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its secured asset based credit agreement 
as of december   the company s banks waived the non compliance  amended certain covenants to allow the company more flexibility and changed the expiration date of the credit agreement from january  to february  under the terms of the amendment  the revolving credit facility component of the agreement  based on eligibility criteria for receivables and inventory  was reduced from million to million 
amounts borrowed are limited to of qualified accounts receivable  of raw materials and of finished goods inventory  but in no event is the inventory borrowing base greater than million 
the second component consists of a million three year term loan with monthly principal installments based on a five year amortization which began in april at september   million was outstanding  consisting of million and million relating to the revolving credit facility and term loan  respectively  with an additional million available under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of certain changes to inventory and receivables to reflect contingencies involved in pending litigation  the company is currently in violation of the amended agreement 
subject to resolution related to the company s violation of the amended agreement  the availability under the revolver at december   under the most recent amendment was million 
interest on this revolving credit facility is determined at the company s option on a libor or prime rate basis  plus a margin 
a facility fee is paid on the unused portion of the facility 
the credit facility contains specific affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  the maintenance of certain financial covenants  as well as limitations on amounts available under the lines of credit relating to the borrowing base  capital expenditures  lease payments and additional debt 
the more restrictive of the covenants require the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio  and a minimum earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
as a result of certain charges to inventory and receivables to reflect contingencies involved in pending litigation recorded on january   included in the accompanying financial statements as of september   the company is in violation of the amended agreement 
the company is currently in discussions with other lending institutions with respect to a new credit agreement 
while the company believes it will be successful  there can be no assurance that it will meet the february   expiration date of the current agreement 
since the company s loan agreement currently expires on february   it has classified the entire term loan and revolver as current debt 
the company s liquidity is dependent on the ability to generate positive cash flow 
provided the company obtains a new credit agreement by february   or obtains an extension of its existing credit agreement and providing it meets with substantial success in its pending litigation and meets its performance targets  management believes the company will generate sufficient cash flows in to meet the obligations 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations for the last three years has been minimal due to the fact that it is able to adjust its bids to reflect any inflationary increases in cost
