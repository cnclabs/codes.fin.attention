these statements relate to expectations concerning matters that are not historical fact 
accordingly  statements that are based on management s projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  plans  estimates  approximately  intend  and other similar words and phrases  or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  could  and may 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates  judgments  and projections about our business and our industry  and they involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  judgments  and estimates  forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  contingencies  and other factors that could cause our or our industry s actual results  level of activity  performance or achievement to differ materially from those discussed in or implied by any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us and could cause our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
in evaluating these statements  some of the factors that you should consider include those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this document  and the following general economic and market conditions  either nationally or in the markets where we conduct our business  may be less favorable than expected  inability to find suitable equity or debt financing when needed on terms commercially reasonable to us  inability to locate suitable facilities or personnel to open or maintain distribution center locations  inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or  if identified  an inability to consummate any such acquisitions  interruptions or cancellation of sources of supply of products to be distributed or significant increases in the costs of such products  changes in the cost or pricing of  or consumer demand for  our or our industry s distributed products  an inability to collect our accounts or notes receivables when due or within a reasonable period of time after they become due and payable  a significant increase in competitive pressures  and changes in accounting policies and practices  as may be adopted by regulatory agencies as well as the financial accounting standards board 
many of these factors are beyond our control and you should read carefully the factors described in the risk factors under item business of this document 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this document 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto which are included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america and which require the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure and reported amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements 
significant estimates which are reflected in these consolidated financial statements relate to  among other things  allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable  amounts reserved for obsolete and slow moving inventories  net realizable value of inventories  estimates of future cash flows associated with assets  asset impairments  and useful lives for depreciation and amortization 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  inventories  intangible assets  investments  other receivables  expenses  income items  income taxes and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets  liabilities  certain receivables  allowances  income items and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and there can be no assurance that estimates  assumptions and judgments that are made will prove to be valid in light of future conditions and developments 
if such estimates  assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect in the future  the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are based upon its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
conversely  if the financial condition of the company s customers is stronger than that estimated by the company  then the company s estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable may prove to be too large and reductions in its allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable may be required 
if additions are required to allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable  the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolete or slow moving inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumed market conditions 
if actual market conditions are or become less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if inventory write downs are required  the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company maintains accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in its financial statements 
in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america  since goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminate lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually  except in certain circumstances and whenever there is an impairment  there is a possibility that  as a result of an annual test for impairment or as the result of the occurrence of certain circumstances or an impairment  the value of goodwill or other intangible assets with indeterminate lives may be written down or may be written off either in one write down or in a number of write downs  either at a fiscal year end or at any time during the fiscal year 
the company analyzes the value of goodwill using the estimated future cash flows of the related business  the total market capitalization of the company  and other factors  and recognizes any adjustment to the asset s carrying value 
any such write down or series of write downs could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported results of operations  and any such impairment could occur in connection with a material adverse event or development and have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company seeks revenue and income growth by expanding its existing customer base  by opening new distribution centers and by pursuing strategic acquisitions that meet the company s various criteria 
if the company s evaluation of the prospects for opening a new distribution center or of acquiring an acquired company misjudges its estimated future revenues or profitability  such a misjudgment could impair the carrying value of the investment and result in operating losses for the company  which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability  financial condition and cash flows 
the company files income tax returns in every jurisdiction in which it has reason to believe it is subject to tax 
historically  the company has been subject to examination by various taxing jurisdictions 
to date  none of these examinations has resulted in any material additional tax 
nonetheless  any tax jurisdiction may contend that a filing position claimed by the company regarding one or more of its transactions is contrary to that jurisdiction s laws or regulations 
in such an event  the company may incur charges to its income statement which would adversely affect its net income and may incur liabilities for taxes and related charges which may adversely affect its financial condition 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june revenues of the company during the fiscal year ended june  increased by approximately  compared to the fiscal year 
this increase may be attributed primarily to revenues generated from new distribution centers opened in fiscal and during the last quarter of fiscal approximately  offset by the loss of revenues that had been generated from distribution centers closed or consolidated approximately cost of sales increased between the and fiscal years at a greater rate than the increase in revenues between these fiscal years 
accordingly  cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june   and gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  this decline is attributable to competitive pricing pressures in certain market areas and a product mix in certain market areas which did not yield as high a gross profit margin as other product mixes that were achieved in other market areas 
in addition  in light of the economic uncertainties that arose as a result of the events of september   certain sales and collection incentives were instituted in october which negatively impacted gross profit margins 
these incentives cost the company approximately million in gross profit  although they resulted in a then substantial reduction in the company s accounts and notes receivable and strengthened the company s then financial position 
operating expenses including non cash charges for depreciation and amortization increased by approximately  between the and fiscal years 
approximately  of this increase may be attributed to the operating expenses of the new distribution centers and approximately  may be attributed to increased payroll and related expenses  offset by decreases in operating expenses of closed or consolidated distribution centers of approximately  additionally  in light of the softening of economic conditions in certain of our market areas during fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter  the company added approximately  to its reserve for doubtful accounts

impact of inflation general inflation in the economy has driven the operating expenses of many businesses higher  and  accordingly  we have experienced increased salaries and higher prices for supplies  goods and services 
we continuously seek methods of reducing costs and streamlining operations while maximizing efficiency through improved internal operating procedures and controls

sfas no 
also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial positions 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
this statement also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no

management believes that these statements will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  other than from the cessation of the amortization of goodwill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the estimated fair value of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and what it believes are appropriate valuations and methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented here are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses the carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
long term debt interest rates that are currently available to the company for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value for bank debt 
the carrying amounts comprising this item are reasonable estimates of fair value  except for a note due in october such note has a carrying value of  and an estimated fair market value of approximately  at june  the fair value estimates are based on pertinent information available to management as of june  although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since june  and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented 
the company has not entered into  and does not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
the company is currently exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since the majority of the company s long term debt obligations are at variable rates 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
based on the amount outstanding as of june   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate  change in the company s annual interest expense 
for fixed rate interest rate obligations  changes in market interest rates affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact the company s earnings or cash flows
