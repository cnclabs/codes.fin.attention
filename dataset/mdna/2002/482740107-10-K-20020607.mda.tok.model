item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed throughout this report and specifically under the caption cautionary statement regarding forward looking information 
in addition  the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
background we develop  acquire  manufacture and market technologically distinguished branded and generic prescription pharmaceutical products 
we also enter into licensing agreements with pharmaceutical marketing companies to develop and commercialize additional brand name products 
until the mid s  we derived most of our revenues from our manufacturing and licensing activities 
today  we derive most of our revenues from our product sales 
while we expect to continue to enter into new licensing agreements  we emphasize the development or acquisition and marketing of technologically distinguished prescription products  whether branded or generic  through our ther rx and ethex business lines  as well as specialty raw materials through particle dynamics 
in  we established our ethex business to market and distribute technologically distinguished generic and non branded alternative drugs that use our proprietary technologies 
net revenues from ethex have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we launched our ther rx business in to market branded pharmaceutical products 
we acquired and introduced our first two of seven ther rx branded products  micro k r and precare r  in march and august  respectively 
ther rx has also introduced four internally developed product line extensions to precare r since october  including primacare tm  the first prescription prenatal postnatal nutritional supplement with essential fatty acids specially designed to help provide nutritional support for women during pregnancy  postpartum recovery and throughout the childbearing years 
in june  we launched our first nda approved product  gynazole r  a one dose prescription cream treatment for vaginal yeast infections 
net revenues from ther rx have increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  allowance for inventories  sales allowances and useful life or impairment of other intangibles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and sales allowances 
we recognize revenue at the time product is shipped to customers 
we establish sales provisions for estimated chargebacks  discounts  rebates  returns  pricing adjustments and other sales allowances concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the sales provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including but not limited to  actual return and historical experience by product type  the number and timing of competitive products approved for sale  the expected market for the product  estimated customer inventory levels by product  price declines and current and projected economic conditions and levels of competition 
actual product returns  chargebacks and other sales allowances incurred are  however  dependent upon future events 
we continually monitor the factors that influence sales allowance estimates and make adjustments to these provisions when management believes that actual product returns  chargebacks and other sales allowances may differ from established allowances 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we extend credit on an uncollateralized basis primarily to wholesale drug distributors and retail pharmacy chains throughout the united states 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  percentage of accounts receivable by aging category and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
historically  our actual losses from uncollectible accounts have been insignificant 
allowance for inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out basis 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
as appropriate  we make provisions to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
other intangible assets 
other intangible assets consist of brand product rights purchased from other pharmaceutical companies  all of which are being amortized over year periods 
the amortization periods for product rights are based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
these factors include the product s position in its life cycle  competitive positioning  the existence or absence of like products in the market and various competitive and technical issues 
other intangible assets also consist of patents and trademarks  which are being amortized over periods ranging from five to years 
as of march   the net carrying amount of other intangibles was million 
amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are in the process of reassessing the useful lives of our intangible assets  determining which intangible assets  if any  have indefinite lives and evaluating the extent of impairment  if any  of indefinite lived intangible assets that may need to be recorded see recently issued accounting standards below for a discussion on sfas 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations in the following table  we have summarized our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues

specialty generic product sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal specialty generic product sales comprised of net revenues in fiscal compared to of net revenues in fiscal the increase in specialty generic sales was primarily due to a million increase in the sales volume of existing products coupled with million of incremental sales from new products 
the cardiovascular product line  which comprised of specialty generic sales  accounted for million of the total sales growth 
we introduced new products in fiscal the volume growth experienced by specialty generics was partially offset by million of product price erosion that resulted from normal and expected competitive pricing pressures on certain products 
specialty raw material product sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal specialty raw material product sales comprised of net revenues in both fiscal and fiscal the increase in specialty raw material product sales was primarily due to sales of new products and increased sales of existing products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increased level of product sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the higher gross profit percentage in fiscal resulted primarily from a shift in the mix of product sales toward higher margin branded products comprising a larger percentage of net revenues and favorable cost variances associated with increased production 
the positive impact of these two factors was partially offset by the price erosion in certain specialty generic products discussed above 
operating expenses 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher costs associated with clinical testing connected to our internal product development efforts and higher personnel expenses related to expansion of our research and development staff 
research and development expense as a percentage of net revenues was flat at in fiscal compared to fiscal in april  we announced that we had received favorable results from screening studies on a number of products utilizing one of our newest drug delivery technologies 
because of the significant revenue and profit potential of these products  we plan to increase our research and development expenditures by approximately to in fiscal over fiscal levels 
selling and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expense was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs associated with administration and branded marketing 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal other expense income

net revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net revenues was due primarily to higher sales of specialty generic and branded products 
branded product sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in sales was due to the introduction of gynazole r  a vaginal antifungal product  at the end of the first quarter of the fiscal year and higher sales of existing women s health care products 
the introduction of gynazole r contributed million of incremental sales in fiscal due to increases in market share 
since its june launch  the product has captured of total prescriptions written for vaginal antifungal creams 
existing women s health care products increased million  or  in fiscal  due primarily to higher volume associated with increased market share of the precare r brand prenatal vitamin line 
including gynazole r  total sales of women s health care products increased in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower sales of the micro k r cardiovascular potassium supplement 
micro k r sales were down million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of speculative customer buying during the latter half of the prior year in anticipation of a year end price increase 
specialty generic product sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to incremental volume from new products introduced in fiscal million  a full year of sales of products introduced in fiscal million  net volume increases across the existing product line million  and increased pricing million  primarily on cardiovascular products 
we introduced new products in fiscal the increase in volume of the existing products was attributable to higher generic substitution rates  increased sales associated with trade shows and price increase buy ins 
specialty raw material product sales were practically flat at million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a soft market in the general industry 
contract services and other revenues declined million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in contract services and licensing revenues was primarily due to lower contract manufacturing volume  reflecting a smaller customer base as we purposefully have de emphasized lower margin contract manufacturing in our business strategy 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increased level of product sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the higher gross profit percentage in fiscal was due primarily to favorable changes in product mix  lower costs within the specialty generic line  and higher pricing in the branded and generic line 
lower costs in specialty generics were due to favorable cost variances from increased volume and lower prices for material and ingredients 
of the percentage point net increase  changes in product mix accounted for  higher pricing accounted for and lower costs accounted for of the improvement 
operating expenses 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to payments made in connection with product co development agreements and expansion of the research and development staff 
research and development expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher corporate administrative expenses  incremental marketing expenses in support of the specialty generics product line and continued investment in expanding the sales force for the branded products marketing division 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal corporate administrative expense was higher due to increases in payroll related expenses of million associated with expanding our management and administrative infrastructure to keep pace with our continued growth  higher professional fees of million for various legal and consulting services and increased lease expense of million from the acquisition of a leased facility for future expansion of our distribution operations and administrative offices 
marketing and selling expense associated with branded products increased million in fiscal  due primarily to expenses associated with the increase in the branded sales force and increased sampling costs in connection with the introduction of gynazole r in fiscal amortization expense was primarily attributable to the product acquisitions of micro k r and pre care r 
these product acquisitions are being amortized on a straight line basis over years and there was no change compared to the prior year 
other income expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to lower long term debt outstanding on our line of credit 
other income decreased million in fiscal due primarily to a non recurring gain related to an arbitration award of million received in fiscal and a decrease in interest income of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
net income 
as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding the effect of the non recurring gain  net income increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents and working capital were million and million  respectively  at march   compared to million and million  respectively  at march  the increasing level of net income associated with higher product sales continues to be the primary source of operating capital which we utilize to fund our businesses 
the net cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in operating cash flow resulted from an increase in receivables  offset partially by higher net income and increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in receivables was primarily due to certain delayed customer payments  which were collected subsequent to year end  and the timing of wholesaler purchases within the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to year end  through may   we have collected approximately million of the march  accounts receivable balance outstanding 
the increase in accounts payable reflected increased trade payables  which resulted from the timing of various material purchases  while the increase in accrued liabilities was attributable to a higher current tax liability 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal were funded by net cash flows from operating activities 
our investment in capital assets was primarily for purchasing machinery and equipment to upgrade and expand our pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
we believe we have adequate resources to fund the estimated cost of million to complete construction in progress at march  long term debt decreased to million at march  compared to million at march  the decrease resulted from principal payments made during fiscal in december  we refinanced a million building mortgage that was due in june the building mortgage bears interest at and is due in december during december  we increased our revolving credit agreement with lasalle national bank to million 
the revised agreement provides for the continuation of our million revolving line of credit along with a supplemental credit line of million for financing acquisitions 
the revolving credit lines are unsecured 
at march   we had no borrowings outstanding under either credit facility and million in open letters of credit issued under the revolving credit line 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  in thousands and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt    operating leases       total contractual cash obligation       we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance  cash flows from operations and funds available under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund operating activities for the presently foreseeable future  including the payment of short term and long term debt obligations  capital improvements  research and development expenditures  product development activities and expansion of marketing capabilities for the branded pharmaceutical business 
however  we continue to examine opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of or investment in companies  technologies  product rights  research and development and other investments that are compatible with our existing business 
we intend to use our available cash to help in funding any acquisitions or investments 
cash has been invested in short term  highly liquid instruments 
we may also use funds available under our credit facilities  or financing sources that subsequently become available  including the future issuances of additional debt or equity securities  to fund these acquisitions or investments 
if we were to fund one or more such acquisitions or investments  our capital resources  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted in future periods 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
however  we believe that the net effect of inflation on our operations has been minimal during the past three years 
in addition  changes in the mix of products sold and the effect of competition has made a comparison of changes in selling prices less meaningful relative to changes in the overall rate of inflation over the past three years 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and for purchase business combinations completed on or after july  it also requires  that upon adoption of sfas  we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill based on certain criteria in sfas sfas addresses accounting for intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
the statement also addresses accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment using fair values 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our previous business combinations were accounted for using the purchase method 
as of march   the net carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets was million and million  respectively 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill ceased effective april  amortization of goodwill during the year ended march  was  at this time  we are reassessing the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets  determining which intangible assets  if any  have indefinite lives and evaluating the extent of impairment  if any  of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that may need to be recorded 
amortization of other intangible assets was million during the year ended march  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and certain provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves other implementation issues related to sfas this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  based on our current operations  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the emerging issues task force issued eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf codified and reconciled the task force s consensuses on prior issues and identified other issues related to various aspects of the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf requires certain items we previously had reported as selling expenses to be reclassified as reductions of revenues in the income statement 
eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and we adopted it for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended march  in connection with the adoption and to conform to current period presentation  we reclassified certain prior period items which had been included in selling and administrative expenses to reduce net revenues 
however  the reclassification did not affect reported net income or net sales growth rates 
item a 
quantitive and qualitive disclosures about market risk not applicable
