factors that could affect the company s future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include  but are not limited to  lower than anticipated growth from existing customers  an inability to attract new customers  an inability to successfully integrate acquisitions  technology changes  or a decline in the financial stability of the company s customers 
negative developments in these or other risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
a summary of the company s critical accounting policies follows allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
considerable judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the creditworthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods and may occur in the future due to the current market environment 
inventory reserve the company is required to state its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
the company has recorded changes in required reserves in recent periods due to impact of current and future technology trends and changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future due to the current market conditions 
restructuring accruals during the second and third quarters of  the company initiated certain restructuring plans 
in conjunction with these restructuring plans  the company established a restructuring reserve account for the estimated costs related to the plans 
these costs primarily related to facilities closings  severance costs and messageclick asp service exiting costs 
for the facilities closings cost a reserve was established for all remaining lease payments due on buildings and equipment that were no longer being utilized in continuing operations  less assumptions for sub leases 
the accrual for one lease with total payments remaining of million  assumes that the building will be sub leased for of the lease value 
as of december   the company had a remaining reserve balance of approximately million  which is included in current liabilities of discontinued operations 
the company believes that this remaining estimated balance is appropriate to cover future obligations associated with the restructurings 
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired during  the company acquired nact and telemate 
net see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the acquisitions  the company was required to estimate the fair value of assets including goodwill and other intangibles and liabilities acquired based on industry conditions  historical experience and future operational cash flow projections  option valuation models and evaluation of events subsequent to the acquisitions 
the company believes that the estimated purchased balances approximate fair market value 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessment 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is principally dependant upon achievement of future taxable income 
the company s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to market conditions  its ability to continue to successfully execute its strategic plan and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to recognize the entire tax benefit  the company established an offsetting provision for the tax benefit recorded 
litigation and related contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as  potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue based upon the then current facts and circumstances 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
intangible assets the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the company assesses the recoverability of its intangible assets by determining whether the value of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets over their remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which stipulates an impairment test is to be performed at each reporting date that requires a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
liquidity and capital resources summary liquidity is the measurement of the company s ability to have adequate cash or access to cash at all times in order to meet financial obligations when due  as well as to fund corporate expansion and other activities

at december   the company had no borrowings under its million credit facility with silicon valley bank the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company

sources of cash for  the company expects that its primary sources of cash will be from cash on hand  working capital provided by operating activities  borrowings under the credit agreement and other possible sources  including issuances of equity or debt securities 
the company believes that  with its current operations  which were cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of  and with the restructuring of the deferred amount  it will have sufficient liquidity from these sources to meet its current financial obligations through however  the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants and limitations on the company s ability to access funds under the credit agreement 
if the company is in violation of the credit agreement  or does not have sufficient eligible accounts receivable and inventory to support the level of borrowings it may need  the company may be unable to draw on the credit agreement to the extent necessary 
to the extent the company does not have borrowing availability under the credit agreement  the company may be required to obtain additional sources of capital  sell assets  obtain an amendment to the credit agreement or otherwise restructure its outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  as noted above  the watp settlement agreement is subject to bankruptcy court approval  and  if the bankruptcy court does not grant such approval by may   then the company will be required to pay to watp the remainder of the deferred amount totaling approximately million

net severances and discontinued operations in the company s long term cash needs are related to the costs of growing its current business as well as prospective businesses to be acquired  including capital expenditures and working capital  and funding the deferred payment for the purchase of nact 
the company expects to meet these cash needs through cash from operations  if any  cash on hand  borrowings under the credit agreement or other debt facilities  if available  as well as through possible issuances of equity or debt securities

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information included in this annual report 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  then our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we may be unable to fund future growth 
our business strategy calls for growth internally as well as through acquisitions 
this growth will require funding for additional personnel  capital expenditures and other expenses  as well as for working capital purposes 
financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  then we may not be able to meet our business objectives for expansion 
this in turn could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  then the percentage of ownership of our existing shareholders will be reduced  and any new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
furthermore  if we raise capital or acquire businesses by incurring indebtedness  then we will become subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including interest rate fluctuations and any financial or other covenants that our lender may require 
we may not become profitable 
we have a history of net losses  including net losses of approximately million for the fiscal year  for the fiscal year and for the fiscal year 
as of december   we had accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our revenues may not grow and we may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
the price of our common stock has been volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  has recently experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
during the year ended december   the per share closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market fluctuated from a high of to a low of  and from january  to march   the per share closing price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
we believe that the volatility of the price of our common stock does not necessarily relate to our performance and is broadly consistent with volatility experienced in our industry 
fluctuations may occur  among other reasons  in response to operating results  announcements by competitors  regulatory changes  economic changes  market valuation of technology firms  and general market conditions 
additionally  our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price our common stock to decline 
the trading price of our common stock could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to these or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if the market price of our common stock decreases  then shareholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock at a profit 
a low price for our common stock could result in its delisting from the nasdaq national market 
as noted above  our common stock is currently quoted on the nasdaq national market 
we must satisfy nasdaq s minimum listing maintenance requirements to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market 
nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements include a series of financial tests relating to shareholders equity  public float  number of market makers and shareholders  market capitalization  and maintaining a minimum bid price of per share for shares of our common stock 
the minimum bid price of our common stock has been less than per share at various times during the year ended december  if the bid price of our common stock falls below for a period that exceeds that allowed by the nasdaq national market  or if we are unable to continue to meet nasdaq s standards for any reason  then our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  then it would trade on either the nasdaq smallcap market or on the over the counter bulletin board  both of which are viewed by most investors as less desirable and less liquid marketplaces 
thus  delisting from the nasdaq national market could make trading our shares more difficult for investors  leading to declines in share price 
it would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital and execute our acquisition strategy 
in addition  we would incur additional costs under state blue sky laws to sell equity 
historically low trading volume in our common stock may affect shareholder liquidity 
the trading volume of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been low historically 
as of march   there were approximately million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding  however  there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our common stock 
low trading volume may result in shareholders being unable to sell shares of our common stock at the times and at the prices they desire 
we are exposed to the general condition of the telecommunications market 
our business is subject to global economic conditions  and in particular  market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
our operations could be adversely affected if declines in capital spending from telecommunications service providers continue 
if global economic conditions worsen  or if there is a prolonged slowdown in the telecommunications industry  then we may experience adverse operating results 
the market for next generation communications solutions is new and evolving and  if this market does not develop as we expect  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe there is a significant growth opportunity in providing next generation communications solutions to communications service providers  there can be no assurances that this technology will be widely accepted or that a viable market for our products will fully develop or be sustainable 
if this market does not develop  or develops more slowly than we expect  then we may not be able to sell our products in significant volume  or at all 
further  we believe that  with our acquisition of nact in july  we are now positioned to succeed in leveraging this opportunity based on our core competencies in developing solutions for communication service providers 
however  because of the intense competition in the market and the recent introduction of this technology  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in this evolving marketplace 
although we intend to penetrate a niche market within the network convergence technologies sector  we may be unsuccessful in competing against larger competitors in the market who have greater financial  operating and human resources and possess greater experience in this marketplace than we do 
our success will depend  in part  on our deployment of our voip product 
we believe that our voip product has significant revenue potential 
we have successfully completed beta trials of our voip product  but delays in its general availability or lack of acceptance in the marketplace after its widespread deployment could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
intellectual property infringement claims against us  even without merit  could require us to enter into costly licenses or deprive us of the technology we need 
our industry is technology intensive 
as the number of competitors in our target markets increases and the functionality of the products produced by such competitors further overlap  third parties may claim that the technology we develop or license infringes their proprietary rights 
any claims against us or any of our subsidiaries may affect our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
any infringement claims  even without merit  could require us to pay damages or settlement amounts or could require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements to avoid service implementation delays 
any litigation or potential litigation could result in product delays  increased costs or both 
in addition  the cost of litigation and the resulting distraction of our management resources could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if successful  a claim of product infringement could deprive us of the technology we need altogether 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends in part upon the protection of our proprietary application software and hardware products 
we have taken steps that we believe are adequate to establish  protect and enforce our intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights will be adequate 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise to use our products or technology 
we have pending several patent applications related to our voip product 
there can be no assurance that these patents will be issued 
even if these patents are issued  the limited legal protection afforded by patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights to the voip product 
furthermore  the laws of many foreign countries in which we do business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the united states 
although we have implemented and will continue to implement protective measures in those countries  these efforts may not be successful 
additionally  even if our us and international efforts are successful  our competitors may independently develop non infringing technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our technologies 
if our products contain defects  then our sales are likely to suffer and we may be exposed to legal claims 
our business strategy calls for the development of new products and product enhancements which may from time to time contain defects or result in failures that we did not detect or anticipate when introducing such products or enhancements to the market 
in addition  the markets in which our products are used are characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations and by errors  failures and bugs in third party platforms that can impede proper operation of our products
