item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hibbett sporting goods  inc we or hibbett is a rapidly growing operator of full line sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets predominantly in the southeastern united states 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel at competitive prices with superior customer service 
our merchandise assortment features a broad selection of brand name merchandise emphasizing team and individual sports complemented by a selection of localized apparel and accessories designed to appeal to a wide range of customers within each market 
our management team believes that our stores are among the primary retail distribution alternatives for brand name vendors that seek to reach our target markets 
as of february  we operated hibbett sports stores as well as sixteen smaller format sports additions athletic shoe stores and four larger format sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports a  square foot store located in enclosed malls and dominant strip centers 
we target markets with county populations that range from  to  by targeting smaller markets  we believe that we achieve significant strategic advantages  including numerous expansion opportunities  comparatively low operating costs and a more limited competitive environment than generally faced in larger markets 
in addition  we establish greater customer and vendor recognition as the leading full line sporting goods retailer in these local communities 
although competitors in some markets may carry similar product lines and national brands  we believe that the hibbett sports stores are typically the primary  full line sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of traditional team and individual sports merchandise offered and a high level of customer service 
in fiscal  we accelerated our rate of new store openings to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our target markets 
since fiscal  we have grown our store base from to stores 
our expansion strategy is to continue to open hibbett sports stores in our target markets 
we plan to open approximately hibbett sports stores in fiscal hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended february  and january   include weeks of operations  while the fiscal year ended february   includes weeks of operations 
hibbett is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
critical accounting policies inventory valuation 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method 
in using this method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns may  under certain circumstances  result in differing cost figures 
inaccurate inventory cost may be caused by applying the retail inventory to a group of products that have differing characteristics related to gross margin and turnover 
the company s accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
store physical inventory counts are taken on a cyclical basis and the distribution center physical inventory count is taken at the end of december or in early january each year 
management believes that the application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
accrued expenses 
on a monthly basis  certain material expenses are estimated in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
the most material estimate relates to payroll related expenses  insurance related expenses and certain store level operating expenses  such as property taxes and utilities 
the company s expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical results 
differences in management s estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated accrual

net interest expense for the weeks ended february   was  compared to  in the prior year period 
the increase is attributable to higher levels of borrowing on the company s revolving credit facilities in the current fiscal year to fund working capital requirements and new store growth 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities has historically been driven by net income levels combined with fluctuations in inventory and accounts payable balances 
net income has increased in each of the last three fiscal years 
in addition  we have continued to increase our inventory levels throughout these periods as the number of stores has increased 
these inventory increases were primarily financed with cash from operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
these activities resulted in cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
with respect to cash flows from investing activities  capital expenditures for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal resulted primarily from the opening of new hibbett sports stores  certain store remodels  and office and distribution center expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal included million for construction and equipment costs for the warehouse expansion 
the company estimates capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately million which will fund the opening of approximately hibbett sports stores  remodel selected existing stores  and fund headquarters and distribution center related capital expenditures 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities have historically represented the company s financing of its long term growth 
in fiscal  the company received million  excluding the related tax benefit  from proceeds related to stock options exercised and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
hibbett maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility  which will expire november  and allows borrowings up to million 
we also maintain an unsecured working capital line of credit for million which is subject to annual renewal 
as of february   we had million outstanding under these facilities 
based on our current operating and store opening plans  management believes that we can adequately fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future through borrowings under the credit facility  the working capital line of credit and cash generated from operations

quarterly fluctuations the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and operating income 
the company s net sales and operating income are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales increases during the holiday selling season 
however  the seasonal fluctuations are mitigated by the strong product demand in the spring  summer  back to school and holiday sales periods 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores  the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  merchandise mix  the relative proportion of stores represented by each of the company s three store concepts and demand for apparel and accessories driven by local interest in sporting events
