the license of our software products is typically an executive level decision by prospective end users and generally requires our sales staff and our aps to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle typically between six and twelve months from the initial contact date 
we distribute our products through a direct sales force and a network of aps 
for  approximately of our license revenues were derived from our aps and the remaining license fees were derived from direct sales 
however  no individual customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we generated approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues from international sales 
our revenues consist primarily of license revenues  which are comprised of one time fees for the license of our products  service revenues  and maintenance revenues  which are comprised of fees for upgrades and technical support 
our aps  which are responsible for the installation and integration of the software for their customers  enter into sales agreements with the end user  and license software directly from us 
we license software directly to the end user through software license agreements 
annual maintenance agreements are also entered into between the aps and the end user  and the aps then purchase maintenance services directly from us

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to income taxes  bad debts  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  forecasts and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn our revenue primarily from licenses and fees 
our revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  as amended by statement of position for sales made either through our aps or by us  we generally recognize license revenue upon shipment when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed or a purchase order has been received  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the license fees are not assumed to be fixed or determinable if the fees are due more than months after delivery or are based on achievement of a milestone 
where applicable  fees from multiple element arrangements are unbundled and recorded as revenue as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for the various elements 
we establish vsoe of fair value on maintenance and professional services elements based on prices charged when the same elements are sold in separate transactions 
we have not established vsoe on license elements 
revenue on undelivered and delivered elements is recorded using the residual method in accordance with sop  as amended 
software maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally one year 
the unrecognized portion of software maintenance revenues is recorded in the accompanying balance sheets as deferred revenue 
other revenues are recognized as services are performed 
we generally do not grant rights to return products  except for defects in the performance of the products relative to specifications and pursuant to standard industry shrink wrapped license agreements which provide for day rights of return if an end user does not accept the terms of the shrink wrapped license agreements 
the day right of return begins upon product shipment 
our software license agreements generally do not provide price adjustments or rotation rights 
we generally include a day limited warranty with the software license  which entitles the end user to corrections for documented program errors 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe it is more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
accounting for preferred stock in we completed the sale of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock  and warrants the warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to an investor group consisting principally of thomas weisel capital partners and affiliated entities twcp for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the preferred stock could have been redeemed if  after one year  our common stock traded above a specified price level for a period of time 
until then  it accrued a cumulative dividend of eight percent per annum 
the preferred stock was subject to mandatory redemption provisions on the eighth anniversary of the issuance for cash equal to the stated liquidation preference plus accumulated unpaid dividends 
the preferred stock was convertible to common stock at the holder s option based upon the conversion formula as defined in the preferred stock certificate of designation 
we also assumed an obligation to register the shares of its common stock underlying the preferred stock and the warrants 
the million in gross proceeds received was allocated between the preferred stock  the beneficial conversion feature  and the warrants based on the respective fair values of each instrument  or approximately million for the preferred stock  approximately million for the beneficial conversion feature  and approximately million for the warrants 
the initial carrying amount of the preferred stock was increased by periodic accretions so that the carrying amount would have been equal to the redemption amount million at the redemption date in the periodic increases in carrying amount were effected by charges against additional paid in capital 
the value of the beneficial conversion feature was determined by calculating the fair market value of the underlying common stock less the intrinsic value of the preferred stock based on the allocation of proceeds 
as the preferred stock was convertible into common stock at any time  the beneficial conversion amount was accreted in its entirety at the date of issuance of the preferred stock 
in connection with the above preferred stock transaction  warrants were issued to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were to expire in and as of may  no warrants were exercised 
the fair value of the warrants was determined to be  at the date of issuance and was separately recorded as warrants for the purchase of the company s common stock and as a reduction to the series a convertible preferred stock 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated on the date of issuance using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions  expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  and contractual life of years 
on may   thomas weisel capital partners lp  a delaware limited partnership  certain of its affiliates and rkb capital  lp the purchasers and us entered into an exchange agreement  pursuant to which we have issued series a convertible preferred stock the series a preferred  having the terms and provisions set forth in the certificate of designation designating the series a convertible preferred stock  on a one for one basis  in return for the exchange  surrender and cancellation of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock the series a preferred 
the series a preferred issued in exchange for the series a preferred is substantially identical to the series a preferred with the exception of certain changes made to the redemption  dividend  protective and liquidation provisions thereof 
in connection with this transaction  we also purchased the warrants associated with the series a preferred for an aggregate of 
the series a preferred is convertible to common stock at the holders option based upon the conversion formula as defined in the certificate of designation 
the series a preferred was recorded in stockholders equity at its fair value 
the difference between the carrying value of the series a preferred at the time of the exchange and the fair value of the series a preferred of million as determined by an independent valuation was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital and as a one time adjustment to net income loss applicable to common stockholders 
as a result of the exchange agreement  future periods will not have adjustments to income for accumulating dividends or allocations of the discounts associated with the series a preferred stock 
accounting for restructuring activities during february  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
this reduction in force resulted in approximately million of restructuring charges to earnings in the first quarter of  primarily to cover severance and severance related costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  we had million in short term investments that are sensitive to market risks 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
we do not own any derivative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio we are primarily subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments that are primarily united states government and agency bonds of duration ranging from one to five years 
the market value of these bonds is subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from december   would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
although the market value of these short term investments would change due to the interest rate fluctuation  we have the ability to hold the investments to maturity  which would reduce overall market risk
