item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we provide ultrahigh pressure uhp systems and related products and services to a wide variety of industries 
waterjet cutting is recognized as a better alternative to traditional cutting methods such as lasers  saws or plasma 
it is faster  has greater versatility in the types of products it can cut and eliminates the need for secondary processing operations 
we presently divide our revenues according to our identified segments uhp systems and fresher under pressure 
for analytical purposes  our uhp systems are further broken down into systems and consumable parts and services 
consolidated revenues by segment year ended april  in thousands uhp systems systems    consumable parts and services    fresher under pressure food systems    total revenues    fiscal compared to fiscal our total revenues for the year ended april  were million  a decrease of million over the prior year period 
fresher under pressure food technology revenues totaled million  a million decrease from fiscal revenues of million 
excluding fresher under pressure  revenues decreased million  due to a decline in domestic revenues  impacted by the tightening economy which was further exacerbated by the events of september th 
this decline was offset in part by a million growth in international sales 
both domestic and international sales include the patented wire wound isostatic and flexform presses general press 
general press revenues increased million to million in fiscal excluding general press revenues  as well as fresher under pressure  fiscal domestic sales decreased as compared to the overall united states machine cutting tool market which declined for the year ended march   according to the association for manufacturing technology amt 
consistent with historical performance  waterjet technology continues to gain market share due to its advantages over traditional cutting technologies  even in a down market 
these advantages  as well as continued product development  should allow us to continue to gain market share  however  growth will be affected by the performance of the broader machine tool market 
our revenues are segregated according to our currently identified segments uhp systems and fresher under pressure 
our uhp systems are further comprised of system sales and consumable parts and services sales 
systems are generally comprised of a pump along with the robotics or articulation used to move the cutting or cleaning head 
systems are further broken down between standard cutting systems  standard automotive systems  and special or custom designed systems used primarily in the aerospace and automotive markets  as well as general press systems 
systems sales in fiscal were million  a decrease of million over the prior year resulting from the soft economic conditions which have slowed capital spending decisions 
consumables are primarily parts used by the pump and cutting head during operation 
consumable parts and services revenues decreased million to million in fiscal the slowdown in the consumable sales growth reflects a decrease of machine utilization in the worldwide machine tool market  as well as success of our goal of providing lower operating costs through longer life parts 
fiscal revenues included million related to food technology or fresher under pressure  a decrease from the fiscal total of million 
this decline from fiscal revenues of million is the result of a reorganization of the business  including a comprehensive product evaluation and a program to focus on specific markets within the food industry  as well as from purchasing decisions being placed on hold after the events of september th 
our uhp technology exposes foods to pressures from  to over  psi for a short period of time  typically seconds to several minutes 
this process reduces food borne pathogens such as camplyobacter  e 
coli  listeria monocytogenes  salmonella and vibro vulnificus 
uhp achieves the effects of pasteurization on packaged foods  offering the greatest level of food safety with minimal effects on the nutrition  taste  texture  or color of food  while also extending shelf life 
we can uhp process both pumpable and non pumpable foods 
for pumpable foods  we utilize a technology which features a continuous flow concept whereby pumpable foods such as juice  salsas  guacamole  liquid eggs and salad dressings are pumped into the pressure chambers  pressurized and then pumped into the next stage of the process  such as bottling 
this continuous flow process is fully automated and requires just a single operator 
for non pumpable foods  such as meats  seafood  vegetables and fruits  we utilize our patented large wire wound pressure vessel batch technology 
this makes us the only supplier of complete uhp systems to the food industry 
we anticipate selling and leasing the continuous flow systems and selling the batch systems 
the leases have a fixed monthly charge plus a per gallon or per pound usage fee 
lease revenue is recognized monthly based on throughput 
revenue for the batch systems is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
our european revenues of million increased million compared to the prior year and represented of fiscal consolidated revenue 
this increase was spurred by a growth in general press sales of million offset by declining revenues in european shapecutting sales of million resulting from the economic softness in the european market 
sales in the remainder of the world  primarily asia  canada  mexico and south america  decreased to million  the result of weak global economic conditions 
we typically sell our products at higher prices outside the united states due to the costs of servicing these markets 
gross profit for the year ended april  decreased million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in general  gross margin rates on our systems sales are less than as opposed to consumables sales which are in excess of 
on average  standard systems carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems  which include general presses 
as such  the gross margin percentage varies depending on the revenue mix between systems  both standard and special  and consumables sales 
systems sales  including fresher under pressure  represented of fiscal revenues  flat from the prior year  and consumables sales represented of fiscal revenues consistent with the prior year 
the slight decrease in current year gross margin was a function of the increase  as a percentage of total revenues  of general press systems  as compared to standard systems sales 
operating expenses decreased million as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  total operating expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal marketing expenses of million decreased million as compared to the prior year  but expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased to from in the prior year 
the current year expense decrease results from the lower commission expense associated with lower revenue levels as well as lower trade show expenses  having not incurred imts trade show expenses in fiscal as the show is held every other year 
research and engineering expenses in fiscal decreased million to million as compared to the prior year due to a global realignment of resources 
as a percentage of revenues  research and engineering expenses were in fiscal which is comparable to fiscal our management will continue to pursue technological advances through focused research and engineering spending to maintain our technological superiority 
general and administrative expenses of million decreased million for the year as compared to the prior year 
a portion of the decrease stems for worldwide staffing reductions as we continue to realign our resources while the remaining million of the decrease stems from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  in may  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
expressed as a percentage of revenues however  general and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year at 
another component of fas requires that we conduct a periodic evaluation of the carrying value of our goodwill balances 
from this review  we identified and expensed million of asset impairment in our automotive divisions which have been highly impacted from recent economic events 
this amount is reflected in the impairment of goodwill caption on our consolidated statement of operations 
operating income can vary significantly for domestic and foreign operations  but is primarily the result of product mix variations and volume from year to year 
the domestic machine tool market extended its weakness into fiscal and the us dollar continued to gain strength over the european currencies 
net interest expense of million increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to higher average debt levels associated with the additional financing related to the development of the fresher under pressure program  as well as higher weighted average cost of capital year over year 
average debt outstanding increased million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this increase in debt was solely related to funding the fresher under pressure technology s operating loss 
during fiscal  other expense  net  totaled million compared to other expense  net  of  in fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of the write down of two investments to their market value at april  which amounted to million 
the fiscal income tax benefit was computed using a rate of as compared to in the previous year 
the current year tax rate is a blended rate of the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in fiscal  the income tax rate was lower than the statutory rates primarily due to lower foreign tax rates and benefits from the foreign sales corporation 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of utilizing our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance thereon based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence related to these deferred tax assets 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss earnings per share is  for fiscal and  and  respectively  for fiscal the effect of the adoption of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  during fiscal is shown as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
included in the consolidated results of operations is the performance of the fresher under pressure technology  and the performance of the non food business  cutting  cleaning and isostatic presses 
we have used estimates to determine the allocable costs of the consolidated operations to the fresher under pressure results of operations 
based on these estimates  fresher under pressure lost million or 
per share in fiscal and the waterjet operations generated net income of million or 
per share 
on a consolidated basis  we recorded fiscal net loss of million  or 
basic and diluted loss per share as compared to million  or 
basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the year ended april  were million  an increase of million over the prior year period 
fresher under pressure food safety revenues totaled million  a doubling of the fiscal fresher under pressure revenues of million 
excluding fresher under pressure  revenues increased million  which was comprised of a growth in domestic revenues  offset in part by a decline in international sales 
excluding general press revenues  as well as fresher under pressure  domestic sales increased as compared to the overall united states machine cutting tool market which declined for the months ended march   according to the association for manufacturing technology amt 
consistent with historical performance  waterjet technology continues to gain market share due to its advantages over traditional cutting technologies  even in a down market 
our worldwide general press business decreased million to million 
however  the current fiscal year total is more reflective of a normal business level as the prior year included a million ford press  the single largest press ever sold 
during fiscal the company adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
under sab  revenue recognition is delayed until after installation of the company s standard uhp systems 
prior to sab adoption  the company recognized revenue for standard systems upon shipment 
standard systems sales represent approximately one third of the company s consolidated revenues 
the remaining consolidated revenue represents either consumable parts sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  or special systems for which revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the impact of the sab adoption as described in note to the consolidated financial statements was not significant to consolidated current year revenues 
systems sales in fiscal were million  an increase of million over the prior year 
excluding general presses  systems revenues increased million 
consumable parts and services revenues decreased million to million in fiscal european revenues of million decreased million compared to the prior year and represented of fiscal revenues 
the majority of this decrease  million  represents a decline in sales of general presses 
the remainder of the decrease was exchange rate related as the euro continued to weaken against the us dollar during the year 
asian revenues increased to million and accounted for of consolidated revenues 
sales in the remainder of the world  primarily canada  mexico and south america  decreased to million 
gross profit for the year ended april  increased million 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the prior year includes a million charge associated with a pressure systems loss contract 
excluding this impact  the gross margin percent in fiscal was 
the gross margin percentage varies depending on the revenue mix between systems  both standard and special  and consumables sales 
systems sales  including fresher under pressure  represented of fiscal revenues  up from in the prior year  and consumables sales represented of fiscal revenues  down from in the prior year 
the increase in current year gross margin was a function of the shift in revenue towards a greater percentage of standard system sales  as general press systems revenues decreased 
operating expenses increased million as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  total operating expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal marketing expenses of million increased million as compared to the prior year  and expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased to from in the prior year 
the current year increase includes expenses associated with additional fresher under pressure marketing activity  as well as the imts trade show 
research and engineering expenses in fiscal increased million to million as compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues  research and engineering expenses were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal approximately one half of this increase is continued development of the fresher under pressure technology and the other half is advancement of the waterjet cutting technology 
general and administrative expenses of million increased  for the year as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues however  general and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year at 
operating income is subject to product mix variations and volume from year to year 
it can experience significant changes for domestic and foreign operations 
in fiscal operating income began to reflect the effects of the weakening domestic machine tool market thus yielding lower results than in the prior year same period 
net interest expense of million increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to higher average debt levels associated with the additional financing related to the development of the fresher under pressure program 
average debt outstanding increased million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this increase in debt was solely related to funding the fresher under pressure technology  from both asset additions as well as its operating loss 
during fiscal  other expense  net  totaled  compared to other expense  net  of million in fiscal this reduction is due in part to the decrease in the minority interest for majority owned joint ventures 
fiscal income tax expense was of income before tax as compared to in the previous year 
the income tax rates were lower than the statutory rates in both the current and prior year due primarily to lower foreign tax rates and benefits from the foreign sales corporation 
additionally  the company regularly evaluates the likelihood of utilizing its deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowance thereon based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence related to these deferred tax assets 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is  and  respectively  for fiscal and  and  respectively  for fiscal the effect of the adoption of sab during fiscal is shown as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
included in the consolidated results of operations is the performance of the fresher under pressure technology  and the performance of the non food business  cutting  cleaning and isostatic presses 
management has used estimates to determine the allocable costs of the consolidated operations to the fresher under pressure results of operations 
based on these estimates  fresher under pressure lost million or 
per share in fiscal and the non food operations generated net income of million or 
per share 
on a consolidated basis  the company recorded fiscal net income of million  or 
basic and 
diluted earnings per share as compared to million  or 
basic and 
diluted earnings per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to using million in fiscal the increased focus on receivables and inventory management allowed us to convert these assets into cash during the year 
at april   we had million in inventory and fixed assets associated with fresher under pressure  compared to million last year  a decrease of million 
total debt at april  was million  a decrease of million from april  on may   we signed and funded a million subordinated debt agreement with the john hancock life insurance company hancock 
the agreement requires semi annual interest only payments of and two equal principal payments due on april  and april  in addition  we issued to hancock warrants for  shares of our common stock exercisable at 
per share 
we used the proceeds of the debt to pay down part of the existing senior debt  increase our borrowing capacity and continue to expand our product and marketing programs for fresher under pressure 
this financing is subordinated debt  which typically carries a higher rate of interest 
we do not consider this higher cost of funds to be a trend  nor do we expect to incur any changes to the cost of capital due to this transaction 
we believe that the available credit facilities and working capital generated by operations will provide sufficient resources to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next months 
our credit agreement and private placement require us to comply with certain financial covenants 
the covenants were amended as of april  to respond to the weakening economic conditions 
we are in compliance with all covenants  as amended 
the company has been able to satisfy its needs for working capital and capital expenditures  due in part to its ability to access adequate financing arrangements 
the company expects that operations will continue  with the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
compliance with future debt covenants requires the company to meet its operating projections  which include achieving certain revenues and consistent operating margins 
if the company is unable to comply with the amended debt covenants  and the company s lenders are unwilling to waive or amend the debt covenants  certain components of the company s long term obligations and notes payable would become current  and the company would be required to seek alternative financing 
alternative sources of financing may not be available if required or  if available  may not be on terms satisfactory to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain alternative financing on satisfactory terms  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  and the company may be required to curtail capital spending  further reduce expenses and otherwise modify its planned operations 
payments due by period less than year years years after years total long term debt and notes payable     operating leases     total contractual cash obligations    long term debt obligations  notes payable and lease commitments are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other borrowings 
our capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million to million in fiscal it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally and through available credit facilities 
gross receivables of million at april  decreased  from april  trade receivables decreased million due to collection of several large receivables which was offset by an increase of million in unbilled receivables from several non standard and food systems  which have lead times from six to months 
additionally  longer payment terms are sometimes negotiated on large system orders 
we do not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on our short term liquidity requirements 
inventory of million at april  represents a decrease of million compared to april  included in these totals is a decrease in work in process of million  with the majority of this decrease related to fresher under pressure production 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all of four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on our judgments regarding the collectibility of those amounts 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine this criterion is not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
for non standard and long lead time systems  including the fresher under pressure technology  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the cost to cost method  measuring the costs incurred on a project at a specified date  as compared to the estimated total cost of the project 
revenues from equipment on lease are recognized as rental income in the period earned 
shipping revenues and expenses are recorded in revenue and costs of goods sold  respectively 
product warranty reserve our products are generally covered by a warranty for up to months 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of accounts receivable we use estimates in determining our allowance for bad debts that are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs of our receivables and we have a low experience of write offs 
additionally  we also review current trends in the credit quality of our customers  as well as changes in our internal credit policies 
valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently record a reserve for obsolete or excess inventory for parts and equipment that is no longer used due to engineering and design changes to our products 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels 
if we do not deplete the inventory through normal or expected usage  we may record a reserve for any expected obsolete or excess inventory 
if this estimate for obsolete or excess inventory is understated  operating income would be reduced 
impairment of goodwill we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance of our operating and acquired businesses  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with these businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective beginning may  fas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure them at fair value 
we adopted fas without a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets states that goodwill should not be amortized  but rather periodically analyzed using an impairment only approach 
upon our early adoption of fas on may   an initial evaluation of goodwill impairment was performed  and no impairment charges were taken 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took a million impairment charge commensurate with the continued depression of the automotive sector which decreased the implied fair value of certain of our divisions 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations provides accounting and reporting standards for recognizing obligations related to asset retirement costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
we will be required to adopt this statement no later than may  we expect to adopt this statement in fiscal without a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  is required to be adopted as of may  fas governs the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
we expect to adopt this statement in fiscal without a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  rescission of fas nos 
  and  amendment of fas  and technical corrections as of april makes certain technical corrections and supersedes other technical guidance 
certain provisions are required to be adopted immediately  while other provisions are effective for transactions occurring after may  we do not expect adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for exit or disposal activities addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in our financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to our daily operations 
interest rate exposure at april   we had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount  million was fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
the remaining debt of million was variable with million of this total bearing a rate of libor or at april  the majority of the remaining floating rate debt was at prime  or 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on our debt obligations 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to our pretax profits and cash flow of  at april   we had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
we had none in effect at april  foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish crown 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  with functional currencies other than the us dollar  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the determination of net income have not been material 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at april   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
at april   we had several forward exchange contracts to offset the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we may continue to use derivative instruments  such as forward exchange rate contracts  to manage the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
management s statement of responsibility management is responsible for the fair and accurate presentation of information in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
financial and operating information comes from company records and other sources 
certain amounts are  of necessity  based on judgment and estimation 
we believe that adequate accounting systems and financial controls are maintained to ensure that the company s records are free from material misstatement and to protect the company s assets from loss or unauthorized use 
in addition  the audit committee of the board of directors periodically meets with pricewaterhousecoopers llp  the company s independent accountants  and management to review the work of each  to discuss financial reporting matters  and to review auditing and internal control procedures
