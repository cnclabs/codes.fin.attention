item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview through its subsidiaries and joint venture arrangements  the company furnishes offshore support services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry and provides contractual oil spill response and professional services to those who store  transport  produce or handle petroleum and certain non petroleum oils 
the company s offshore support vessels operate principally in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea  latin america  west africa and asia and its oil spill and professional services are primarily provided in the us the company s business is primarily comprised of two segments  offshore marine services and environmental services 
upon completion of the september  initial public offering of the common stock of chiles offshore  the company s drilling service business segment  the company s ownership interest in chiles offshore declined below and the company began accounting for its interest in chiles offshore under the equity method 
as a result  the company no longer accounts for its investment in chiles offshore as a segment 
offshore marine service segment the company s offshore marine service segment provides marine transportation  logistics and related services primarily dedicated to supporting oil and gas exploration and production 
the offshore marine service segment s operating revenues are primarily affected by the number of vessels owned and bareboat and time chartered in  as well as rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet 
overall utilization for any vessel with respect to any period is the ratio of aggregate number of days worked by such vessel to total calendar days available during such period 
the rate per day worked for any vessel with respect to any period is the ratio of total time charter revenue of such vessel to the aggregate number of days worked by such vessel for such period 
the company has expanded its fleet from vessels at january  to vessels at december  during the year ended december   the company acquired or chartered in vessels and disposed or terminated the charter in of vessels 
ten vessels were sold and leased back in since  the company has deposited proceeds from the sale of certain vessels into restricted cash accounts for purposes of acquiring newly constructed us flag vessels and qualifying for the company s temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from the sale of those vessels 
rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet are a function of demand for and availability of marine vessels  which is closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices which  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked and utilization data for the company s fleet during the periods indicated 
year ended december  fleet rates per day worked anchor handling towing supply    crew    geophysical  freight and other    mini supply    standby safety    supply and towing supply    utility    overall fleet    year ended december  fleet overall utilization anchor handling towing supply crew geophysical  freight and other mini supply standby safety supply and towing supply utility overall fleet rates per day worked and overall utilization figures exclude owned vessels that are bareboat chartered out  vessels owned by corporations that participate in pooling arrangements with the company  joint venture vessels and managed vessels and include vessels bareboat and time chartered in by the company 
revenues for certain of the company s vessels  primarily its north sea fleet  are earned in foreign currencies  primarily pounds sterling  and have been converted to us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the periods indicated 
the company earns operating revenues primarily from the time or bareboat charter out of vessels  which are owned or bareboat or time chartered in 
at december   the company had vessels bareboat chartered out  including vessels operated by the company s joint ventures 
at various times  the company provides management services to other vessel owners 
charter revenues and vessel expenses of those managed vessels are not generally included in operating results  but the company does recognize a management fee in operating revenues 
the table below sets forth the company s fleet structure at the dates indicated 
at december  fleet structure domestic owned bareboat and time chartered in managed joint ventures and pools foreign owned bareboat and time chartered in managed joint ventures and pools total fleet see item business joint ventures and pooling arrangements 
vessel operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant vessel operating expense items are wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
in addition to variable vessel operating expenses  the offshore marine business segment incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of property and equipment and charter in hire 
depreciation is a significant operating expense and the amount related to vessels is the most significant component 
most vessels chartered in by the company resulted from sale and lease back transactions 
drydocking repairs  which are a substantial component of a vessel s maintenance costs  are expensed when incurred 
under applicable maritime regulations  vessels must be drydocked twice in a five year period for inspection by regulatory authorities 
the company follows an asset management strategy pursuant to which it defers required drydocking of selected vessels and voluntarily removes these vessels from operation during periods of weak market conditions and low rates per day worked 
should the company undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal year or put through survey a disproportionate number of older vessels  which typically have higher drydocking costs  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december   and  drydocking costs totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during those same periods  the company completed the drydocking of  and marine vessels  respectively 
a portion of the company s revenues and expenses  primarily related to its north sea operations  are received or paid in foreign currencies 
for financial statement reporting purposes  these amounts are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates during the relevant period 
the worldwide offshore rig count in decreased from the previous year due primarily to declining oil and natural gas prices 
there were approximately offshore mobile rigs in operation worldwide at year end  representing a decrease from the count at the prior year end 
us gulf of mexico drilling rig utilization fell from approximately offshore mobile rigs at the end of to approximately offshore mobile rigs at the end of  whereas  utilization of drilling rigs operating internationally actually improved from offshore mobile rigs working at the end of to offshore mobile rigs in service at the end of in response to high oil and gas commodity prices  drilling in the us gulf of mexico was very active in the first half of but began to decline mid year from the slowdown in the economy  a cool summer  fuel switching and then the tragedy of september the unusually warm winter of also contributed to the decrease in demand for offshore drilling and consequently the demand for the company s vessels in the us gulf of mexico 
throughout these same periods  international drilling activity remained steady  as did the utilization of the company s foreign fleet 
recently  natural gas and oil prices have begun to increase 
as a result  demand for the company s vessels may increase in response to more offshore drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico 
international activity has remained stable 
environmental service segment the company s environmental service segment provides contractual oil spill response and other related training and consulting services 
the company s clients include tank vessel owner operators  refiners and terminal operators  exploration and production facility operators and pipeline operators 
the company charges a retainer fee to its customers for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of its response services and equipment 
pursuant to retainer agreements entered into with the company  certain vessel owners pay in advance to the company an annual retainer fee based upon the number and size of vessels in each such owner s fleet and in some circumstances pay the company additional fees based upon the level of each vessel owner s voyage activity in the us the company recognizes the greater of revenue earned by voyage activity or the portion of the retainer earned in each accounting period 
certain vessel and facility owners pay a fixed fee or a fee based on volume of petroleum product transported for the company s retainer services and such fee is recognized ratably throughout the year 
the company s retainer agreements with vessel owners generally range from one to three years while retainer arrangements with facility owners are as long as ten years 
spill response revenue is dependent on the magnitude of any one spill response and the number of spill responses within a given fiscal period 
consequently  spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable periods and the revenue from any one period is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future periods 
costs of oil spill response activities relate primarily to i payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials  ii direct charges to the company for equipment and materials  iii participation interests of others in gross profits from oil spill response and iv training and exercises related to spill response preparedness 
the company charges consulting fees to customers for customized training programs  its planning of and participation in customer oil spill response drill programs and response exercises and other special projects 
the principal components of the company s operating costs are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to sub contractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer business 
other investments inland river operations the company s inland river business earns operating revenues primarily from voyage affreightments under which customers are charged for a committed space to transport cargo for a specific time from a point of origin to a destination at an established rate per ton 
revenues are also earned while cargo is stored aboard barges and when barges are chartered out to third parties 
barge operating expenses are typically differentiated between those directly related to voyages and all other barge operating costs 
voyage expenses primarily include towing  switching  fleeting and cleaning costs  whereas  non voyage related operating expenses include such costs as repairs  insurance and depreciation 
the company s directly owned barges and certain of those managed for third parties participate in two pooling arrangements 
pursuant to these pooling arrangements  operating revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and the net results are allocated to respective participating barge owners based upon the number of days any one participating owner s barges bear to the total number of days of all barges participating in the pool 
the company has contracts or commitments to build barges in investment in chiles offshore the company consolidated the reporting of financial information of drill rig operator chiles offshore  due to its majority ownership  from its inception in until its initial public offering of common stock the chiles ipo 
on september   chiles offshore completed the chiles ipo 
as a consequence of the chiles ipo  the company s ownership interest in chiles offshore was reduced from to  at which point the company ceased consolidating chiles offshore s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and began accounting for its interest in chiles offshore using the equity method 
at december   company s ownership percentage in chiles offshore was 
the decline in the company s ownership percentage since the chiles ipo was primarily the consequence of chiles offshore s issuance of additional shares upon its acquisition of all the share capital of an entity that owned an ultra premium jackup drilling rig 
chiles offshore derives its revenues primarily from contracts to drill wells for oil and gas operators 
in the us gulf of mexico  these drilling contracts are typically for terms of to days and provide for base dayrates  which may be subject to adjustments based on performance incentives 
in international operations  chiles offshore has entered into multi year drilling contracts 
for the twelve months ended december   chiles offshore s rig utilization was and the average dayrate was  in calculating average dayrates  chiles offshore divides the revenue earned by its rigs during the period by the total number of rig operating days in the period 
in addition  chiles offshore s average dayrates include any bonuses that may be triggered by achieving performance and safety targets in its drilling contracts 
both dayrates and utilization are a function of demand for  and availability of  drilling rigs  which are affected by short and long term trends in oil and gas prices  which are  in turn  related to the demand for petroleum products  the current availability of oil and gas resources and the general level of worldwide economic activity 
rig operating expense consists primarily of crew costs  insurance  inspections  repair and maintenance and other related costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate and safety management  administration  marketing  financial and legal expenses 
other activities the company  from time to time  makes investments in other related businesses

operating revenues generated by newly acquired  constructed and chartered in vessels exceeded the loss of revenues associated with vessel dispositions through sales and charter in terminations 
fleet growth over the past two years contributed approximately million toward higher operating revenues in versus vessel dispositions and charter in terminations over the past two years resulted in a decline in operating revenues between years of approximately million 
rising rates per day worked and utilization resulted in higher operating revenues between years of million and million  respectively 
rates per day worked rose for all vessel classes in all operating regions  excluding domestic geophysical  freight and other vessels 
rates per day worked particularly improved for the company s worldwide fleet of supply and towing supply vessels  us crew and utility vessels and foreign anchor handling towing supply vessels

comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year offshore marine service segment operating revenues 
the company s offshore marine service segment s operating revenues increased million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  operating revenues rose between years due primarily to the acquisition  construction and charter in of vessels and the consolidation of eli s financial results with those of the company 
a decline in operating revenues resulting from vessel sales and charter in expirations  an increase in the number of vessels bareboat chartered out and lower rates per day worked and utilization partially offset this increase 
the acquisition  construction and charter in of vessels resulted in a million increase in operating revenues 
this increase was offset by a million decline in operating revenues due to vessel sales and charter in expirations and an increase in the number of vessels bareboat chartered out 
as a result of eli becoming a majority owned subsidiary in december  the company began consolidating eli s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows with its own and operating revenues rose between years by million

this increase was partially offset by lower interest expense resulting primarily from reduced indebtedness following the deconsolidation of chiles offshore and the entry into swap agreements 
interest income declined also due to the chiles offshore deconsolidation and as a result of the exchange of certain notes receivable for equity holdings in globe wireless 
during the twelve months of and  the company capitalized interest of million and million  respectively  with respect to the construction of rigs for chiles offshore and vessels

liquidity and capital resources general the company s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from its need to service debt  fund working capital  acquire  construct or improve equipment and make other investments 
management believes that cash flow from operations will provide sufficient working capital to fund the company s operating needs for the foreseeable future 
the company may  from time to time  issue shares of common stock  preferred stock  debt or a combination thereof  or sell vessels to finance the acquisition of equipment and businesses or make improvements to existing equipment 
the company s cash flow levels and operating revenues will be determined primarily by the size of the company s offshore marine fleet  rates per day worked and overall utilization of the company s offshore marine vessels and retainer  spill response and consulting activities of the company s environmental service business 
the volatility of oil and gas prices  the level of offshore production and exploration activity and other factors beyond the company s control will directly affect the company s marine service business 
a decline in us gulf of mexico drilling activity during the second half of has lowered demand and rates per day worked for most classes of vessels in the company s us fleet 
as a result  operating revenues have declined  and at present  the company has us vessels out of service  including from its utility fleet 
oil and natural gas prices have recently improved  and should these prices remain stable or rise further over the next several months  drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico should also increase 
these improvements should in turn lead to higher utilization and rates per day worked for the company s domestic fleet 
the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent  market conditions will improve  remain stable or even deteriorate 
as a result  should present demand and rates per day worked for the company s us vessels remain unchanged or further decline  results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected

the company may make selective acquisitions of vessels or barges  fleets of vessels or barges  oil spill response equipment  or expand the scope and nature of its environmental and logistics services  or invest in businesses related to its existing operations 
the company also may upgrade or enhance its vessels or construct vessels to remain competitive in the marketplace 
management anticipates that such expenditures would be funded through a combination of existing cash balances  cash flow provided by operations  sale of existing equipment and  potentially  through the issuance of additional indebtedness or shares of common stock 
credit facilities and notes revolving credit facility 
on february   the company completed the syndication of a million  five year  non reducing  unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced a million unsecured reducing revolving credit facility  of which million was available for future borrowing upon termination 
advances under the new revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes 
interest on advances will be charged at a rate per annum of libor plus an applicable margin of to basis points based upon the company s credit rating as determined by standard poor s and moody s

the notes contain covenants including  among others  limitations on liens and sale and leasebacks of certain properties and restrictions on the company consolidating with or merging into any other person 
in order to reduce its cost of capital  the company entered into swap agreements during the fourth quarter of with a major financial institution with respect to notional amounts equal to a portion of its notes 
pursuant to each such agreement  such financial institution agreed to pay to the company an amount equal to interest paid on the notional amount of the notes subject to such agreement  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution an amount equal to interest currently at the rate of approximately per annum on the agreed upon price of such notional amount of the notes as set forth in the applicable swap agreement 
at december   million notional principal amount of the notes were covered by such swap agreements 
upon termination of each swap agreement  the financial institution agreed to pay to the company the amount  if any  by which the fair market value of the notional amount of the notes subject to the swap agreement on such date exceeded the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreement  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution the amount  if any  by which the agreed upon price of such notional amount exceeded the fair market value of such notional amount on such date 
the swap agreements terminate during the fourth quarter of unless extended by mutual consent

the call  together with certain privately negotiated transactions  resulted in the conversion of million principal amount of the notes into  shares of common stock and redemption of million principal amount of the notes for approximately million  including accrued interest  and at december   million aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding 
pursuant to an amended and restated standby purchase agreement between csfb and seacor  csfb was obligated  subject to several conditions  to purchase from seacor  at a purchase price of per share  the number of shares of common stock necessary to provide seacor with the proceeds to pay the aggregate total redemption price of up to million of the notes that seacor redeemed

globe wireless since inception in the early s  globe wireless has focused on expanding its network of high frequency radio stations and customers base 
to support its continued growth  globe wireless completed a private placement offering in that raised approximately million 
although globe wireless has experienced negative cash flow  the management of globe wireless presently believes the company will closely approximate cash break even by mid there can be no assurances that globe wireless s future operations will succeed 
should globe wireless be unable to meet its funding requirements  seacor would be required to commit additional funding or record an impairment charge with respect to its investment

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  the company is required to make estimates  judgements and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
the company bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
revenue recognition 
operating revenues are earned primarily from the offshore marine service segment s time and bareboat charter out of vessels and the environmental service segment s charge for retainer fees 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been delivered  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and when other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
purchase accounting and goodwill 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgement to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of each acquired operation is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when  and if  information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed beyond one year from the date of the acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted 
should information become available after the allocation period  those items are included in operating results 
the cost of an enterprise acquired in a business combination includes the direct cost of the acquisition 
the operating results of entities acquired are included in the company s consolidated statements of income from the completion date of the applicable transaction 
in recording various business combinations  the company has assigned the excess of the cost of its acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed to goodwill  the balance of which totaled million at december  in and prior years  the company amortized goodwill to expense over the expected benefit period  ranging from to years 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other changes to prior practices  the new standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur between annual tests indicating that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired based on a fair value concept 
sfas requires that impairment testing of the opening goodwill balances be performed within six months from the start of the fiscal year in which the standard is adopted and that any impairment be written off and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have completed an initial review and do not currently expect to record an impairment charge 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
the company ceased amortization of its remaining goodwill balance effective january  investments 
the company holds less than majority investments in strategically aligned companies that included a million investment at december  in chiles offshore  which is traded publicly 
the company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock when such investments in voting stock gives it the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of a company even though it holds or less of the voting stock 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the company owns between and of an entity s voting stock  although the ability to exercise influence may be indicated in several ways even when such investments are below 
the company also holds less significant investments  carried at cost  in private companies over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence nor does it own greater than of the entity s voting stock 
the company may record investment impairment charges when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and except for those transactions that are effective hedges for accounting purposes in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  gains and losses are included in the determination of our net income 
the derivative contracts recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheets are stated at their fair values  which the company acquired from third parties that regularly conduct business in the derivative contracts  which we have negotiated 
future adverse changes in the market price for the underlying notional amounts of our derivative contracts may result in losses in our statement of income or other comprehensive income  if hedge accounting criteria are met 
carrying value of vessels 
the company depreciates its vessels over to years from date of original construction  except for standby safety vessels where it has chosen a useful life of years 
in assigning depreciable lives to its vessels  the company has considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic factors that could impact commercial viability 
furthermore  salvage value  an amount typically expected to be recovered through sale upon vessel retirement  approximates of cost 
to date  the company s experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although  there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate the recoverability of the carrying amount of a vessel might not be possible 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of a vessel s carrying amount should be assessed might include i a significant decrease in the market value of a vessel  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a vessel and iii current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with a vessel 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that a vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable  the company would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel  the company would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
income taxes 
at december   the company had not provided for us income taxes with respect to million of undistributed earnings of certain non us subsidiaries and or less owned companies as it is the company s intention to indefinitely invest these earnings abroad 
should a remittance of these earnings be expected in the foreseeable future  the company would then be required to provision for the related us income tax consequences 
stock and debt repurchase program seacor s board of directors previously approved a securities repurchase plan  which allows the company to acquire common stock  notes and its notes collectively  the seacor securities and  prior to the deconsolidation of chiles offshore in  certain of the chiles notes 
in  a total of  shares of common stock were acquired for treasury at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in   shares of common stock were acquired for treasury at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
as of december   the company had approximately million available for the repurchase of additional seacor securities that may be conducted from time to time through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  depending on market conditions 
stock incentive and purchase plans stock incentive plans 
on november  and april   seacor s stockholders adopted the non qualified stock option plan the stock option plan and the share incentive plan the share incentive plan  respectively collectively  the plans 
the plans provide for the grant of options to purchase shares of common stock  and the share incentive plan additionally provides for the grant of stock appreciation rights  restricted stock awards  performance awards and stock units to key officers and employees of the company 
the exercise price per share of options granted cannot be less than and of the fair market value of common stock at the date of grant under the stock option plan and share incentive plan  respectively 
options granted under the plans expire no later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant 
the plans are administered by the stock option and executive compensation committee of the board of directors 
seven hundred fifty thousand shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under each of the stock option plan and the share incentive plan 
in and  the company granted  and  shares and or options to purchase shares of common stock  respectively 
at december   there were  shares available for future grant under the plans 
employee stock purchase plan 
on may   the stockholders of seacor approved the employee stock purchase plan the stock purchase plan that permits seacor to offer common stock for purchase by eligible employees at a price equal to of the lesser of i the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or ii the fair market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period 
common stock will be available for purchase under the stock purchase plan for six month offering periods 
three hundred thousand shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the stock purchase plan during the ten years following its adoption 
the stock purchase plan is intended to comply with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  but is not intended to be subject to section a of the code or the employee retirement income security act of the board of directors of seacor may amend or terminate the stock purchase plan at any time  however  no increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the stock purchase plan may be made without stockholder approval 
in   shares of common stock were issued from treasury pursuant to the stock purchase plan 
no shares of common stock were issued in non employee director stock option plan 
on may   the stockholders of seacor approved the stock option plan for non employee directors the non employee director plan 
under the non employee director plan  each member of the board of directors who is not an employee of seacor or any subsidiary will be granted an option to purchase  shares of common stock on the date of each annual meeting of the stockholders of seacor through and including the annual meeting of stockholders 
the exercise price of the options granted under the non employee director plan will be equal to of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date the options are granted 
one hundred fifty thousand shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the non employee director plan 
options granted under the non employee director plan will be exercisable at any time following the earlier of the first anniversary of  or the first annual meeting of seacor s stockholders after  the date of grant  for a period of up to ten years from date of grant 
subject to the accelerated vesting of options upon a non employee director s death or disability  if a non employee director s service as a director of seacor is terminated  his or her options will terminate with respect to the shares of common stock as to which such options are not then exercisable 
a non employee director s options that are vested but not exercised may  subject to certain exceptions  be exercised within three months after the date of termination of service as a director in the case of termination by reason of voluntary retirement  failure of seacor to nominate such director for re election or failure of such director to be re elected by stockholders after nomination by seacor  or within one year in the case of termination of service as a director by reason of death or disability 
in and  options were granted for the purchase of  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
effects of inflation the company s global operations expose it to the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations 
to minimize the financial impact of these items  the company may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with major domestic or international financial institutions aimed at reducing the risk that the us denominated value of anticipated transactions in foreign currencies will be reduced or the cost of any such obligations increased as a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies valued against the dollar 
although the company does not consider inflation a significant business risk in the current and foreseeable future  in the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy  inflationary pressures may result in increased operating and financing costs 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair market value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair market value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the cumulative effect of adopting sfas was not material 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge against its exposure to changes in foreign currencies  prices of natural gas and crude oil and interest rates 
to protect certain of the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of the us dollar cash flows to be derived from net assets 
at december   there were no outstanding forward exchange contracts for which hedge accounting criteria were met 
in and  the company also entered into forward exchange contracts that are considered speculative with respect to norwegian kroners  pounds sterling and euros 
the norwegian kroner contracts enabled the company to buy norwegian kroners in the future at fixed exchange rates which could have offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange had it decided to conduct business in norway 
the pound sterling and euro contracts enable the company to buy pounds sterling and euros in the future at fixed exchange rates  which could offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange of its business conducted in the united kingdom and europe 
for the twelve month periods ending december  and  the company recognized net gains of million and net losses of million  respectively  from these forward exchange contracts 
at december   there were no outstanding norwegian kroner contracts and the fair market values of its speculative pound sterling and euro contracts totaled million and was reported in the consolidated balance sheet as trade and other receivables 
natural gas and crude oil swaps  options and futures contracts are employed by the company to provide it value should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline  which  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows 
us treasury notes and us treasury bonds options and futures contracts  which began in  provide value to the company should the price of us treasury notes and bonds decline leading to generally higher interest rates which  if sustained over time  might lead to a higher interest cost for the company 
for the twelve month periods ending december   and  the company has recognized net losses of million  net losses of million and net gains of million  respectively  from commodity hedging activities  and the fair market value of the company s positions in commodity contracts at december  totaled million and was reported in the consolidated balance sheet as trade and other receivables 
for the twelve month period ending december   the company has recognized net gains of million from us treasury note and us treasury bond future contracts  and the company s unrealized loss with respect to its positions in us treasury obligations totaled million and was reported in the consolidated balance sheet as other current liabilities 
effective january   the company adopted sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other changes to prior practices  the new standards require i the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations  ii that goodwill not be amortized in any circumstance and iii that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur between annual tests indicating that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired based on a fair value concept 
sfas requires that impairment testing of the opening goodwill balances be performed within six months from the start of the fiscal year in which the standard is adopted and that any impairment be written off and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have completed an initial review and do not currently expect to record an impairment charge 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
the company ceased amortization of its remaining goodwill balance effective january  goodwill amortization was million in  million in and million in in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recording the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
upon adoption of the standard  the company will be required to use a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for any existing retirement obligation liabilities  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
the nature of the company s business and long lived assets is such that adoption of this new standard should have no significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supercedes certain aspects of accounting principle board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb additionally  certain dispositions may now qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company expects this statement will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  the following factors should be considered carefully 
the company s industry is subject to cyclicality and a significant or prolonged decline in oil and gas prices would likely reduce the level of exploration and development of offshore areas  which would reduce demand for the company s offshore marine services 
the company s industry is highly cyclical 
activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry has a significant impact on the company s offshore marine operations 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile and  as a result  the level of offshore exploration and drilling activity also has been extremely volatile 
reductions in oil and gas prices generally result in decreased drilling and production and corresponding decreases in demand for the company s vessels and logistics services 
decreased demand for these services would reduce the company s revenue and profitability 
the company relies on several customers for a significant share of our revenues  the loss of which could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company s customers are primarily the major oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies  members of the shipping community and owners of refineries  pipelines and tank terminals 
the portion of the company s revenues attributable to any single customer changes over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by the customer  the company s ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
during  the company derived approximately of its offshore marine service segment operating revenue from exxonmobil corporation 
during  the company s environmental service segment derived approximately of its environmental retainer revenue from citgo petroleum corporation and from el paso corporation  its two largest customers 
the company may incur significant costs  liabilities and penalties in complying with government regulations 
government regulation  such as international conventions  federal  state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where the company s vessels operate or are registered  have a significant impact on our offshore marine and environmental response businesses 
these regulations relate to worker health and safety  the manning  construction and operation of vessels  oil spills and other aspects of environmental protection 
risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for non compliance  particularly with respect to environmental laws and regulations  are inherent in the company s business 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a substantial negative impact on the company s profitability and financial position 
the company cannot predict whether it will incur such costs or penalties in the future 
the company faces intense competition that could adversely affect its ability to increase its market share and revenues 
the company s businesses operate in highly competitive industries 
high levels of competition could reduce its revenues  increase its expenses and reduce its profitability 
in addition to price  service and reputation  important competitive factors for offshore fleets of vessels include customers national flag preference  operating conditions and intended use all of which determine the suitability of available vessels  complexity of logistical support needs and presence of equipment in the appropriate geographical locations 
the primary competitive factors in the environmental service business are price  service  reputation  experience and operating capabilities 
in addition  the company believes that the absence of uniform environmental regulation and enforcement on international  federal  state and local levels has lowered barriers to entry in several market segments and increased the number of competitors 
the company s environmental service business faces competition from the marine spill response corporation a non profit corporation funded by the major integrated oil companies  other industry cooperatives and smaller contractors who target specific market niches 
an increase in supply of offshore support vessels would likely have a negative effect on the charter rates earned by the company s offshore support vessels  which would reduce the company s earnings 
expansion of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where the company operates 
increased refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity would lower charter rates and result in a corresponding reduction in revenues and profitability 
marine related risks could disrupt the company s offshore marine services and expose the company to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels is subject to various risks  including catastrophic marine disaster  adverse weather and sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  mechanical failure  collision  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of the company s personnel  vessels  cargo  equipment under tow and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  the company could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenue 
the company s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect the company from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses 
the company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its offshore marine and environmental response services 
there can be no assurance  however  that its existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  the company could be exposed to substantial liability 
the company s significant global operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
to minimize the financial impact of currency fluctuations and risks arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company attempts to contract the majority of its services in us dollars 
however  in some of its foreign businesses  the company collects revenues and pays expenses in local currency 
because the company conducts substantially all of its operations in us dollars  if the value of foreign currencies decline against the us dollar  the company s operating revenue in these foreign countries would effectively be reduced 
the company engages in certain currency hedging arrangements designed to minimize the effect of fluctuation in pounds sterling  the currency in the united kingdom  where most of its currency exchange risk arises 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because a significant proportion of the company s offshore marine operations are conducted in foreign countries  unstable political  military and economic conditions in those countries could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
during  approximately of the company s offshore marine revenues were derived from foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  among other things  of political instability  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo in nigeria  for example  could have a significant negative impact on activity in the oil and gas industry in offshore west africa  a region in which the company operates vessels 
in addition  the company s offshore support vessel operations in mexico are significantly affected by mexican government policy 
the company cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
the company may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of vessels the company owned  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
spill response revenue is dependent upon the magnitude and number of spill responses 
the company s environmental service business spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable fiscal periods based on the number and magnitude of spill responses in any given period 
as a result  the company s revenue and profitability attributable to this business may vary greatly from period to period 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for the company s environmental service 
the company s environmental service business is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa and  to a lesser extent  upon state regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for the company s environmental service segment s services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for the company s oil spill response services could be reduced  which could have a negative impact on its profitability 
a change in  or revocation of  nrc s classification as an oil spill removal organization would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified as an osro 
osro classification is a voluntary process conducted by the coast guard 
the coast guard classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills in different operating environments  such as rivers canals  inland waters and oceans 
coast guard classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers 
customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the coast guard 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  the company could lose customers  in which case its revenues and profitability would decline 
the company s environmental service business may incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although the company s environmental service business is generally exempt from liability under the federal clean water act for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption would not apply if it was found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it fails to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the clean water act 
in addition  the exemption under the federal clean water act would not protect the company s environmental service business against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has foreign currency exchange risks primarily related to its vessel operations that are conducted from ports located in the united kingdom where its functional currency is pounds sterling 
the financial statements of the company s united kingdom operations are measured using the pound sterling 
changes in the strength of that currency relative to the us dollar and the corresponding adjustment to the net assets of those operations caused by exchange rate fluctuations result in the recognition of currency translation adjustments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the total net assets of pound sterling functional investees as of december  was approximately pound million 
a weakening in the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the us dollar would result in an after tax charge of million to other comprehensive income related to these investments 
to protect the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of us dollar cash flows to be derived from the net assets 
the company considers these forward exchange contracts as economic hedges of a net investment because the translation adjustments resulting from the forward exchange contracts move in the opposite direction from the translation adjustments resulting from the restatement of its united kingdom subsidiaries net assets 
at december   there were no outstanding forward exchange contracts for which hedge accounting criteria were met 
the company has also entered into forward exchange contracts that are considered speculative during and with respect to norwegian kroners  pounds sterling  and euros 
the norwegian kroner contracts enabled the company to buy norwegian kroners in the future at fixed exchange rates which could have offset possible consequences of changes in foreign currency exchange rates had it decided to conduct business in norway 
the pound sterling and euro contracts enable the company to buy pounds sterling and euros in the future at fixed exchange rates  which could offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange of its business conducted in the united kingdom and europe 
at december   there were no outstanding norwegian kroner contracts and the fair market values of its speculative pound sterling and euro contracts totaled million and was reported in the consolidated balance sheet as trade and other receivables 
natural gas and crude oil swaps  options  and futures contracts are employed by the company to provide it value should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline  which  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows 
us treasury notes and us treasury bonds options and futures contracts provide value to the company should the price of us treasury notes and bonds decline leading to generally higher interest rates which  if sustained over time  might lead to a higher interest cost for the company 
at december   the fair market value of the company s positions in commodity contracts totaled million and was reported in the consolidated balance sheet as trade and other receivables 
also at december   the company s unrealized loss with respect to its positions in us treasury obligations totaled million and was reported in the consolidated balance sheet as other current liabilities 
in november  seacor advanced its wholly owned subsidiary  stirling shipping  a pound sterling functional currency investee  million  or pound million  to assist stirling shipping with the repayment of indebtedness due a uk bank 
seacor considers its advance to stirling shipping an intercompany loan with payment expected in the foreseeable future 
until repaid  accounting standards require that changes in the exchange rate from the transaction date until the settlement date with respect to this intercompany loan be included in the determination of net income 
a weakening in the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the us dollar would result in the company s recognition of million foreign currency transaction loss with respect to this advance 
the company s debt is primarily in fixed interest rate instruments 
while the fair value of these debt instruments will vary with changes in interest rates  the company has fixed most of its cash flow requirements and operations are not significantly affected by interest rate fluctuations 
for a portion of the company s fixed debt instruments  the notes  the fair value is driven by the conversion feature rather than interest rates 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount of the notes was outstanding 
the company s only significant variable rate debt instrument is its revolving credit facility  under which the company had only million outstanding at december  while available for liquidity requirements  the company has not historically utilized significant portions of the facility for any extended periods of time and thus has not been significantly impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
in order to reduce its cost of capital  the company entered into swap agreements during the fourth quarter of with a major financial institution with respect to notional amounts equal to a portion of its notes 
pursuant to each such agreement  such financial institution agreed to pay to the company an amount equal to interest paid on the notional amount of the notes subject to such agreement  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution an amount equal to interest currently at the rate of approximately per annum on the agreed upon price of such notional amount of the notes as set forth in the applicable swap agreement 
at december   million notional principal amount of the notes were covered by such swap agreements 
upon termination of each swap agreement  the financial institution agreed to pay to the company the amount  if any  by which the fair market value of the notional amount of the notes subject to the swap agreement on such date exceeded the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreement  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution the amount  if any  by which the agreed upon price of such notional amount exceeded the fair market value of such notional amount on such date 
the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreement totaled million 
at december   there was an unrealized loss  totaling million  which resulted from the agreed upon price exceeding the fair value of the notional amounts set forth in the swap agreements 
the swap agreements terminate during the fourth quarter of unless extended by mutual consent
