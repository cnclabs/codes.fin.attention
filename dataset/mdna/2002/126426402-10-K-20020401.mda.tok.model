item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a growing provider of telecommunications services to residential and business customers located primarily in north carolina 
we offer an integrated package of telecommunications services consisting of local and long distance telephone services  internet and data services  and digital wireless products and services 
we have worked to expand our ilec business in recent years by adding additional telecommunications services to our integrated service packages  emphasizing customer service and taking advantage of the strong demographic growth in our service area 
another key component to our business strategy is to grow our clec  greenfield  internet and data services  and digital wireless businesses 
we significantly expanded our internet and data services during the last four years through our acquisitions of vnet  webserve  and several other local internet providers 
during  we expanded our wireless business through the partitioning of our area of the cingular digital network 
additionally  our greenfield operation continues to expand through additional preferred provider agreements with developers and builders 
we devoted substantial effort in the past three years to developing business plans  enhancing our management team and board of directors  and designing and developing our business support and operating systems 
development of these areas has required significant investment of capital and start up expenses 
we believe that through these investments  we are positioning ourselves to achieve our strategic objectives 
our primary focus is to maximize our ilec business in our current markets by cross selling integrated products and packages and growing our customer base through our clec  greenfield  internet and data services  and digital wireless businesses 
we will also consider strategic acquisitions and investments as opportunities arise 
critical accounting policies and estimates ct communications discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continuously evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company holds investments in various companies having operations primarily within telecommunications  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
estimated useful lives utilized by the company and related amortization are subject to change based on economic conditions and accounting rules 
in the event that economic factors or accounting rules change  annual amounts amortized may increase or decrease 
the company depreciates assets over their determinable estimated useful lives 
useful lives are periodically reviewed  along with retirements  salvage values  and obsolescence to determine any potential adjustment in the useful lives of assets 
the company adjusts the useful lives as appropriate 
in addition  the company periodically reviews the carrying value of assets for impairment by assessing the recoverability of such carrying value through estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
during we managed our internal financial reporting along certain business segments 
we have identified those six that are reportable segments under generally accepted accounting principles 
beginning on january  we began segregating clec and greenfield 
prior to that date  greenfield was included within clec 
when comparing results  clec and greenfield should be combined for for comparability with and presentation 
selected data by business segment  excluding intersegment revenue and expense  was as follows for the years ended december    and years ended december  in thousands operating revenues ilec    clec    greenfield  long distance services    internet and data services    digital wireless services    other  consolidated operating revenues    years ended december  in thousands operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization ilec    clec    greenfield  long distance services    internet and data services    digital wireless services    other   consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization    operating ebitda ilec    clec    greenfield  long distance services    internet and data services digital wireless services    other   consolidated ebitda    operating income ilec    clec    greenfield  long distance services    internet and data services   digital wireless services    other   consolidated operating income    capital expenditures ilec    clec    greenfield  long distance services  internet and data services    digital wireless services other  consolidated capital expenditures    years ended december  in thousands net plant equipment ilec    clec    greenfield  long distance services    internet and data services    digital wireless services  other  consolidated net plant and equipment    summary consolidated cash flow data net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    operating ebitda represents earnings before other income expense  interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to analyze companies on the basis of operating performance and liquidity 
operating ebitda is presented because management believes it provides financial results for the core operations of each business entity or segment and  as a result  excludes non operating activities such as investment income 
management believes that investors may use this data to analyze and compare other communications companies with us in terms of operating performance and liquidity 
operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of performance  or for cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
operating ebitda  as calculated by us  is not necessarily comparable to similarly captioned amounts of other companies 
capital expenditures in for digital wireless services do not include million paid during the year for partitioning of the company s portion of the cingular digital network which was accounted for as an acquisition 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated

the average revenue per minute has declined from to we expect long distance revenue to remain steady as decreasing rate plans offset customer and minute increases 
long distance services operating expenses were million  a million or decrease over the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to a decline in carrier transport and termination expense due to lower rates on negotiated contracts 
these lower rates more than offset the decrease in revenue rates charged under the new customer service plans discussed above
