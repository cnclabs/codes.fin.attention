results of operations unusual loss events 
as a result of the terrorist attacks at the world trade center  the pentagon and on various airlines on september  collectively the september attacks  the company incurred pre tax losses  based on an estimate of ultimate exposure developed through a review of its coverages  which totaled million gross of reinsurance and million net of reinsurance 
associated with this reinsurance were million of pre tax charges  predominantly from adjustment premiums  resulting in a total pre tax loss from the september attacks of million 
after tax recoveries relating specifically to this unusual loss event  the net loss from the september attacks totaled million 
over of the losses ceded were to treaties  where the reinsurers obligations are secured  which the company believes eliminates material reinsurance collection risk 
as a result of the enron bankruptcy in  the company has incurred losses  after tax and net of reinsurance  amounting to million 
this unusual loss reflects all of the company s exposures to this event  including underwriting  credit and investment 
industry conditions 
the worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive 
the september attacks resulted in losses which reduced industry capacity and were of sufficient magnitude to cause most individual companies to reassess their capital position  tolerance for risk  exposure control mechanisms and the pricing terms and conditions at which they are willing to take on risk 
the gradual and variable improving trend that had been apparent through and earlier in firmed significantly 
this firming generally took the form of immediate and significant upward pressure on prices  more restrictive terms and conditions and a reduction of coverage limits and capacity availability 
such pressures were widespread with variability depending on the product and markets involved  but mainly depending on the characteristics of the underlying risk exposures 
the magnitude of the changes was sufficient to create temporary disequilibrium in some markets as individual buyers and sellers adapted to changes in both their internal and market dynamics 
these changes reflect a reversal of the general trend from through toward increasingly competitive global market conditions across most lines of business as reflected by decreasing prices and broadening contract terms 
the earlier trend resulted from a number of factors  including the emergence of significant reinsurance capacity in bermuda  changes in the lloyds market  consolidation and increased capital levels in the insurance and reinsurance industries  as well as the emergence of new reinsurance and financial products addressing traditional exposures in alternative fashions 
many of these factors continue to exist 
as a result  although the company is encouraged by the recent improvements  and more generally  current market conditions  the company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these improvements will persist 
segment information the company  through its subsidiaries  operates in five segments us reinsurance  us insurance  specialty underwriting  international and bermuda 
the us reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis through reinsurance brokers as well as directly with ceding companies within the united states 
the us insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the united states 
the specialty underwriting operation writes accident and health a h  marine  aviation and surety business within the united states and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies 
the international operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through the company s branches in belgium  london  canada  and singapore  in addition to foreign home office business 
the bermuda operation writes property  casualty  life and annuity business through brokers and directly with ceding companies 
these segments are managed in a carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control  including with respect to capital  investments and support operations 
as a result  management monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments principally based upon their underwriting results 
the company utilizes inter affiliate reinsurance and such reinsurance does not impact segment results  since business is reported within the segment in which the business was first produced 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums 
gross premiums written increased to  million in from  million in  as the company took advantage of selected growth opportunities  while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach 
premium growth areas included a million increase in the bermuda operation  a million increase in the us insurance operation  principally attributable to growth in worker s compensation insurance  a million increase in the specialty underwriting operation  mainly attributable to growth in a h medical stop loss writings  and a million increase in the us reinsurance operation  primarily reflecting improved market conditions 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the international operation 
the company continued to decline business that did not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability 
ceded premiums increased to million in from million in this increase was principally attributable to million of adjustment premiums incurred under the accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the company s corporate retrocessional program relating to losses incurred as a result of the september attacks and the enron bankruptcy 
in addition  ceded premiums for and also include adjustment premiums of million and million  respectively  relating to claims made under the accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the company s corporate retrocessional program 
the increase in ceded premiums in also reflects the impact on the us insurance operation s specific reinsurance protections resulting from this segment s volume increase 
net premiums written increased by to  million in from  million in this increase was consistent with the increase in gross premiums written and the increase in ceded premiums 
premium revenues 
net premiums earned increased by to  million in from  million in contributing to this increase were a million increase in the us insurance operation  a million increase in the bermuda operation  a million increase in the specialty underwriting operation  a million increase in the us reinsurance operation and a million increase in the international operation 
all of these changes reflect period to period variability in gross written and ceded premiums  and business mix  together with normal variability in earnings patterns 
business mix changes occur not only as the company shifts emphasis between products  lines of business  distribution channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non renew  almost always with changes in coverage  structure  prices and or terms  and as new contracts are accepted with coverages  structures  prices and or terms different from those of expiring contracts 
as premium reporting and earnings and loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts  the continuous turnover of individual contracts  arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting  can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items 
expenses 
incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased by to  million in from million in the increase in incurred losses and lae was principally attributable to an increase in business volume as reflected by the increase in net premiums earned  the impact of incurred losses relating to the september attacks and the enron bankruptcy and modest reserve strengthening in select areas  together with the impact of changes in the company s mix of business 
the enron bankruptcy contributed million of unusual losses in before cessions under the corporate retrocessional program 
incurred losses and lae include catastrophe losses  which reflect the impact of both current period events and favorable and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance

the company continued to decline business that did not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability

critical accounting policy the company s most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and lae reserves 
the company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae with respect to reported and unreported claims 
because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses and lae  management monitors reserve adequacy over time  evaluating new information as it becomes known and adjusting reserves  as necessary 
management considers many factors when setting reserves  including current legal interpretations of coverage and liability  economic conditions  internal actuarial methodologies which analyze the company s experience with similar cases  information from ceding companies and historical trends  such as reserving patterns  loss payments  pending levels of unpaid claims and product mix  and the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements for asbestos and environmental claims 
based on these considerations  management believes that adequate provision has been made for the company s loss and lae reserves 
actual losses and lae ultimately paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from such reserves  impacting income in the period in which the change is made 
see also footnote to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos and environmental exposures 
the company s asbestos claims typically involve liability or potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or liability for property damage resulting from asbestos or asbestos containing materials 
the company s environmental claims typically involve potential liability for the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land  air or water 
in addition to the previously described general uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves  there are significant additional uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses from asbestos and environmental claims 
among the complications impacting the estimation of such losses are potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination  difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and or liability for asbestos or environmental damage  changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws  potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods  long reporting delays  both from insureds to insurance companies and ceding companies to reinsurers  historical data concerning asbestos and environmental losses  which is more limited than historical information on other types of casualty claims  questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage  and uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure 
management believes that these factors continue to render reserves for asbestos and environmental losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial methods than are reserves on other types of losses 
given these uncertainties  management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established 
the company establishes reserves to the extent that  in the judgment of management  the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the company or its ceding company 
due to the uncertainties discussed above  the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and could have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
financial condition cash and invested assets 
aggregate invested assets  including cash and short term investments  were  million at december    million at december  and  million at december  the increase in cash and invested assets from to resulted primarily from million in cash flows from operations generated in and million in net unrealized appreciation of the company s fixed maturity investments 
these increases were partially offset by million in net payments on holdings credit facility and million in net unrealized depreciation of the company s equity investments 
the increase in cash and invested assets from to resulted primarily from holdings issuance of senior notes totaling million  the proceeds of which have been invested  million of new cash from the acquisition of mt 
mckinley  million of new invested assets from the acquisition of afc re  million in credit facility borrowings  million in net unrealized appreciation of the company s fixed maturity investments and million in cash flows from operations generated in these increases were partially offset by million in net unrealized depreciation of the company s equity investments and million in share repurchases 
loss and lae reserves 
gross loss and lae reserves totaled  million at december    million at december  and  million at december  the increase in was primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses resulting from the september attacks  together with increased earned premiums and normal variability in claim settlements 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of mt 
mckinley together with increased earned premiums and normal variability in claim settlements 
reinsurance receivables totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december   with the changes in principally reflecting the increase in losses ceded under the accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the company s corporate retrocessional program 
at december   million  or  was receivable from subsidiaries of london reinsurance group london life  which is fully secured by a combination of letters of credit and funds held arrangements whereby the company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaires  recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire and million  or  was receivable from continental insurance company continental  which are partially secured by funds held arrangements 
no other retrocessionaire accounted for more than of the company s receivables

net paid losses  excluding the impact of the mt

the gross and net ibnr reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures increased in the increase was mainly attributable to holdings acquisition of mt 
mckinley in september of the gross and net ibnr reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures decreased in and the decrease resulted primarily from management s belief that there had been not been a material change in the ultimate asbestos and environmental loss exposures 
as a result  the reported incurred losses in were partly offset with corresponding reductions in ibnr reserves and in were fully offset with corresponding reductions in ibnr reserves 
shareholders equity 
the company s shareholders equity increased to  million as of december  from  million as of december  principally reflecting an increase of million in retained earnings  an increase of million in net unrealized appreciation of investments and million in common shares issued during the year in connection with the exercise of stock options 
shareholders equity increased to  as of december  from  million as of december  principally reflecting an increase of million in retained earnings and an increase of million in net unrealized appreciation of investments  partially offset by million in treasury shares acquired during the year 
dividends of million  million and million were declared and paid by the company in  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased million of its common shares at an average price of per share with all such repurchases occurring in the three months ended march   raising the total repurchases under the company s authorized repurchase program to million shares at an average price of per share with a total repurchase expenditure to date of million 
at december   million shares remained under the existing repurchase authorization 
as part of the company s restructuring  the treasury shares held by the company prior to february  were retired  resulting in a reduction to treasury shares with a corresponding reduction of paid in capital and common shares 
liquidity and capital resources capital 
the company s business operations are in part dependent on the company s financial strength  and the market s perception thereof  as measured by shareholders equity  which was  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company has flexibility with respect to capitalization as the result of its access to the debt and equity markets 
the company continuously monitors its capital and financial position  as well as investment and security market conditions  in general and with respect to the company s securities  and responds accordingly 
on november   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which provided for the issuance of up to million of common equity 
on february   pursuant to this registration statement  the company completed an offering of  of its common shares at a price of per share  which resulted in million of proceeds before expenses of approximately million related to the offering 
the company will use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
liquidity 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  taxable bond and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with the company s current and projected operating results  market conditions and tax position 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the company s liquidity requirements are met on a short term and long term basis by funds provided by premiums collected  investment income and collected reinsurance receivables balances  and from the sale and maturity of investments together with the availability of funds under the company s revolving credit facility 
the following table shows cash flows from operating activities  as well as the impacts of select transactions on those cash flows  for the years ended december   and cash flow from operations catastrophe loss payments stop loss agreement recoveries net tax payments non recurring receipt of shares cash flow from operations  net of adjustments recoveries under the company s stop loss agreement with mt

the reduction in net tax payments for generally reflects the tax impact of losses arising from the september attacks  partially offset by a million payment in connection with the company s tax year liabilities 
the million payment had no impact on the company s current year results of operations 
non recurring receipt of shares in a demutualized insurer 
management believes that net cash flows from operating activities are generally consistent with expectations given the company s investment strategies  mix of business and the normal variability of premium collections and the payout of loss reserves 
proceeds from sales  calls and maturities and investment asset acquisitions were  million and  million  respectively  in compared to  million and  million  respectively  in and million and  million  respectively  in additionally  the cash flow activity in included million of new cash resulting from the acquisitions of mt 
mckinley and everest international and million in proceeds from holdings offering of senior notes 
exposure to catastrophes 
as with other reinsurers  the company s operating results and financial condition can be adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and other disasters  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions and terrorist events 
any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the company s treaties or lines of business  including property and or casualty exposures 
although the company attempts to limit its exposure to acceptable levels  including through the purchase of reinsurance when considered to be cost effective  it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
the company employs various techniques  including licensed software modeling  to assess its accumulated exposure 
such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non property exposures 
accumulated exposures with respect to property catastrophe losses are summarized in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
the company defines pml as its anticipated maximum property loss  taking into account contract limits  caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area  such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every years 
management estimates that the company s greatest catastrophe exposure worldwide from any single event is to hurricanes and earthquakes in the coastal regions of the united states  where the company estimates it has a pml exposure  before reinsurance  of approximately million in each such region based on its current book of business 
similarly  management estimates that the largest current pml exposure  before reinsurance  outside the united states is approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed  perhaps by a substantial amount  its estimated pml  particularly if such events also give rise to casualty exposures 
nor can there be assurance that the company s reinsurance program will not change or that it will respond predictably to any given event 
the company employs a retrocessional approach where reinsurance may be purchased to cover specific business written or exposure accumulations or it may be purchased as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the company s operations 
all reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing  terms  conditions and availability of such coverage  with the aim of securing cost effective protection 
the level of reinsurance coverage varies over time  reflecting the underwriter s and or company s view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets 
the principal components of the company s existing corporate retrocessional protection program as it relates to catastrophes are an accident year aggregate excess of loss treaty and the retrocesssional excess of loss coverage of international exposures 
for both and  the company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage  which provides up to million of recoveries if everest re s consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeds a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years 
each arrangement provides for an adjustment premium  which reduces the net benefit by approximately  in the event that the coverage is used 
the remaining limits available under these coverages is million and million  respectively 
the company s corporate retrocessional protection program includes a two layer property catastrophe excess of loss program for losses incurred outside of the united states  which provide coverage of of million of losses in excess of million of losses per occurrence and of million of losses in excess of million of losses per occurrence 
this coverage relates to a twelve month period beginning june  and the continuation or replacement of such coverage in june cannot be assured 
all aspects of the retrocession program have been structured to permit the program to be accounted for as reinsurance under sfas no 
see item risk management and retrocession arrangements for further details 
if a single catastrophe were to occur in the united states that resulted in million of gross losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses alae in an amount equivalent to the company s pml  management estimates that the effect including additional premiums and retained losses and alae on the company s income before and after taxes would be approximately million and million  respectively 
dividends during  and  the company declared and paid shareholder dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
group 
under bermuda law  group is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if such payment would reduce the realizable value of its assets to an amount less than the aggregate value of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium additional paid in capital accounts 
group s ability to pay dividends and its operating expenses is partially dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by insurer subsidiaries is limited under bermuda law and the laws of the various us states in which group s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
the limitations are generally based upon net income and compliance with applicable policyholders surplus or minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio requirements as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices 
bermuda re 
under bermuda law  bermuda re is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or  if after payment of the dividend  it fails to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio 
as a long term insurer  bermuda re is also unable to declare or pay a dividend to anyone who is not a policyholder unless  after payment of the dividend  the value of the assets in its long term business fund  as certified by its approved actuary  will exceed its liabilities for long term business by at least the  minimum solvency margin 
prior approval of the bermuda minister of finance is required if bermuda re s dividend payments would reduce its prior year end total statutory capital by or more 
at december   bermuda re has met all requirements by a significant amount 
holdings 
holdings is a holding company whose only material assets are the capital stock of everest re and mt 
mckinley 
holdings cash flow consists primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from everest re and mt 
mckinley and borrowings under credit facilities 
holdings depends upon such payments for funds for general corporate purposes  including its debt and operating expense obligations 
on march   holdings completed public offerings of million principal amount of senior notes due march  and million principal amount of senior notes due march  during  the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by holdings to group 
interest expense incurred in connection with these senior notes was million and million at december  and  respectively 
on december   holdings entered into a three year senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders the credit facility  which replaced its prior credit facility which had been extended in june and increased from million to million on november  first union national bank is the administrative agent for the credit facility 
the credit facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility provides for the borrowing of up to million with interest at a rate selected by holdings equal to either the base rate as defined below or an adjusted london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
the base rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by first union national bank from time to time as its prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum 
on december   the credit facility was amended to extend the borrowing limit to million for a period of days 
this day period expired during the three months ended march  and the limit reverted to million 
the amount of margin and the fees payable for the credit facility depend upon holding s senior unsecured debt rating 
group has guaranteed holdings obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility requires the company to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than to  holdings to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of to and everest re to maintain its statutory surplus at million plus of future aggregate net income and of future aggregate capital contributions 
the company was in compliance with these requirements at december  at december  and  holdings had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of million and million  respectively 
interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings was million and million at december  and  respectively 
everest re 
the payment of dividends to holdings by everest re is subject to limitations imposed by the delaware insurance code 
based upon these restrictions  the maximum amount that will be available for payment of dividends to holdings by everest re in without the prior approval of regulatory authorities is million 
everest re s future cash flow available to holdings may be influenced by a variety of factors  including changes in the property and casualty reinsurance market  everest re s financial results  insurance regulatory changes and changes in general economic conditions 
the availability of such cash flow to holdings could also be influenced by  among other things  changes in the limitations imposed by the delaware insurance code on the payment of dividends by everest re 
holdings expects that  absent significant catastrophe losses  such restrictions should not affect everest re s ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support holdings general corporate needs

the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  taxable and tax preferenced fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company s mix of taxable and tax preferenced investments is adjusted continuously  consistent with its current and projected operating results  market conditions  and tax position 
the fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non trading available for sale securities 
additionally  the company invests in equity securities  which it believes will enhance the risk adjusted total return of the investment portfolio 
the company has also engaged in a small number of credit default swaps and specialized equity options  the market sensitivity of which is believed to be immaterial 
the overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated company operations 
in particular  estimates of the financial impact resulting from non investment asset and liability transactions  together with the company s capital structure and other factors  are used to develop a net liability analysis 
this analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which the investments of the company provide liquidity 
this analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
the change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the year with no material change in the underlying risk characteristics 
the company s billion investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity securities that are subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk  and equity securities that are subject to equity price risk 
the impact of these risks in the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their associated income statement impact 
interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio due to change in market interest rates 
further  it includes prepayment risk in a declining interest rate environment on the million of the billion fixed maturity portfolio  which consists of mortgage backed securities 
prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus  the expected yield of the security 
the tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after tax unrealized appreciation on the fixed maturity portfolio as of december  and based on parallel basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in basis point increments 
for legal entities with a us dollar functional currency  this modeling was performed on each security individually 
to generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage backed securities  changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments are taken into account 
for legal entities with a non us dollar functional currency  the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios

the company s foreign operations each maintain capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines 
generally  the company prefers to maintain the capital of its foreign operations in us dollar assets although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs 
each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates 
the primary foreign currency exposures are the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro for these foreign operations 
the company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating liabilities 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 the company translates the assets  liabilities and income of non us dollar functional currency legal entities to the us dollar 
this translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the primary functional foreign currency exposures are the canadian dollar  the belgian franc and the british pound sterling for these foreign operations 
the tables below display the potential impact of a parallel increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in increments as of december  and this analysis includes the after tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after tax impact of translation from functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency

the company intends these forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements in the federal securities laws 
in some cases  these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as may  will  should  could  anticipate  estimate  expect  plan  believe  predict  potential and intend 
forward looking statements contained in this report include information regarding the company s reserves for losses and lae and estimates of the company s catastrophe exposure 
forward looking statements only reflect the company s expectations and are not guarantees of performance 
these statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual events or results may differ materially from the company s expectations 
important factors that could cause actual events or results to be materially different from the company s expectations include those discussed below under the caption risk factors 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risk factors the following risk factors  in addition to the other information provided in this report  should be considered when evaluating the company 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of the company s common shares could decline significantly 
the company s results may fluctuate as a result of factors generally affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry 
the results of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general could also cause the company s results to fluctuate 
the industry s profitability can be affected significantly by o fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may impact the ultimate payout of loss amounts  o rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  o volatile and unpredictable developments  including weather related and other natural catastrophes  o events like the september  attacks  which affect the insurance and reinsurance markets generally  o changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and o the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate to meet its actual losses  the company s net income would be reduced or it could incur a loss 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims incurred 
these reserves are only estimates of what the company thinks the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to the company 
because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses  the company cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment reserves 
if the company s reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  the company would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings 
these charges could be material 
the difficulty in estimating the company s reserves is increased because the company s loss reserves include reserves for potential asbestos and environmental liabilities 
asbestos and environmental liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
the company s inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce its net income 
the company s success is dependent on its ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained 
if the company fails to assess accurately the risks it retains  the company may fail to establish appropriate premium rates and the company s reserves may be inadequate to cover its losses  requiring augmentation of the company s reserves  which in turn  could reduce the company s net income 
decreases in rates for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce the company s net income 
the company primarily writes property and casualty reinsurance and insurance 
the property and casualty industry historically has been highly cyclical 
rates for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of the company s control 
any significant decrease in the rates for property and casualty insurance or reinsurance could reduce the company s net income 
if rating agencies downgrade their ratings of the company s insurance company subsidiaries  the company s future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries  other than mt 
mckinley  currently hold an a superior financial strength rating from am best company  an aa very strong financial strength rating from standard poor s ratings services and an aa excellent financial strength rating from moody s investors service  inc financial strength ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance and insurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
in addition  the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance may be adversely affected by an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its reinsurer 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect the company s ability to market its insurance products and would have a significant and adverse effect on its future prospects for growth and profitability 
the company s reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations 
the company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve the company of its liability to the insured 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay the company even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the company s reinsurers to honor their obligations in a timely fashion would impact the company s cash flow and reduce its net income and could cause the company to incur a significant loss 
if the company is unable to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers  its net income could be reduced or the company could incur a loss 
the company attempts to limit its risk of loss by purchasing reinsurance to transfer a portion of the risks it assumes 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer risk through reinsurance arrangements 
a lack of available reinsurance might adversely affect the marketing of the company s programs and or force the company to retain all or a part of the risk that cannot be reinsured 
if the company were required to retain these risks and ultimately pay claims with respect to these risks  the company s net income could be reduced or the company could incur a loss 
the company s industry is highly competitive and the company may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company s industry is highly competitive and has experienced severe price competition over the last several years 
the company competes in the united states and international markets with domestic and international insurance companies 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company  have been operating for longer than the company and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
in addition  the company expects to face further competition in the future 
the company may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company is dependent on its key personnel 
the company s success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on its ability to retain the services of its existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any of its key executive officers or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business 
this dependency is particularly important for the company s bermuda operations where  under bermuda law  non bermudians  other than spouses of bermudians  are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without a work permit issued by the bermuda government 
a work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that  after proper public advertisement  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  is available who meets the minimum standards for the position 
the bermuda government recently announced a new policy that places a six year term limit on individuals with work permits  subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees 
the value of the company s investment portfolio and the investment income it receives from that portfolio could decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and a smaller portion consists of equity securities 
both the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
for example  the fair market value of the company s fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair market value of the company s fixed income securities can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
the net investment income that the company realizes from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations can also cause net investment income from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time the company bought them 
because all of the company s securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the market value of the company s securities are reflected in its financial statements 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in the company s portfolio could reduce its net income or cause the company to incur a loss 
insurance laws and regulations restrict the company s ability to operate 
the company is subject to extensive regulation under us  state and foreign insurance laws 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the company by its operating subsidiaries  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that they can hold  prescribe solvency standards that must be met and maintained by them and require them to maintain reserves 
these laws also require disclosure of material intercompany transactions and require prior approval of certain extraordinary transactions 
these extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds 
these laws also generally require approval of changes of control 
the company s failure to comply with these laws could subject it to fines and penalties and restrict it from conducting business 
the application of these laws could affect the company s liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its common shares and could restrict the company s ability to expand its business operations through acquisitions involving the company s insurance subsidiaries 
failure to comply with insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company cannot assure that it has or can maintain all required licenses and approvals or that its business fully complies with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
in addition  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if the company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend the company from carrying on some or all of its activities or monetarily penalize the company 
these types of actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s holding company structure could prevent it from paying dividends on its common shares 
group is a holding company whose most significant assets consist of the stock of its operating subsidiaries 
thus  the company s ability to pay dividends on its common shares in the future may be dependent on the earnings and cash flows of the company s subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to group 
this ability is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory and other factors beyond the company s control 
payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the company s operating subsidiaries are regulated by us  state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions  including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
accordingly  the company s operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to group in the future  which could prevent the company from paying dividends or making other payments or distributions on its securities 
the company may experience exchange losses if it does not manage its foreign currency exposure properly 
the company s functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  the company writes a portion of its business and receives a portion of its premiums in currencies other than united states dollars 
the company also maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than united states dollars 
consequently  the company may experience exchange losses if its foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged 
if the company seeks to hedge its foreign currency exposure by using forward foreign currency exchange contracts or currency swaps  the company will be subject to the risk that the counter parties to those arrangements will fail to perform  or that those arrangements will not precisely offset the company s exposure 
if us tax law changes  the company s net income may be reduced 
in the last few years  some members of congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign controlled insurers and reinsurers may have over us controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by us insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions  including bermuda 
legislation has been proposed in congress that might increase the us tax burden on some of these transactions 
the company does not know whether this legislation or any similar legislation will ever be enacted into law 
if it were enacted  the us tax burden on some business ceded from the company s licensed us insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers could be increased 
this could reduce the company s net income 
recently  some members of congress have introduced legislation designed to curb the expatriation of us corporations to low tax jurisdictions  such as bermuda  in transactions which leave a substantial percentage of the former us corporation s activities in the us and in which the former us corporation has very little activity in its new home jurisdiction 
at least one of these proposals would apply to corporations  such as the company  which expatriated several years ago 
the legislation  if adopted  would treat the company as subject to tax in the united states as if it were a us corporation 
the company does not know whether this legislation or any similar legislation will ever be enacted into law 
if it were enacted and applied retroactively to the company  the company could become subject to us taxes  which could reduce the company s net income 
group and or bermuda re may be subject to us corporate income tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
the income of bermuda re is a significant portion of the company s worldwide income from operations 
the company has established guidelines for the conduct of its bermuda operations that are designed to ensure that bermuda re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
based on its compliance with those guidelines  the company believes that bermuda re should not be required to pay us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a trade or business in the united states  bermuda re would be required to pay us corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re was engaged in a us trade or business  the us bermuda tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing bermuda re s income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary 
the company does not believe that bermuda re has a permanent establishment in the united states or any material income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states 
if the irs successfully contended that bermuda re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states  it would be subject to us tax on that income 
the company conducts its barbados operations in a manner designed to minimize the company s us tax exposure 
based on the company s compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that it generates only immaterial amounts  if any  of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  the company believes that it should be required to pay only immaterial amounts  if any  of us corporate income tax  other than withholding tax on us source dividend income 
however  if the irs successfully contended that the company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  the company would be required to pay us corporate income tax on that income  and possibly the us branch profits tax 
even if the irs successfully contended that the company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the united states  the us barbados tax treaty would preclude the irs from taxing the company s income  except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained in the united states 
the company does not believe that it has material amounts of income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states 
if the irs successfully contended  however  that the company did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states  the company would be subject to us tax on that income 
if bermuda re became subject to us income tax on its income or if the company became subject to us income tax on more than immaterial amounts of income  the company s income could also be subject to the us branch profits tax 
in that event  group and bermuda re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as us corporations 
the combined effect of the us corporate income tax rate and the branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 
the imposition of these taxes would reduce the company s net income 
holders of the company s common shares could be subject to us taxes on undistributed income of group and or bermuda re 
us holders of the company s common shares generally will not be subject to any us tax until they receive a distribution from group or dispose of their common shares 
however  special provisions of the us internal revenue code of  which the company refers to in this document as the code  may apply to us taxpayers who directly  indirectly or by attribution own or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of share capital of group and or bermuda re 
under these provisions  those taxpayers generally will be required to include in their income their pro rata share of the income of group and or bermuda re as earned  even if not distributed 
the company has attempted to avoid having its shareholders become subject to these provisions by including in the company s bye laws provisions that limit the ownership of the common shares to levels that will not subject us shareholders to us tax on undistributed income under these provisions 
based on these bye laws  the company believes that its shareholders should not be subject to us tax on undistributed income 
in addition  special provisions of the code apply to us persons who are shareholders of a foreign insurance company and have related person insurance income allocated to them 
related person insurance income  often called rpii  is investment income and premium income derived from the direct or indirect insurance or reinsurance of the risk of o any us tax payer who directly or indirectly through foreign entities owns shares of a foreign insurance company  or o any person related to a us taxpayer meeting the above definition 
the rpii provisions of the code could apply to us taxpayers who directly  indirectly or by attribution own any shares of bermuda re if o or more of the value or voting power of the share capital of bermuda re is owned directly  indirectly or by attribution by us taxpayers  o or more of the value or voting power of the share capital of bermuda re is owned directly  indirectly or by attribution by us taxpayers  or persons related to us taxpayers  who are insured or reinsured by bermuda re  and o bermuda re has gross rpii equal to or more of its gross insurance income 
the company currently believes that less than of the value or voting power of the share capital of bermuda re is owned directly  indirectly or by attribution by us taxpayers insured or reinsured by it or persons related to those taxpayers  and or that less than of the gross insurance income of bermuda re for any taxable year will constitute rpii 
however  if neither of these conditions is satisfied  since the company s us shareholders are treated by the code as indirectly owning shares of bermuda re  they will be required to include in their income their pro rata share of bermuda re s rpii as earned  even if not distributed 
gains resulting from the sale of the company s common shares by us shareholders could be taxed in the us as dividends 
generally  a us shareholder will realize capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of the common shares 
however  the irs could contend that special provisions of the code apply and that the amount of any gain equal to the company s allocable untaxed earnings and profits should be taxed as a dividend 
if the irs successfully contended that those provisions apply to the company  shareholders would be taxed on that amount of gain at the rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the lower rates applicable to long term capital gains 
assuming that none of the company s non us subsidiaries have any rpii  the company believes that these provisions of the code should not apply to the disposition of any common shares by a us shareholder who holds less than of the outstanding common shares 
the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union are considering measures that might increase the company s taxes and reduce its net income 
the organization for economic cooperation and development and the european union are considering measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
if these measures are adopted by a substantial number of member countries and if either bermuda or barbados is considered to be engaged in harmful tax competition  the company might be subject to additional taxes  which would reduce its net income 
in may  the government of bermuda made commitments to the oecd that reduce the likelihood of its being considered a tax haven 
in january  the government of barbados announced a similar agreement with the oecd 
group and or bermuda re may become subject to bermuda tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
group and bermuda re currently are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in bermuda 
both companies have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then that tax will not apply to them or to any of their operations or their shares  debentures or other obligations until march  this assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the land tax act of of bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any property leased to the company 
there are currently no procedures for extending these assurances 
as a result  group and bermuda re could be subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which could reduce the company s net income 
group may become subject to barbados tax  which would reduce the company s net income 
group has obtained an international business company license under the barbados international business companies act  based on this license  group is entitled to special tax benefits  including a preferred rate of tax on profits and gains and an exemption from withholding tax in respect of any dividends  interest  royalties  fees or management fees deemed to be paid to another international business company or to a person not resident in barbados 
group has also obtained from the ministry of economic development a fifteen year guarantee in accordance with section of the international business companies act with respect to its continued eligibility for this preferred status
