item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial summary the following table sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain financial statement elements expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  february  january  weeks weeks weeks percentage of net sales net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses store rent and related expenses depreciation and amortization expense restructuring charge interest expense loss income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss income stores in operation at period end critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management considers its most critical accounting policies to be related to inventory markdown and shrink reserves  the accrual for self insured workers compensation claims  impairment of long lived assets  and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
these critical accounting policies can significantly affect the company s reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the following factors could cause the company s estimates used in each of its critical accounting policies to significantly vary from the company s actual results o inventory markdowns and shrink reserves 
the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined under the retail method 
the anticipated sales value of inventory items is generally higher than the related cost 
periodically  the company identifies certain merchandise inventory to be marked down to facilitate its sale 
occasionally  markdowns may result in an item being sold for less than its original cost 
the company provides a reserve for the difference between original cost and the expected selling price of all inventory items expected to be sold below cost 
the company conducts a company wide physical inventory count during the first and third quarters of each fiscal year and adjusts its accounting records to reflect the results of the actual inventory counts 
the company records an inventory shrink reserve based primarily on recent actual shrink experience 
o accrual for self insured workers compensation claims 
the company is self insured for workers compensation up to an established stop loss amount beyond which claims are insured by a third party 
the company s self insurance accruals are based upon actuarially determined calculations of future claims 
o impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates whether long lived assets  primarily store leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment  have been impaired 
the company compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if an individual store s estimated future cash flows as determined in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset  impairment is indicated 
for stores which are determined to be impaired  leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment are written down to their fair values based upon management s estimate of recoverability 
charges for impairment are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
o deferred income taxes and valuation allowance 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future income tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities  assuming they will be realized and settled at the amount reported in the company s financial statements 
deferred tax assets also arise from unused net operating losses and unused tax credits 
management assesses the likelihood that future tax deductions and credits which give rise to deferred tax assets will be used based on their expirations and the level of taxable income that the company is expected to generate before the expiration of these tax credits 
based on this assessment  management establishes a valuation allowance to reduce all or part of these deferred tax assets 
if the company s future taxable income were to be less than expected  the company would have to record additional income tax expense and increase its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  if the company s future taxable income were to be greater than expected  the company may be able to reduce its valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
year ended february  fiscal weeks compared with year ended february  fiscal weeks during fiscal  the company implemented a strategy of eliminating its less profitable categories of merchandise  including gifts  home furnishings and children s accessories and de emphasizing uniforms and men s apparel in an effort to focus its resources on its core merchandise categories of women s and children s apparel and women s accessories 
the company experienced comparable store sales increases on these continuing categories of women s and children s apparel and women s accessories of for the last three months of fiscal  for the last six months of fiscal and for fiscal net sales in fiscal decreased to million compared with million in fiscal the decrease in net sales is primarily due to operating  on average  fewer stores in fiscal than in fiscal additionally  fiscal contained weeks while fiscal contained weeks 
in fiscal  comparable store sales decreased for the year compared with fiscal the decrease in comparable store sales for the week period is primarily due to the elimination of certain slow turning and lower margin categories 
comparable stores are those stores in operation at least months and there were such stores at february  during fiscal  the company opened stores  relocated or expanded stores and closed under performing stores 
during fiscal  the company opened stores  relocated or expanded stores and closed under performing stores 
in response to lower than expected operating results in fiscal  the company adopted a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal the plan included initiatives designed to improve the company s results of operations by lowering operating costs  re deploying assets and curtailing the number of new store openings until the company realized improved performance in its existing stores 
the plan called for the closing of low volume  under performing stores and elimination of positions 
as of february   the company had closed of the stores described in the plan and  in light of improved operating results  removed the two remaining stores and their associated liability from the restructuring plan 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal to cover the costs associated with the plan 
see note i of item of this report 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal this increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from the company s strategy of eliminating its less profitable categories of apparel and accessories 
sg a expenses increased to as a percentage of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased year over year primarily as a result of increases in payroll and utility costs in the company s stores 
average payroll in the company s stores increased in fiscal compared with fiscal an increase in average payroll rates was almost completely offset by fewer payroll hours on average 
the company has and continues to mitigate the effect of increasing payroll rates by managing store hours used and by seeking to improve sales in its existing stores 
utility costs increased per average store year over year due to sharp increases in prices of natural gas and electricity  particularly during the first six months of the year 
store rent and related expenses increased to of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal due to an increase in the company s average store rent and related expenses coupled with a decrease in comparable store sales 
average store rent and related expenses increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in average store rent and related expenses was primarily due to the company s store strategy during fiscal which resulted in the opening of larger stores in more expensive markets with higher rents while closing older stores with lower average rent cost 
management seeks to minimize increases in store rent expense through renegotiating lease terms  relocating stores  and leveraging rent increases through strategies of increased sales including focusing on key categories and reformatting stores where necessary 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the total stores the company opened in fiscal and fiscal and to capital leases entered into for new investment in information technology in the company s stores  which resulted in higher amortization costs 
interest expense increased to of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal interest expense in dollars also increased in fiscal when compared with fiscal primarily due to the higher average levels of borrowings on the revolving credit facility as a result of the company s losses in fiscal and fiscal  as well as increases in amortization of debt issue costs in fiscal due to amendments made to the company s credit agreements during fiscal the company s effective income tax rate of in fiscal as compared with in fiscal was primarily attributable to recording non cash valuation allowances of million against the company s deferred income tax assets during fiscal because management cannot be assured that certain net operating loss carryforwards  credit carryforwards and net cumulative temporary differences for us federal and state income tax purposes will be fully utilized or realized prior to their expirations  a valuation allowance has been provided against the related net deferred income tax assets 
management will continue to assess the adequacy of or the need for the valuation allowance based upon future operations 
year ended february  fiscal weeks compared with year ended january  fiscal weeks net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal the increase in net sales is primarily due to operating  on average  more stores in fiscal than in fiscal additionally  fiscal contained weeks while fiscal contained weeks 
in fiscal  comparable store sales decreased for the year compared with fiscal due to transitioning merchandise between seasons too slowly combined with comparable sales decreases in certain of the company s separates apparel categories 
the company operated comparable stores at february  during fiscal  the company opened stores  relocated or expanded stores and closed under performing stores 
during fiscal  the company opened stores  relocated or expanded stores and closed under performing stores 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from increased markdowns  which resulted from the slow transition of merchandise between seasons followed by the sell off of this remaining inventory  and the merchandise mix which contained a higher proportion of merchandise carrying lower margins than in fiscal sg a expenses increased to as a percentage of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal total sg a expenses increased as a percentage of net sales due to operating a higher proportion of new stores with higher average sales expectations than were realized and higher average operating costs

salaries and wages in the company s stores increased in dollars year over year due to an increase in the average hourly wage rate 
store rent and related expenses increased to of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal due to an increase in the company s average store rent and related expenses coupled with a decrease in comparable store sales 
average store rent and related expenses increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in average store rent and related expenses is primarily due to the company s store expansion strategy of opening larger  higher volume stores which typically are more costly sites with higher rents while closing older  under performing stores which generally have lower average rent costs 
depreciation and amortization expense was of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense in dollars increased in fiscal when compared with fiscal due primarily to the year over year increase in capital expenditures 
interest expense increased to of net sales in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal interest expense in dollars also increased in fiscal when compared with fiscal primarily due to the higher average levels of borrowings on the revolving credit facility in fiscal versus fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal  which was unusually low due to the favorable adjustment of the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal which had been recorded in fiscal inflation during its three most recent fiscal years  the company believes that the impact of inflation has not been material to its financial condition or results of operations 
occasionally  the company may experience slight increases in the average purchase price per unit of merchandise  however  such increases also reflect the impact of an increase in the quality of goods purchased in addition to minimal inflationary factors 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary needs for liquidity and capital have been to fund its new store expansion and the related growth in merchandise inventories 
the company historically has relied upon cash provided by operations and borrowed funds from its revolving credit facility to meet its liquidity needs 
during the two most recent fiscal years  the company has primarily relied upon its credit facilities to offset cash used in operations and cash used to open stores 
because of its relatively fixed cost structure and existing levels of debt  management considers its primary risk to liquidity to be its ability to generate adequate levels of net sales and gross margin while effectively controlling operating expenses 
the company relies on its planned net sales and gross margin to provide enough cash flow to meet its financial obligations 
when net sales and gross margin levels have not met plan in the past  the company has drawn funds under its credit facilities and or negotiated with its lenders to provide additional availability to meet its liquidity needs 
these credit facilities  together with cash provided by operations  are expected to meet the company s liquidity and capital needs during the period of the agreements 
the company s credit facilities consist of a revolving credit agreement and term loan to meet the company s short term liquidity needs  a mortgage loan collateralized by the company s corporate offices and distribution center and letter of credit facilities to accommodate the company s needs to purchase merchandise inventories from foreign sources 
collectively  the company s credit facilities contain certain financial and non financial covenants with which the company was in compliance at february  a summary of the company s credit facilities appears below 
please refer to note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s credit facilities require that these financial covenants be measured on a monthly basis 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of february  management believes that the company will be in compliance with all financial covenants during based upon achieving its planned operating results 
however  these planned operating results are dependent upon the company meeting certain improved fiscal targets of net sales  gross margin and operating expenses and  as a result  involve some degree of uncertainty 
if the company does not achieve its planned operating results  it is possible that the adjusted minimum net worth covenant may not be met during the second half of fiscal the company successfully obtained an amendment to its adjusted net worth covenant in december and  if necessary  will seek additional amendments to this covenant during fiscal the company has a  revolving credit agreement including a  letter of credit sub facility and  term loan with its primary lender through july borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are collateralized by all assets owned by the company during the term of the agreement other than land  buildings  fixtures and improvements collateralizing the mortgage loan discussed below 
maximum borrowings under the revolving credit facility and utilization of the letter of credit facility are based on a borrowing base formula determined with respect to eligible inventory as defined in the agreement 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest  at the company s option subject to certain limitations in the agreement  at the prime rate or the adjusted eurodollar rate  as defined  plus provided that the company meets certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth in agreement 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at per annum 
at february   the company had approximately million of excess availability under the borrowing base formula 
the maximum and average amounts outstanding during fiscal and fiscal and amounts outstanding at the end of such periods for the revolving credit facility are disclosed in note b to the consolidated financial statements in item of this document 
the company entered into a twenty year mortgage agreement with a commercial bank in june the agreement  which had an original balance of  is secured by the company s real property located at its corporate offices including land  buildings  fixtures and improvements 
the mortgage agreement  which had a balance of  at february   is payable in consecutive equal monthly installments including interest at the rate of per annum through july certain fees may be payable by the company if the mortgage loan is repaid prior to june the company also has an agreement with a commercial bank to provide a separate letter of credit facility of up to  which expires on the earlier of june  or termination of the company s revolving credit agreement with its primary lender 
letters of credit issued under the agreement are collateralized by inventories purchased using such letters of credit 
the agreement contains the same working capital and minimum net worth requirements as required by the company s primary lender under the revolving credit agreement 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which are substantially the same as those within the company s revolving credit facility discussed above 
the company s weighted average interest rate for all borrowings was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company had outstanding letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventories totaling approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of the loss from operations and increases in inventories and was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and other liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of the loss from operations and changes in income tax accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was  the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of positive results of operations and a decrease in merchandise inventories 
at february   total merchandise inventories increased to  compared with  at february  the increase in total merchandise inventories was primarily attributable to a higher level of merchandise in transit to the company s stores as a result of increasing its levels of imported merchandise compared with fiscal  and changing inventory ownership from fob consolidator at february  to fob shipping point at february  in fiscal  import purchases including freight and duty were of total purchases compared with in fiscal the company purchases its merchandise inventories principally from domestic vendors 
the level and source of inventories are subject to fluctuations because of the company s buying strategy and prevailing business conditions 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was   and  respectively  and was primarily used for leasehold improvements and equipment for new stores opened each year  as well as information technology expenditures including software and hardware upgrades 
the amounts of cash used in investing activities varied year to year as a result of the company s opening stores in fiscal  stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal net cash of  was provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of net borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility and other long term debt  which provided the company with cash to open stores and to fund fiscal operations 
net cash of  was provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of net borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility  which provided the company with cash to open stores and to fund fiscal operations 
net cash of  was used in financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of the net repayments of the revolving credit facility and the mortgage loan facility  as well as the payment of capital lease obligations 
on august   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock at market prices 
the repurchase program authorizes purchases of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market or privately negotiated block transactions and contains no expiration date 
the authorization represented approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company as of august  as of february   the company had repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  average of per share 
in fiscal  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  most of which will be used to open approximately six new stores  and to remodel  re fixture  expand and relocate existing stores  and invest in information technology 
the company s liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future are expected to be met principally through the use of its credit facilities and through cash provided by operations 
in addition  the company plans to reduce working capital needs by  among other things  reducing expenses and by minimizing its capital expenditures 
if deemed by management to be in the best interest of the company  additional long term debt  equity  capital leases  or other permanent financing may be considered 
risk factors terrorism and the uncertainty of war may affect the company s business terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington dc on september   the response by the united states initiated on october  and other acts of violence or war may affect the market on which the company s common stock trades  the markets in which the company operates and the company s operations and profitability 
since the september attacks  the company has experienced sluggish demand for apparel in its stores located in the united states along the border with mexico and in other areas whose local economies are heavily dependent upon tourism 
management can provide no assurance that demand in these areas will improve during fiscal the potential near term and long term effects that any future terrorist attacks may have for the company s customers  the market for its common stock  the markets for its products and the united states economy are uncertain 
the consequences of any terrorist attack  or any armed conflicts which may result  are unpredictable  and management is unable to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on the company s markets or its business 
the company faces significant competition the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace 
the company competes with large discount retail chains such as wal mart  kmart  and target  and with off price chains  such as tj maxx  aj wright  ross stores  factory u stores and marshall s  some of which have substantially greater resources than its own 
the company also competes with independent and small chain retailers which serve the same low and middle income market 
in the future  new companies may also enter the deep discount retail industry 
although management believes that the company is well positioned to compete in its markets  management cannot assure that the company will be able to compete successfully against its current and future competitors 
in fiscal  the company experienced one of the toughest promotional environments in recent history 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business  which is a highly competitive environment that subjects it to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from lower net sales and reduced margins 
management expects that competition will continue and increase in the future 
the company has started new merchandise strategies  including concentrating on its core apparel and accessories categories  better execution of its core businesses and broader methods of marketing its business  all designed to improve gross margin  customer frequency and attract new customers 
however  management can make no assurances that these merchandising and marketing strategies and other actions taken will improve results or be adequate to minimize the company s exposure to any negative impacts due to competition 
the company s improvement in operating results depends on improvement in net sales and gross margin the company s improvement in operating results depends largely on its ability to improve net sales and gross margin 
to that end  during fiscal  the company will seek to focus its resources on its core merchandise categories of women s and children s apparel and women s accessories 
within these core merchandise categories  management believes that plus size women s apparel  children s apparel and women s accessories offer the most potential to increase net sales and gross margin 
to achieve this  the company has increased the square footage devoted to these categories in many of its stores 
the company will seek to improve its gross margin in existing stores by focusing its resources on higher margin  faster turning apparel categories and by increasing  as proportions of its total merchandise offerings  accessories and its own brands of merchandise 
opening new stores  expanding existing stores and relocating existing stores affects the company s business the company reduced the number of new store openings during fiscal as compared with prior years  and anticipates opening approximately six new stores during fiscal the reduced number of new store openings is designed to allow management to increase its focus on the management of existing stores  including concentrating on opportunities to expand and relocate existing stores in proven locations 
the company plans to relocate or expand approximately stores during fiscal the company continues to increase the number of its bestprice kids stores  which it has tested  by converting suitable existing stores into the bestprice kids concept and by creating its bestprice kids concept in a selected number of its larger stores 
the company has also developed a bestprice plus store concept which provides a wide assortment of plus size apparel and accessories 
the company experienced encouraging early indicators while testing this concept in several of its larger stores and this concept will be a part of the company s new tri box store concept  opening this spring 
these tri box stores will be approximately  to  square feet  will be located in densely populated areas and will contain three separate stores within a single store 
the center of tri box stores will include a wide assortment of the company s misses and junior sizes of women s apparel as well as accessories 
the other sections of the tri box stores will be merchandised as bestprice kids and bestprice plus stores 
there can be no assurance that the company s store development efforts will result in operating improvement in the company s existing store base 
the company s store development strategy depends on many factors  including its ability to identify suitable markets and sites for new  expanded and relocated stores  negotiate leases with acceptable terms  appropriately upgrade its financial and management information systems and controls and manage its operating expenses 
in addition  the company must be able to continue to hire  train  motivate and retain competent managers and store personnel 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
as a result  management cannot assure that the company will be able to achieve its future store development goals 
any failure by the company to achieve its store development goals on a timely basis  continue to enjoy acceptance in its current markets  attract and retain management and other qualified personnel  appropriately upgrade its financial and management information systems and control or manage operating expenses could adversely affect its future operating results and its ability to execute its store development strategy 
management also cannot assure that the company s store development strategy will improve its results of operations 
a variety of factors are critical to the success of the company s new  expanded and relocated stores and such factors include but are not limited to store sales  store location  store size  lease terms  initial advertising effectiveness and brand recognition 
assuming that its store development strategy occurs as anticipated  the company s store base will include a number of large stores including new  expanded and relocated locations with relatively short operating histories 
management cannot assure that such large stores will achieve the sales per selling square foot and store contributions currently achieved in the company s existing store base 
if the company s large stores on average fail to achieve its minimum operational performance criteria  its store development strategy could produce a decrease in its overall sales per selling square foot and store contributions 
increases in advertising and pre opening expenses associated with the opening of new stores could also contribute to a decrease in the company s operating results 
planned changes to and disruptions in distribution of merchandise could impact the company s business the company s success depends upon whether its receiving and shipping schedules for merchandise are well organized and managed 
the company is planning for an increased level of purchases of pre ticketed and pre packaged merchandise from vendors which it believes will reduce the handling costs associated with distributing merchandise to its stores 
however  management can make no assurances that these plans will provide the company with the planned efficiencies 
in addition  the company may face unexpected demands on its distribution operations that could cause delays in delivery of merchandise from its distribution center to its stores 
a fire  earthquake or other disaster at the company s distribution center could hurt its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company maintains commercial property  business interruption  earthquake and flood insurance to minimize the potential financial impact of these risks 
relationships with the company s vendors and the availability of in season merchandise affect its business the company s success depends in large part on its ability to locate and purchase quality merchandise at attractive prices on acceptable terms 
management cannot be certain that such merchandise will continue to be available in the future on acceptable terms 
further  the company may not be able to find and purchase merchandise in quantities necessary to accommodate its planned growth 
although management believes that the company s relationships with its vendors are good  the company does not have long term agreements with any vendor 
as a result  the company must continuously seek out buying opportunities from its existing suppliers and from new sources 
the company competes for these opportunities with other retailers  discount and deep discount chains and mass merchandisers 
although the company does not depend on any single vendor or group of vendors and believes it can successfully compete in seeking out new vendors  a disruption in the availability of merchandise at attractive prices and acceptable terms could impair its business 
the company s business is subject to seasonality the company has historically realized its highest levels of sales and income during the first and second quarters of its fiscal year the quarters ending in april and july because of heavy sales associated with the easter and mother s day holidays 
any adverse events during the first and second quarter could therefore affect the company s financial performance 
historically  the company has realized a significant portion of its net sales and net income during these two quarters 
in anticipation of the easter and mother s day holidays  the company may purchase substantial amounts of seasonal merchandise 
if for any reason the company s net sales during these seasons were to fall below seasonal norms and or its expectations  a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result 
if such an imbalance were to occur  markdowns might be required to clear excess inventory 
the company s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by higher than expected markdowns 
the company s business is vulnerable to economic factors beyond its control the company s ability to provide quality merchandise at everyday low prices could be hindered by certain economic factors beyond its control  including but not limited to o increases in inflation  o increases in operating costs  o increases in employee health care and workers compensation costs  o increases in prevailing wage levels  o increases in the minimum wage rate  both at the federal and state levels  and o decreases in consumer confidence levels 
the market price of the company s common stock has experienced substantial fluctuation the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated substantially over the last several years 
trading prices for its common stock could fluctuate significantly due to many factors  including o the depth of the market for the company s common stock  o changes in expectations of the company s future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  o variations in the company s operating results  o conditions or trends in the company s industry  o additions or departures of key personnel  and o future sales of the company s common stock 
among the company s contractual obligations are operating leases for its stores which typically contain five year terms with options to renew for additional five year periods 
the company also has operating leases for automobiles  trucks  trailers and certain computer and other equipment with one to ten year terms 
in addition  the company has certain capital leases for certain office equipment and computer software 
the company s credit facilities contain a term loan and mortgage loan with required payment provisions 
future minimum commitments as of february  are as follows other operating fiscal year store leases leases capital leases term loan mortgage loan total thereafter    total       the company also has a revolving credit agreement which expires in july with an outstanding balance of  and outstanding letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventories totaling approximately  at february  market risk and risk management policies the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting its credit arrangements  including a variable rate revolving credit agreement  a fixed rate term loan and a fixed rate mortgage loan agreement  which may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 
the company seeks to minimize its interest rate risk through its day to day operating and financing activities 
the company does not engage in speculative or derivative financial or trading activities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse change increase in interest rates relating to the company s revolving credit agreement for fiscal and fiscal would have increased pre tax loss by approximately  and  for the respective time periods 
due to the fixed rate nature of the term loan agreement  a hypothetical basis point adverse change decrease in interest rates would have increased the estimated fair value of the company s term loan agreement by approximately  at february   but would have had no effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows for fiscal the company had no term loan at february  due to the fixed rate nature of the mortgage loan agreement  a hypothetical basis point adverse change decrease in interest rates would have increased the estimated fair value of the company s mortgage loan agreement by approximately  and  at february  and february   respectively  but would have had no effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows for fiscal and fiscal effect of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which  as amended  was effective for the company s fiscal year beginning february  this new standard requires recognition of all derivatives  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the adoption of sfas on february  had no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning february  the company is evaluating the effect of the adoption of sfas  effective on february   and has not yet determined the effect  if any  that the adoption will have on the company s consolidated financial statements
