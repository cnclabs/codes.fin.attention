item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook the company attained record earnings of per diluted share in despite volatile interest rates  an economic slowdown  and the attacks on the us in september the federal reserve board cut the federal funds rate a record times during  leading to some of the lowest short term interest rates in decades  and dramatically changing the slope of the treasury yield curve 
the company remained focused on its core businesses in  namely attracting deposits  originating mortgage loans  and enhancing its earnings stream with increased fee income 
highlights for are as follows 

the company completed its acquisition of mid town in november mid town  with million in assets  and in deposits added branches within the city of chicago limits  complementing locations from previous acquisitions  as well as allowing the bank to enter lakefront markets on chicago s north side 

the bank originated a record billion in mortgage loans in response to a dramatic increase in refinance activity due to a decline in long term interest rates in the second half of the year 
the long term rates initially fell due to the slowing us economy and continued to fall after the attacks on the us in september 
the record loan production was nearly fixed rate  or billion  which led to the bank selling a record billion of mortgage loans into the secondary market as part of its long term strategy of managing its interest rate risk by selling long term fixed rate mortgages 
sales netted a profit of million in  compared to million in 
through a increase in the number of checking accounts  the bank increased fee income by to million in 
despite a slowing us economy  the housing market remained relatively firm during  and the company s land development operations posted record earnings of million in  primarily from income from the company s tallgrass of naperville residential project 
given the current state of the us economy  and expected economic recovery in the second half of  and assuming the current interest rate environment continues  the company expects modest increases in loans receivable and improved net interest margin over the balance of the year 
based on this  coupled with expected continued strong results from its real estate development operations  and giving effect to full cost savings benefits relating to mid town for the remainder of the year  the company is currently projecting results for in the range of per diluted share 
acquisitions and expansion activity the company s acquisitions and branch purchases during the past three years are listed as follows intangibles selling entity transaction date completed deposits loans recorded in thousands mid town bancorp acquisition november    m i bank  fsb branch purchases april    northern trust company branch purchase september   as it has in recent years  the company expects to continue to search for and evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that will enhance franchise value and may periodically be presented with opportunities to acquire other institutions  branches or deposits in the market it serves  or which allow the company to expand outside its current primary market areas of dupage county and the city of chicago 
management intends to review acquisition opportunities across a variety of parameters  including the potential impact on its financial condition as well as its financial performance in the future 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions  if any  will likely be valued at a premium to book value  and many times at a premium to current market value 
as such  management anticipates that acquisitions made by the company may include some book value per share dilution and earnings per share dilution for the company s shareholders depending on the company s success in integrating the operations of businesses acquired and the level of cost savings and revenue enhancements that may be achieved 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements found in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements require that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expense  as well as related disclosures of contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  market trends  and other information available to management 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that reduces net interest income to provide a reserve against estimated losses in the bank s loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the reserves needed to cover probable losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
in determining an adequate level of loss reserves  management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the allowance based on the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the bank capitalizes the estimated value of mortgage servicing rights upon the sale of loans 
the bank s estimated value takes into consideration contractually known amounts  such as loan balance  term  contract rate  and whether the customer escrows funds with the bank for the payment of taxes and insurance 
these estimates are impacted by loan prepayment speeds  earnings on escrow funds  as well as the discount rate used to present value the cash flow stream 
subsequent to the establishment of this asset  management reviews the fair value of mortgage servicing rights on a quarterly basis 
changes in these estimates impact fair value  and could require the bank to record a valuation allowance  as it did for  in should estimates assumed by management regarding future prepayment speeds on the underlying loans supporting the mortgage servicing rights prove to be incorrect  additional valuation allowances could occur  or contrarily  valuation allowances could be recovered if estimates increase the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
real estate held for development 
profits from lot sales in the company s real estate developments are based on cash received less the cost of sales per lot that usually includes an estimate of future costs to be incurred 
this is especially true at the outset of a project  where few actual costs have been incurred 
the estimate of total project costs is reviewed on a quarterly basis by project management 
estimates are subject to change for various reasons  including the length of the project  changes in rules or requirements of the communities where the projects reside  soil and weather conditions  as well as the general level of inflation 
changes in future estimated costs are recognized in the period of change as either a charge or an addition to income from real estate operations 
net income net income for the company was million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended december   an increase of over the prior year s net income of million  or per diluted share per basic share and million  or per diluted share per basic share for the year ended december  earnings for include a million pre tax gain  or 
per diluted share  related to the bulk sale of mortgage servicing rights 
excluding this gain  diluted earnings per share for grew over net interest income net interest income is the principal source of earnings for the company  and consists of interest income on loans receivable and mortgage backed and investment securities  offset by interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income fluctuates due to a variety of reasons  most notably due to the size of the balance sheet  changes in interest rates  and to a lesser extent asset quality 
the company seeks to increase net interest income without materially mismatching maturities of the interest earning assets it invests in compared to the interest bearing liabilities that fund such investments 
generally  the bank is able to increase net interest income at a faster pace when the spread between short term and long term interest rates is positive  due to funding costs being more directly tied to shorter term rates  while loans are tied to intermediate to longer term rates 
during  the us treasury yield curve went through a dramatic change from in both the general level of interest rates and the spread between short term and long term interest rates 
in  the bank operated in an interest rate environment that had shrinking to negative spreads between short and long term interest rates  which put pressure on its cost of funds  and narrowed spreads on arm loans 
by the end of  the us treasury yield curve was inverted between the month treasury bill and year treasury note by basis points 
beginning in early  with the slowing of the us economy  the federal reserve board began aggressively lowering its target federal funds rate in an effort to stimulate the economy 
these cuts were exacerbated by the attacks on the us in september by the end of  the slope in the us treasury yield curve between the month treasury bill and year treasury note was basis points 
the impact on the bank s net interest income in was a combination of a decrease in the cost of core deposits  such as passbooks  money markets  and now accounts  the downward repricing of maturing certificates of deposits  the downward repricing of arm loans  as well as shift in loan origination activity towards long term fixed rate mortgages 
loan prepayments and sales soared with the drop in mortgage rates  and slowed the growth of the bank s loan portfolio 
however  the deposit inflows  coupled with the slower loan growth  allowed the bank to reduce its reliance on higher cost advances from the fhlb of chicago 
the overall impact of these effects was a relatively flat net interest margin for  when compared to average balance sheets the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of financial condition and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense  on a tax equivalent basis  by the average balance of assets or liabilities

interest income on loans receivable increased million in to million when compared to in  the basis point decline in the average yield on loans receivable was offset by a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable 
this growth rate in loans receivable was below the levels recorded in recent years  due to heavy refinance activity during the second half of  as prepayments and sales of fixed rate loans both increased dramatically 
the decline in average yield was due in part to these same prepayments  as well as the downward repricing of arm loans during the year 
during  loan income increased million  to million  as average balances increased million  and the average yield on loans increased basis points 
loan growth in was attributable to higher overall interest rates leading to more arm loan originations that the bank held in portfolio 
interest income from mortgage backed securities decreased in to million  from million in  and million in the decline in mortgage backed securities income is primarily due to the decline in the average yield  as many of the bank s investments are in shorter term  adjustable rate securities  which repriced downward in due to sharply falling short term interest rates 
the bank purchased million in mortgage backed securities in late  to invest funds received from heavy prepayments and sales of fixed rate originations 
in previous years  when loan originations and lower prepayments allowed for growth in the bank s loan portfolio  fewer funds were allocated to the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
interest income from investment securities increased million  or in to million  while increasing million  or in and  or million in in  the average balance of investments grew by million in response to heavy loan prepayments and sales leading to higher available levels of cash 
the bank deployed this cash into investment securities such as corporate debt securities  bank trust preferred securities  preferred stock  and asset backed securities  as well as investment in the stock in the fhlb of chicago 
the average yield on investment securities declined basis points during during  the increase in income compared to was primarily due to increases in the investment in fhlb stock 
interest income from federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits decreased million in to million  while increasing million in  from million in the average balance of liquid investments were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decline in is primarily due to lower short term interest rates as a result of decreases in the federal funds rate  while in the increase in income was predominately due to higher average balances of liquidity 
interest expense on deposits increased by million to million in  due to an increase in average balances of million  offset by a decrease in the average cost of deposits of basis points 
the bank experienced strong deposit inflows during  even in the wake of falling interest rates  as consumers looked for safer investments in response to a weak stock market  and the uncertainty of world events 
the decline in the average cost of deposits was due to the maturing of higher coupon certificates of deposits  as well as a decrease in the rates paid on the banks core deposits 
in  when interest rates were generally rising  the average cost of deposits rose basis points  while average deposits grew million to billion  of which million was attributable to branch acquisitions 
higher costs were generally attributable to certificates of deposits  as well as a new higher rate money market product offered 
interest expense on deposits grew million to million in compared to million in interest expense on borrowed funds decreased million to million in  while increasing million in to million  compared to million in average borrowings decreased million in  while the average cost declined basis points 
the decline in average balance is due to slower loan growth  as well as deposit inflows  which both allowed the bank to repay  instead of refinancing  certain maturing fhlb of chicago advances throughout in  the average balance of borrowings increased million in conjunction with the bank increasing its loans receivable portfolio 
the low interest rate environment  coupled with the current positive slope in the treasury yield curve  is expected to have a modest improved impact on the bank s net interest margin during although short term rates are not expected to decline further  maturing certificates of deposit continue to reprice lower  as well as maturing advances from the fhlb of chicago 
additionally  management expects moderate loan growth in  as customers are expected to slowly move toward arm loans 
management anticipates that this loan growth will be at more favorable net interest spreads than in past years 
provision for loan losses a provision for loan losses is recorded as necessary to maintain a loan loss reserve management considers adequate to provide coverage for probable losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of in  compared to million in  and million in net charge offs were   and  in  and  respectively 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and determining  if any  the related provision for loan losses  management considers subjective factors  including local and general economic business factors and trends  portfolio concentrations and changes in the size and or general terms of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  which has ranged from to basis points as a percentage of outstanding loans over the past five years  and specific allocations based upon probable losses identified during the review of the portfolio 
at december   the bank s allowance for loan losses was million  or of non performing loans and 
of total loans  compared to million  or of non performing loans and 
of total loans at december  the bank added million to its loan loss reserve with the acquisition of mid town 
non interest income non interest income is another significant source of revenue for the company 
it consists of fees earned on products and services  gains and losses from asset sale activity and income from real estate operations 
although changes in interest rates can have an impact on revenues from these sources  the impact is generally less than the impact on net interest income 
non interest income was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the table below shows the composition of non interest income for the periods indicated 
percentage year ended december  increase decrease in thousands gain loss on sale of assets loans receivable    mortgage backed securities investment securities  foreclosed real estate n a loan servicing rights  income from real estate operations    total gain on sale of assets and income from real estate operations    deposit account service charges    brokerage commissions    mortgage loan related fees    loan servicing fee income expense   n a valuation allowance recovery of mortgage servicing rights bank owned life insurance    insurance commissions safe deposit box fees title agency fees real estate owned operations  net other    gain on sale of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank recorded a net gain on the sale of loans receivable of million in  compared to million in  and million in loan sales were billion  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
sales in the current year were driven by the high level of fixed rate loan originations made due to falling interest rates 
the company believes that during  interest rates will stabilize  decreasing the percentage of long term fixed rate loan originations  thereby reducing sales volumes and gains in compared to the amounts recorded in the  loss on mortgage backed securities in is the result of a sale of a million floating rate cmo which was more appropriate for a positively sloped yield curve environment 
the security was sold to redeploy the proceeds into higher yielding assets 
gains and losses on loans receivable include gains and losses from the sale of loans originated by the bank and swapped into mortgage backed securities prior to sale 
the bank swapped and sold million in compared to million in  and million in the decision to sell swaps versus whole loans to fnma or fhlmc is based primarily on price differences at the time of sale  and sales are executed in the manner that maximizes profit to the bank 
the bank has generally held few of these mortgage backed securities relating to loans that it originated and swapped in its portfolio 
gain on sale of investment securities 
the company had net gains on the sale of investment securities of  in  compared to  in  and million in net gains in these periods have been generated primarily from the sale of equity securities 
during  the gains generated were from the sales of equity and corporate debt securities 
during management elected to sell portions of its equity holdings in light of market conditions  as well as generate funds for its stock buyback program 
income from real estate operations 
income from real estate operations was million in  million in and million in  related to the projects shown below year ended december  lots income lots income lots income sold loss sold loss sold loss dollars in thousands tallgrass of naperville    woodbridge  hannaford farm reigate woods harmony grove creekside of remington ashbury the lot tallgrass of naperville project concluded its third straight year of solid lot sales  with lots sales generating million in income for average profit margins on sales in this project have steadily increased since due to the high demand for lots in this area driving up lot prices  while construction costs have remained stable compared to original estimates 
to date  lots have been sold  and an additional lots are under contract at december  tallgrass also has acres of commercially zoned land  as well as acres zoned multi family 
management currently expects continued strong lot sales in tallgrass during  and  including the expected bulk sales of the commercial and multi family acreage  expects pre tax income from real estate development in the range of million 
in  the bank sold its final two commercial parcels in the woodbridge subdivision 
one parcel was sold to the bank  with no profit recognized  that will be used for a future branch site in profits in and also represent sales of commercial properties in woodbridge 
the  profit recognized in the hannaford farm project represents a gain from the sale of undeveloped land after the company decided not to develop this parcel into residential lots when it did not get the desired zoning for this project 
the reigate woods  harmony grove  creekside of remington and ashbury projects were all completed in previous years 
deposit account service charges 
deposit account service charges increased to million in  compared to million in  and million in the primary source of these fees is from checking account charges for non sufficient funds  service charges  sustained overdraft fees  debit card usage  and automated teller machine services 
increases are a function of a higher number of checking accounts  new fees charged for services  as well as increases in existing fee schedules 
the number of checking accounts maintained by the bank was  exclusive of mid town   and  at december    and  respectively 
based on the addition of approximately  checking accounts from the mid town acquisition  as well as fee increases instituted by the bank as of january   management anticipates that deposit account service charges will grow by to in brokerage commissions 
through the bank s affiliation with invest  the bank offers non traditional investment products to its customers such as mutual funds  annuities and other brokerage services 
commission revenue increased slightly to million in  compared to million in  and million in flat revenues in are attributable to less than favorable equity markets and consumer desire for less risky investments  especially in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the us in september the decline in revenue in was attributable to broker turnover  stock market declines  as well as competition for brokerage services from discount and internet brokerage companies 
mortgage loan related fees 
mortgage loan related fees include late charge income on loans owned and serviced by the bank  inspection fee income for construction loans and loan modification income for refinance transactions 
income from these sources was million in  million in and million in the increase in was due to the high levels of refinance activity that the bank was able to direct to its modification department 
in lieu of a full refinance transaction  the bank  for a fee  will modify certain contractual terms of a customer s loan 
the bank treats the modified loan as if it was paid off  and amortizes any remaining deferred fees or expenses as interest income 
the primary reason for the decrease in compared to was the reduction of refinancings in due to higher interest rates 
with the recent stabilizing interest rate environment  management expects fee income from loan modifications to be lower in compared to the current year 
loan servicing fee income expense 
loan servicing fee income was a loss of  in  compared to income of million in  and million in despite an increase in the average balance of loans serviced for others during  the bank recorded a loss for the year  as accelerated amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights due to higher than estimated prepayments more than offset loan servicing fees earned 
in addition to the expense recognized  a valuation allowance was recorded in for a total of  the decline in compared to was primarily due to a lower average balance of loans serviced for others in  due to a bulk sale of approximately million in servicing rights in during  the bank also recorded a  recovery of a previously recorded impairment to servicing rights valuation allowance 
the average balance of loans serviced for others was billion  billion  and billion for the years ended december    and  respectively 
management currently expects long term mortgage rates to stabilize in  leading to slower prepayments in its loans serviced for others portfolio 
as a result  management expects loan servicing fee income in to exceed income from bank owned life insurance 
the bank invested million in bank owned life insurance boli to help fund the cost of certain employee benefit plan expenses 
the bank s boli investment consists of the purchase of life insurance on the lives of certain employees from an insurance carrier with a standard and poors rating of aa 
the company is the sole beneficiary of the life insurance policies 
income is recorded on this investment based on increases in the cash surrender value csv of the life insurance policies 
to the benefit of the company  this income is free from income taxes 
death benefits paid to the company will be revenue in the periods received  if any 
in  csv income recognized on these life insurance policies totaled million compared to million in  and million in title agency fees 
the bank offers limited title search services  primarily on refinance transactions  as agent 
income from this service is generated on a loan by loan basis  and totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the large increase in is directly related to the increase in refinance activity in due to falling interest rates 
similarly  the decline in income in compared to was due to less refinance activity in the loan originations compared to other non interest income 
other non interest income includes various other fees charged to customers for money orders  savings bonds  travelers checks  wire transfers  as well as the preferred return on limited partnership investments in residential real estate projects 
the primary reason for the increase in other income in was due to additional limited partnership investments made in non interest expense non interest expense was million in  million in and million in the table below shows the composition of non interest expense for the periods indicated 
percentage year ended december  increase decrease in thousands compensation    employee benefits    total compensation and benefits    occupancy expense    furniture  fixture and equipment expense    advertising and promotion    data processing    federal deposit insurance premiums  amortization of goodwill    amortization of core deposit intangible    other expenses professional fees    stationery  brochures and supplies    postage    telephone    ots assessment fees correspondent banking services atm network fees insurance costs other    total other expenses    compensation expense 
compensation expense was million in  compared to million in and million in increases in are attributable to numerous factors  including a full year of operations at two branches purchased in  the start up of the bank s business banking unit  increased loan department and secondary market department compensation due to record loan origination and sale volumes  as well as normal salary increases 
the increase in compared to was due in part to branch acquisitions in as well as normal salary increases 
employee benefits expense 
employee benefits expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase is due to higher medical expense  employer taxes  and retirement plan contributions 
the  increase in compared to is primarily attributable to increased medical expense of  as well as a  increase in the bank s contribution to its esop and profit sharing plans 
occupancy and equipment expense 
occupancy expenses increased  or  during due to increased operating costs related to a full year expense from the previous year s branch acquisitions  current year branch purchases  as well as higher real estate taxes throughout the bank s branch network 
occupancy expenses increased  between and primarily due to rent expense related to the bank s centralized loan processing center 
advertising and promotion expense 
advertising and promotion expenses increased  to million in  compared to million in the primary reason for the increase is higher newspaper and billboard advertising expenses related to the bank s efforts in promoting its brand recognition strategy 
this advertising initiative began in may and is also the primary reason for a  increase in advertising and promotion expense in compared to data processing expense 
data processing expenses increased slightly to million in  compared to million in  and million in the bank maintains its own data processing capability  and costs relate primarily to depreciation of equipment and communication costs for data transmission between branch locations  as well as the company s network 
fdic insurance expense 
fdic insurance increased  to  in  due to slightly larger average deposit balances in compared to we expect this expense to increase in due to higher average deposits following the mid town acquisition 
the  decrease in expense in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in its insurance assessment rate effective january  the bank has paid the lowest rate allowed by regulation for savings institutions over the past three years and expects to continue to qualify for the lowest rate 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill increased  to million in  primarily due to the bank s branch purchases in amortization of goodwill in increased  from primarily due to a branch purchase made in under statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 the company will cease amortizing goodwill on past acquisitions  in addition to not amortizing the goodwill created in the acquisition of mid town 
as such  management expects amortization of goodwill to decrease by approximately million to  in the continued amortization relates to prior branch purchases 
amortization of core deposit intangible 
amortization of core deposit intangibles was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the bank recognizes a core deposit intangible in any bank or branch acquisition transaction  and amortizes it on an accelerated method over years 
other non interest expense 
other non interest expense includes costs such as stationary and supplies  postage and telephone expenses incurred in the day to day operations of the company 
these costs totaled million in  compared to million in  and million in the increases in are primarily due to higher loan volume and expanded branch locations that added costs to the bank s operations  while the increases in were primarily related to branch additions in income taxes income tax expense was million in  effective income tax rate of compared to million in effective income tax rate of 
the higher effective income tax rate in the current year compared to a year ago was primarily the result of greater state income taxes in and the recognition in the prior period of income tax benefits relating to the resolution of certain prior years income tax issues 
income tax expense was million in  equal to an effective income tax rate of 
review of financial condition total assets increased million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at december   primarily due to the acquisition of mid town bancorp  which added million in total assets in november  and to a lesser extent an increase in the deposit balances of the bank 
management expects growth in total assets to moderately increase in  as prepayments in loans receivable are expected to slow  which should allow the bank s loan portfolio to expand with funding from either increased deposits  or borrowings 
cash  interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold decreased a combined million to million at december  although short term liquidity declined during  it remains relatively higher than normal due to high loan prepayments during the fourth quarter  limited alternatives for higher yielding short term investments and maturing fhlb of chicago advances in the first quarter of that management expects to repay 
at december   the balance of investment securities classified as available for sale grew to million from million at december  upon the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all million of the remaining investment securities previously classified as held to maturity were transferred into the bank s available for sale portfolio 
additionally  mid town s investment securities added approximately million to this portfolio as of the end of the year 
the bank has been increasing the amount of investment securities in its balance sheet as a means of reinvesting higher liquidity  as well as to help diversify interest rate risk from mortgage related cash flows 
the purchases during the current year were primarily investment grade corporate debt securities  bank trust preferred securities  preferred stock  as well as a limited amount of asset backed securities 
purchases totaled million in  while maturities were million 
this portfolio is carried at fair value  and had a cost basis of million at december  at december   the bank held million in stock in the fhlb of chicago  compared to million at december  of the increase  million is attributable to the acquisition of mid town 
over and above its required investment of stock in the fhlb of chicago  the bank  during  made a discretionary purchase of million of stock  seeking to enhance its overall yield of interest earning assets  as dividend rates over the past quarters have been well above the short term us treasury rates 
discretionary investments in the stock of the fhlb of chicago are able to be redeemed upon request at par value 
at december   mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale increased million to million 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 all million of the remaining mortgage backed securities previously classified as held to maturity were transferred into the bank s available for sale portfolio 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to a limited amount of purchases during the current year  as the low interest rate environment made it difficult to grow the bank s whole loan portfolio 
purchases of million consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities as well as cmos 
included in total mortgage backed securities at december  are million of cmo s with a weighted average life of years that are primarily collateralized by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent by whole loans 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities acquired and classified as available for sale represent a secondary source of liquidity to the bank and the company 
the market value of these securities fluctuates with interest rate movements 
net interest income in future periods may be adversely impacted to the extent interest rates increase and these securities are not sold with the proceeds reinvested at the higher market rates 
the decision whether to sell the available for sale securities or not  is based on a number of factors  including but not limited to projected funding needs  reinvestment alternatives and the relative cost of alternative liquidity sources 
investments and mortgage backed securities classified as held to maturity cannot be sold except under extraordinary and very restrictive circumstances 
generally  these investments are acquired for investment after taking into account the bank s cash flow needs  the investment s projected cash flows  the bank s overall interest rate and maturity structure of the liability base used to fund these investments and the net interest spread obtained 
loans receivable increased  or million to billion at december  the increase was due to the acquisition of mid town  which added approximately million of balances in november without the acquisition  total loans receivable declined approximately million due to heavy prepayments in the loan portfolio as loans were refinanced in the falling interest rate environment in the second half of the bank originated billion of mortgage loans during the current year 
this volume was more than offset by amortization and prepayments of billion  and sales of billion 
the loans sold represent primarily long term fixed rate mortgages that are sold as a means of limiting interest rate risk and generating gains on sale of loans and servicing fee income in the future 
loans held for sale increased to million at december  compared to million at december  due to the higher levels of fixed rate loan originations 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million as of december  the increase is due to the acquisition of mid town that had an allowance for loan losses of million  offset by net charge offs of  as of december   the bank s ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans was  compared to as of december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to 
at december   compared to 
at december  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate 
real estate held for development or sale increased  to million at december  a summary of real estate held for development or sale is as follows december  in thousands tallgrass of naperville   shenandoah   woodbridge the increase in the lot tallgrass of naperville project is primarily due to continued expenditures on development costs in the project during the current year 
the company sold lots during and has an additional lots under contract at december  the carrying value of tallgrass remained increased year over year due to continued development costs incurred in land for a new planned development of approximately lots in plainfield  illinois known now as the shenandoah project  was acquired in with development expected to begin in the decrease in the woodbridge project is due to the sales of the remaining two commercial parcels in this project 
the remaining three acres were sold during at approximately  of pre tax profit 
premises and equipment increased million to million at december  of the increase  approximately million was due to the acquisition of mid town 
the remainder of the increase was due to additions of million  and approximately million of these costs were for the construction of the new branch site in romeoville 
the additions were offset by depreciation and amortization of million 
the bank currently has plans to build seven new branch sites over the next few years 
foreclosed real estate decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  foreclosed real estate at december  consists of seven single family dwellings 
intangible assets increased million to million at december  the increase is due to the recording of goodwill and core deposit intangibles of million in conjunction with the acquisition of mid town offset by amortization of intangibles totaling million 
at december   the company has million of goodwill  including the million created in the acquisition of mid town  which will no longer be amortized under the new accounting rules promulgated by sfas no 
instead  this balance of goodwill will be subject to periodic impairment analysis in the future 
deposits increased million to billion as of december   or 
the acquisition of mid town added million to deposits in november additionally  the bank experienced strong inflows during the bank experienced a increase in money market accounts as a result of a well received competitively priced product  and in total increased its percentage of core deposits passbooks  money market and now accounts to total deposits to at december   compared to at december  borrowed funds decreased million  or  to billion at december  the reduction in borrowings is primarily attributable to slow asset growth  as loan prepayments held down the growth in loans receivable  as well as deposit inflows  which were used to fund the limited asset growth the bank incurred in as of december   the bank had billion of fhlb of chicago advances at a weighted average rate and term to maturity of and years  respectively  compared to billion at a weighted average rate and term to maturity of and years  respectively  as of december  of the fhlb advances at december   million of advances  with a weighted average term to maturity of years  contain various call provisions  with a weighted average term to call of years 
the calls are most likely exercised by the issuer in a period of rising interest rates  and at december  have terms making their early calls unlikely 
offsetting this decrease was an increase in the company s unsecured bank term loan and line of credit by a combined million  primarily due to the acquisition of mid town 
stockholders equity of the company grew to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in stockholders equity is primarily due to comprehensive income of million reflecting increased value on securities available for sale at december   and the issuance of million of common stock in the acquisition of mid town  offset by the repurchase of million of common stock and the payment of cash dividends of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal assets are its investments in the bank and mafd 
to the extent that it does not generate significant earnings outside of these subsidiaries  the company s liquidity position is primarily dependent on dividends from the bank and  to a lesser extent  dividends from mafd 
the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company is dependent on its ability to generate earnings  and to meet regulatory restrictions 
see item business regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation limitation on capital distributions for a detail of these restrictions 
the bank has not been restricted by these limitations in funding the necessary amounts needed by the company for its operations  and does not expect to be limited in the future 
at december   under current ots dividend regulations  the bank has million of retained earnings available for dividend declarations 
the company received million in dividends from the bank in  compared to million in  and million in in addition  in  the company received million in dividends from mafd 
the primary uses of funds at the company consist of principal and interest payments on borrowed funds  cash dividends  and stock repurchases 
the company has also funded loans to and investments in mafd from time to time 
to the extent the company has excess cash at any time  it will invest funds in investment securities  marketable equity securities or other interest earning assets

the purchase price of such shares totaled approximately million for shares purchased from allen koranda and  for shares purchased from ken koranda 
the terms of these private transactions were approved by the disinterested members of the board 
the sale of shares by allen koranda was related to his marital dissolution agreement 
the sale of shares by kenneth koranda was related to the satisfaction of various tax obligations and personal financial planning 
the company has used stock repurchase programs as a means of providing for future acquisitions  stock option exercises  and other general corporate purposes 
cash dividends paid to common shareholders totaled million

per share declared in the increase is primarily due to a increase in the cash dividend rate in compared to the most recent quarterly dividend of 
per share was paid on january  the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and depends on a variety of factors  including operating results  financial position  and the ability of the bank to pay dividends up to the holding company 
in january  the company announced a increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 
per share beginning with its next quarterly dividend payable in april the bank s principal sources of funds are deposits  advances from the fhlb of chicago  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of loans  investment securities  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturing interest bearing deposits are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  the general level of interest rates and competition 
the bank utilizes particular sources of funds based on comparative costs and availability 
cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income for the year  adjusted for items in net income that did not impact cash  as well as cash flow activity from mortgage banking activity 
the bank originated and purchased billion of loans for sale  and received billion in proceeds from sales and swaps during the bank had million of loans held for sale at december   up from million at december  the increase in loans held for sale is due to declining interest rates that have led to an increase in fixed rate loan originations 
most of these loans will be sold in the first quarter of cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of loans and investments acquired for the bank s interest earning asset portfolios  as well as cash flows from asset sales  real estate held for development activity and the impact of acquisitions 
cash provided by investing activities totaled a net million in  compared to a net use of million in during the current year  the bank originated and purchased billion of loans for investment  which were offset by billion of loan amortization and prepayments 
the higher prepayments led to available liquidity  which was used to purchase investment and mortgage backed securities  as well as to repay certain maturing borrowings 
cash flow from the company s land development operations was positive  as sales of property of million were offset by expenditures for land acquisition and development of million 
cash provided from financing activities for bank operations are primarily in the form of savings deposits  fhlb of chicago advances and to a lesser extent  reverse repurchase agreements 
cash provided from financing activities totaled a net million in  compared to million in during the current year net deposits increased million  and  coupled with minimal loan growth  allowed the bank to repay a net million of fhlb of chicago advances 
additionally  the acquisition of mid town led to a net increase in the company s unsecured term bank loan of million  offset by purchases of the company s stock totaling million and dividends to shareholders totaling million

additionally  its core deposits which do not have a stated contractual maturity  have generally been very stable over time  and are not expected to be redeemed in large amounts during as such  the scheduled billion of maturing certificates of deposits in  as well as the balances of core deposits are not expected to put a burden on the bank s cash needs 
the bank has the ability to refinance any advance coming due with the fhlb of chicago  which it will normally do in the course of business if its loan portfolio is growing 
should its loan portfolio growth be slower  due to prepayments in its loan portfolio  the bank will have adequate liquidity to repay its maturing advances 
the unsecured bank term loan and line of credit amounts are repaid through the normal course of business primarily through dividends from the bank 
net savings outflows  if any  as well as expected loan portfolio growth in could also be met by additional advances from the fhlb of chicago

these sources of funds change when arm originations are higher  at which time the bank will rely more on funding from the fhlb of chicago 
at december   the bank has approximately million of cash and liquidity  million of commitments to sell loans  as well as additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb of chicago 
these sources are also available for the funding of unused equity line of credits 
however  the bank does not expect all of these lines to be used based on historical levels of total lines used by its customers 
real estate development costs represent estimated future disbursements related to current and future planned projects and do not  in most cases  reflect contractual obligations at the present time 
real estate development costs are funded primarily by sales of previously developed lots  and to a lesser extent  borrowings from the company 
it is currently anticipated that cash flow from developed lots in inventory will cover the costs of land development in however  should lot sales of existing inventory slow  mafd would ultimately rely on borrowings from the company  who s funding capacity is limited to its unsecured bank line of credit  or additional dividends from the bank 
in addition  mafd would also be able to stop incurring development costs related to future units 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated information are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and gap analysis 
as part of its normal operations  the bank is subject to interest rate risk on the interest sensitive assets it invests in and the interest sensitive liabilities it borrows 
the bank s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the bank s asset liability management committee alco and the board of directors of the company 
the alco  which includes members of senior management  monitors the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the individual asset and liability portfolios the bank maintains and determines risk management strategies 
the bank utilizes an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship of maturing or repricing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time  and is usually analyzed at a period of one year 
generally  a negative gap  where more interest bearing liabilities are repricing or maturing than interest earning assets  would tend to result in a reduction in net interest income in a period of rising interest rates 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would likely result in an improvement in net interest income 
management s goal is to maintain its cumulative one year gap within the range of to 
the gap ratio fluctuates as a result of market conditions and management s expectation of future interest rate trends 
the bank s asset liability management strategy emphasizes the origination of one to four family adjustable rate loans and other loans which have shorter terms to maturity or reprice more frequently than fixed rate mortgage loans  yet provide a positive margin over the bank s cost of funds  for its own portfolio 
historically  the bank has generally sold its conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market in order to maintain its interest rate sensitivity levels 
during the eighteen to twenty four month period ended june   the bank had been retaining the majority of the non conforming  fixed rate originations and all of the prepayment protected fixed rate loan originations in portfolio for investment purposes to help utilize the bank s higher capital base resulting from the merger with northwestern 
these fixed rate loans were funded with intermediate to longer term fixed rate fhlb advances  some of which contained call options at the discretion of the fhlb of chicago 
the bank  except as noted below  has not used derivative financial instruments such as swaps  caps  floors  options or similar financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
however  in conjunction with its origination and sale strategy discussed above  management does hedge the bank s exposure to interest rate risk primarily by committing to sell fixed rate mortgage loans for future delivery 
under these commitments  the bank agrees to sell fixed rate loans at a specified price and at a specified future date 
the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans for future delivery has enabled the bank to continue to originate new mortgage loans  and to generate gains on sale of these loans as well as loan servicing fee income  while maintaining its gap ratio within the parameters discussed above 
most of these forward sale commitments are conducted with fnma  fhlmc and mpf with respect to loans that conform to the requirements of these government agencies 
the forward commitment of mortgage loans presents a risk to the bank if the bank is not able to deliver the mortgage loans by the commitment expiration date 
if this should occur  the bank would be required to pay a fee to the buyer 
the bank attempts to mitigate this risk by charging potential retail borrowers a fee to lock in the interest rate  or by requiring the interest rate to float at market rates until shortly before closing 
in addition  the bank uses us treasury bond futures contracts to hedge some of the mortgage pipeline exposure 
these futures contracts are used to hedge mortgage loan production in those circumstances where loans are not sold forward as described above 
the table on the next page sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the bank s assets and liabilities at december  the table uses management s assumptions regarding prepayment percentages on loans and mortgage backed securities  based on its current experience in these portfolios 
the bank uses the withdrawal assumptions used by the fhlb of chicago with respect to now  checking and passbook accounts  which are annual rates of     and  respectively 
investment securities and fhlb advances that contain call provisions at the option of the issuer or lender are generally shown in the category relating to their respective final maturities 
million of fhlb advances with final maturities in more than five years  but callable in calendar are categorized as million due in months or less  in anticipation of them being called 
the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest sensitive and may be repriced within each of the periods specified 
certain shortcomings are inherent in using gap analysis to quantify exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricings in the table  they may react differently to actual changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
this is especially true in circumstances where management has a certain amount of control over interest rates  such as the pricing of deposits 
additionally  certain assets such as hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
finally  as interest rates change  loan prepayment rates will differ from those rates assumed by management in the table 
although management believes that its asset liability management strategies mitigate the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the bank s operations  material and prolonged increases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s operations because the bank s interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice within one year are currently greater than the bank s interest earning assets which mature or reprice within the same period 
conversely  decreases in interest rates could benefit the bank s operation as maturing interest bearing liabilities are replaced at lower costs

represents forward commitments to sell long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
the bank s cumulative one year gap was a negative million or  of total assets at december   compared with a negative million or of total assets at december  during  the bank maintained its modest negative gap position  as higher prepayment speeds shortened the expected cash flows in the bank s loans receivable portfolio  which was offset by the acquisition and internally generated increases in core deposit accounts  primarily money market accounts  which increased million during net portfolio value analysis 
under ots thrift bulletin a  the bank is required to measure its interest rate risk assuming various increases and decreases in general interest rates  and the effect on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
the board of directors has established limits to changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income across a range of hypothetical interest rate changes 
if estimated changes to npv and net interest income are not within these limits  the board may direct management to adjust its asset liability mix to bring its interest rate risk within board limits 
at december   the bank was within the board approval limits 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the bank s interest rate risk by calculating the estimated change in the npv of its cash flows from interest sensitive assets and liabilities  as well as certain off balance sheet items  in the event of a series of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates ranging from to basis points 
management assumes that a basis point movement up or down is considered reasonable and plausible for purposes of reviewing its overall interest rate risk 
for its analysis at december   the down basis point analysis was excluded given the current low interest rate environment making that analysis meaningless 
npv is the market value of portfolio equity and is computed as the difference between the market value of assets and the market value of liabilities  adjusted for the value of off balance sheet items 
the table below shows the change in npv applying various rate shocks to the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  and estimated increase percentage increase change in estimated npv decrease in npv decrease in npv interest rate dollars in thousands basis point rise     basis point rise     base scenario   basis point decline     the bank s net portfolio value npv at december  increased million to million 
the increase is due to a million increase in the bank s stockholders equity  the emphasis on adding adjustable rate loans  primarily home equity lines of credit to the bank s loan portfolio  and the positive effect of the decreases in market interest rates during the current year 
the percentage decline in npv at the and basis point rise scenarios remained relatively constant between and the bank was able to maintain its interest sensitivity levels in  due to continued adherence to its policy of emphasizing adjustable rate or short term loans in its loan portfolio  as well as emphasizing growth in core deposit accounts  which become more valuable in a rising rate environment 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the bank 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities and operations
