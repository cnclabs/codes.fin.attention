item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under certain risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of systems  known as video storage servers  that automate the management and distribution of long form video streams  such as movies or other feature presentations  and short form video streams  such as advertisements 
we have three reportable segments broadband systems  broadcast systems and services 
the broadband systems segment includes products  such as our digital advertising and video on demand products  that digitally manage  store and distribute digital video for cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
the broadcast systems segment includes products for the storage  archival  on air playback of advertising and other video programming for the broadcast television industry 
our system revenues are comprised of sales of our broadband and broadcast systems 
the service segment is comprised of revenue related to product development contracts  installation  training  product maintenance and technical support for all of the above systems  and content which is distributed by the broadband product segment 
we have experienced fluctuations in our systems revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s obtaining authorized signatures on their purchase orders  budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  and the time required to produce and test the system before delivery 
because the average sales price of our system is high  the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in quarterly fluctuations in our revenue 
our results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including our pricing  the costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations 
we price our products and services based upon our costs as well as in consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined over time 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
we expect that the events of september th and their aftermath coupled with the already soft economy will continue to influence our operating results into fiscal this impact is likely to be most significant in the capital spending budgets of some of our cable and broadcast customers who we believe depend on advertising revenues to fund their equipment purchases 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of digital video arts  ltd 
in exchange for  shares of our common stock using an exchange ratio of of one share of our common stock for each share of digital video arts 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
digital video arts is a developer of custom software products specializing in digital video and interactive television 
as a result of the acquisition  digital video arts became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all the periods presented have been restated to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of digital video arts 
on january   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  consisting of  shares sold by us and  shares sold by certain of our stockholders 
proceeds to seachange  net of underwriting discounts and costs of the offering  were approximately million 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of those accounting policies that we believe are most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenues from sales of systems are recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
installation  project management and training revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from technical support and maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements  generally one year 
customers are billed for installation  project management  training and maintenance at the time of the product sale 
if a portion of the sales price is not due until installation of the system is complete  that portion of the sales price is deferred until installation is complete 
revenue from content fees  primarily movies  is recognized based on the volume of monthly purchases that are made by hotel guests 
revenue from product development contract services is recognized based on the time and materials incurred to complete the work 
shipping and handling costs are included in revenue and cost of revenues 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
systems sales always include at least one year of free technical support and maintenance services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training  project management  technical support and maintenance and content fees are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
the amount allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
installation  training and project management services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for transactions in which consideration  including equity instruments  is given to a customer  we account for the value of this consideration as a reduction in revenue in our statement of operations see further discussion under equity investments within management s discussion and analysis and footnote in the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue for systems and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
our normal payments terms are of the order due upon receipt of a customer purchase order  due upon shipment of the product to the customer and due days after shipment of the product to the customer 
our finance management regularly monitors timely payments from our customers and assesses any collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition but generally do not require collateral from our customers 
for a majority of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to operations within general and administrative expenses 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit assessment  detailed analysis of specific customer situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventories and reserves for obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components and subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
we depend upon certain vendors for the manufacture of significant components for all of our products 
if these vendors were to become unwilling or unable to manufacture these products in required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable alternative vendors 
the inability to develop alternative sources  if required in the future  could result in delays or reductions in product shipments and thereby adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing and finance management and operations personnel regularly monitor the inventories to ensure its carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventory for net realizable value 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when such an impairment is identified through the quarterly review process 
excess and obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand components and subassemblies and finished products  is written down to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost 
the excess and obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
valuation of long lived assets 
we defer legal costs associated with defending our existing patents 
if the patent defense is successful  the costs are capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over their estimated remaining useful life 
if the patent defense is unsuccessful  the amounts that have been deferred are charged to operating expense 
included in other assets at january  are deferred legal costs of million associated with on going litigation related to the ncube lawsuits 
at january   goodwill and intangibles consisted of  of net goodwill costs which will cease to be amortized beginning february  and net capitalized patent defense costs of million which are being amortized to general and administrative expenses over their four year estimated useful life 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas no 
the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger the impairment review include 
significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  
significant negative industry or economic trends  
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  
significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market  and 
our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
to date  no such impairment has been indicated 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
equity investments 
on december   we and comcast cable communications  inc entered into a video on demand purchase agreement for our interactive television video servers and related services 
under the terms of the video on demand purchase agreement  comcast has committed to purchase our equipment capable of serving a minimum of one million cable subscribers by approximately december in addition  comcast may earn up to an additional  incentive common stock purchase warrants through december based on the number of cable subscribers in excess of one million who are served by our equipment which has been purchased by comcast 
on february   we and comcast sc signed and closed a common stock and warrant purchase agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we sold in a private placement to comcast sc for approximately million an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
we determined the intrinsic value of  related to the  shares of common stock purchased on february  and measured the fair value of million related to the  common stock purchase warrants as of the closing date and recorded these amounts as contra equity 
on april   we recorded an additional contra equity amount of  for the fair value of the additional  common stock purchase warrants of our common stock as the registration statement had not been declared effective on or before march  in accordance with the agreement 
on june   the effective date of the registration statement  we issued an additional  common stock purchase warrants in accordance with the agreement  and recorded an additional contra equity amount of  representing the incremental fair value of the total warrants issued 
management determined the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes valuation model 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a weighted average volatility factor of  a dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  and an expected warrant term of years 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the warrants may have significantly changed  which could have materially impacted our results of operations 
the total contra equity amount of million is being amortized as an offset to gross revenue in proportion to the revenue recognized from the sale of equipment with respect to the first one million subscribers comcast has committed to under the video on demand purchase agreement 
we have estimated that the equipment value with respect to the first one million subscribers is million 
this estimate is continuously monitored and is subject to change 
to the extent that this estimate changes in the future  the amount of the remaining contra equity amount will be adjusted prospectively 
for the year ended january   we amortized million of the deferred equity discount 
as of january   the balance of the deferred equity discount was million 
the fair value of the additional incentive common stock purchase warrants will also be recorded as an offset to gross revenue as the warrants are earned by comcast  if any 
on november   we and visible world entered into a joint development and marketing agreement 
the purpose of the partnership is to integrate the advertising insertion product offerings that we offer with the software technologies of visible world  which would enable advertisers an end to end solution for providing target advertising to their customers 
the agreement is for a one year period with automatic annual renewal unless day notice of termination is given by either party 
in conjunction with the arrangement  visible world issued us a fully vested warrant to purchase one million shares of series b preferred stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires at the earlier of a the consummation of a qualified public offering  as defined in the agreement  by visible world  b the sale of visible world  as defined in the agreement or c years 
because the issuance of the warrant to us under the terms of the agreement is in exchange for services to be provided by us  the warrant is accounted for under the guidance of eitf  accounting by a grantee for an equity instrument to be received in conjunction with providing goods or services 
management determined the fair value of the warrant based on available financial information using the black scholes valuation model 
the assumptions used in this valuation included a fair value of visible world stock of per share  a weighted average volatility factor of  a dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  and an expected warrant term of years 
if management had used another valuation method or different valuation assumptions  the fair value of the warrant may have significantly changed 
we recorded the value of the warrant of  as a long term investment included in other assets with an offsetting amount included in deferred revenue 
we will recognize the deferred revenue over a five year period  the expected term of the services 
in addition  we review the carrying value of our investment on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment of the asset 
it is possible that changes in facts or circumstances related to the value of this investment could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial and tax accounting 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets is reduced 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
although realizability is not assured  based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that all remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
as a result of our operating profit in the year ended january   forecasted operating income for the year ended january  and the expectation of profitability in future periods thereafter  we did not record any additional valuation allowances during the year ended january  had we recorded an additional allowance  we would have reported materially different results 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if we do not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of potential acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  systems revenues 
our systems revenues consist of sales of our broadband and broadcast products 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended january   increased from million in to million in digital advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  interactive television systems revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended january  reducing interactive television systems revenue for the year ended january  was the amortization of million related to the deferred equity discount associated with the comcast equity investment 
the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the initial deployment of residential video on demand systems in the united states for cable operators  offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for digital advertising 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  the decrease in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures by broadcast companies that we believe is tied to declining advertising revenues earned by those companies 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our interactive television and broadcast system products as cable and telecommunications companies continue to offer new video on demand applications for their customers and the market for digital video servers within the broadcast industry continues to expand 
as revenues from broadcast and interactive television products increase  the digital advertising products will become a smaller portion of total system revenues 
however  we believe that there will be a continuing demand for expansions to existing digital advertising insertion systems within the united states 
services revenues 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  product maintenance  technical support services  project management  product development contracts and movie content fees 
our services revenues increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the renewals of technical support and maintenance services  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services  the impact of a growing installed base of systems and a higher level of product development services 
for the twelve month periods ended january  and january   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and  and of total revenues in the year ended january  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of large customers 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the twelve month periods ended january  and january   respectively 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
if this practice changes in the future  we will reevaluate our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended january  in the year ended january   the increase in costs of systems revenues reflects higher systems revenue and higher material costs within the interactive television products 
we expect cost of systems revenues for the interactive television products within the broadband segment to be higher as a percentage of revenues as the products are first deployed and to decrease as a percentage of revenues as the revenue level increases and we improve our manufacturing and material purchasing efficiencies 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the year ended january  and january   respectively 
the decrease in systems gross profit in the year ended january  was primarily due to the shift within the broadband segment from product sales of higher gross profit ad insertion systems to lower gross profit interactive television systems 
we expect this product sales shift to continue  however  we expect that gross profit for interactive television systems will improve as the revenue level for interactive television systems increases and we improve our manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies 
gross profit for the broadband segment decreased from for the year ended january  to for the year ended january  while gross profit for the broadcast segment decreased from to for the year ended january  and the year ended january   respectively 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services provided by us and costs associated with providing movie content 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january   primarily as a result of increased revenues and the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended january  improvements in the services gross profit in the year ended january  reflect the increase in the installed base of systems under maintenance  price increases on certain annual technical support and maintenance services and higher product development revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as we continue our development and support of new and existing products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel for our broadcast and interactive television products  increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher marketing expenses specifically for tradeshow and other promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at million in the year ended january  and january   respectively 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense  net  was approximately  in the year ended january  and interest expense  net  was approximately  in the year ended january  the increase in in interest expense  net  primarily resulted from interest expense on increased borrowings under our lines of credit and borrowings under our construction loan 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate was in the year ended january  the effective tax rate for the year ended january  was favorably impacted by the utilization of research and development tax credits 
we had net deferred tax assets of million at january  although realizability is not assured  based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that all remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term  and the amount could be material  if we do not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
any reduction of the amount of the deferred tax assets would reduce net income in the period in which the reduction occurs 
cumulative effect change in accounting principle 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended january   we implemented the sec s sab guidelines  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of february  historically  for some of our sales transactions  a portion of the sales price  typically  was not due until installation occurred 
we now defer revenue recognition on the portion of the sales price not due until installation is complete 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of  or per diluted share which has been included in income for the nine months ended october  year ended december  compared to the year ended january  systems revenues 
systems revenues increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the year ended january  and of total revenues in the year ended december   increased from million in to million in digital advertising system revenues were million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  interactive television systems revenues increased to million for the year ended january  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the sale of interactive television systems to us cable system operators who began to deploy residential video on demand services to their subscriber base during the year ended january   offset in part by a decline in the number of expansion systems purchased by united states cable system operators for digital advertising 
broadcast system segment revenues were million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in broadcast revenues for the year ended january  was primarily due to shipments for new broadcast customers in the united states  europe and the far east 
services revenues 
our services revenues increased to million in year ended january  from million in the year ended december  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the renewals of existing technical support and maintenance  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services  the impact of a growing installed base of systems and a higher volume of product development services 
for the twelve month periods ended january  and december   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the year ended january  and and of total revenues in the year ended december  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of large customers 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the twelve month periods ended january  and december   respectively 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the year ended january  as compared to million in the year ended december  in the year ended january   the cost of systems revenues increased from the prior year primarily as a result of higher systems revenues 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the year ended january  and december   respectively 
the increase in systems gross profit in the year ended january  was primarily due to lower material and other manufacturing costs as a percentage of systems revenue within the broadband segment and specifically for system revenues for the digital advertising insertion products 
we were able to reduce manufacturing material costs principally through improved purchasing methods despite the continued trend towards the purchase of smaller scale digital advertising insertion systems and expansions to existing systems that have higher material content 
gross profit for the broadband segment improved from for the year ended december  to for the year ended january  while gross profit for the broadcast segment was and for the year ended january  and the year ended december   respectively 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended january   primarily as a result of increased revenues and the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the year ended january  and in the year ended december  improvements in the services gross profit in the year ended january  reflect the increase in the installed base of systems under maintenance  price increases on certain annual technical support and maintenance services and higher product development revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel for our broadcast and interactive television products  increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher marketing expenses specifically for tradeshow and other promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses associated with various litigation matters and accounting expenses associated primarily with tax matters 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense  net  was approximately  in the year ended january  and interest income  net  was approximately  in the year ended december  the increase in in interest expense  net  primarily resulted from interest expense on increased borrowings under our lines of credit and new borrowings under our construction loan 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended january  differed from the us federal statutory tax rate due to the utilization of research and development tax credits 
our effective tax benefit rate was for the year ended january  as compared to for the year ended december  one month ended january  compared to the one month ended january  systems revenues 
systems revenues decreased from  in the one month ended january  to  in the one month ended january  this decreased systems revenues resulted primarily from the timing of receipt of customer orders and related shipment within both the broadband and broadcast segments 
services revenues 
our services revenues increased from approximately million in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january  this increase in services revenues resulted primarily from renewals of technical support and maintenance contracts  higher product development revenues and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
for the one month period ended january  and january   certain customers accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers accounted for and of total revenues in the one month ended january  and  and of total revenues in the one month ended january  revenues from these customers were primarily in the broadband segment 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the one month ended january  and january   respectively 
systems gross profit 
costs of systems revenues decreased from  in the one month ended january  to  in the one month ended january  for the one month ended january   the decrease in cost of systems revenues primarily reflects lower systems revenue offset in part by fixed manufacturing labor and overhead costs 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was a negative in the one month ended january  in the one month ended january   gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was 
the decrease in systems gross profit in was primarily due to lower systems revenue and higher material and fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of systems revenues 
services gross profit 
costs of services revenues increased from approximately million in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january   primarily as a result of the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue decreased to in the one month ended january  compared to a gross profit margin of in the one month ended january  research and development 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million  in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from  in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january  this increase is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel for our broadcast and interactive television products and higher tradeshow expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in the one month ended january  to  in the one month ended january  interest income  net 
interest income  net  was approximately  in the one month ended january  and january   respectively 
benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate was and in the one month ended january  and january   respectively 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present certain unaudited quarterly information for the quarterly periods in the years ended january  and january  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
april  july  october  january  april  july  october  january  in thousands  except per share amounts revenue         gross profit         operating expenses         income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax of  net income loss    earnings loss per share before cumulative effect change in accounting principle basic earnings loss per share before cumulative effect change in accounting principle diluted earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share diluted we have experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers  and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced variations in our revenues from quarter to quarter primarily related to the significant growth of our interactive television products in the broadband segment and broadcast segment products 
we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
during the quarterly periods outlined above  we experienced certain fluctuations in our operating expenses 
during the year ended january   we increased headcount within our research and development and sales and marketing areas to reflect our continued investment in future product development and our desire to increase our interactive television and broadcast revenues 
as a result  our expenses in both of these areas increased during the year 
in addition  our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may have a materially adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the forgoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds of our common stock  borrowings and cash flows generated from operations 
cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at january  to million at january  working capital increased from approximately million at january  to approximately million at january  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended january  was approximately million and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january  was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  was the result of the net income adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million and the changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
the significant net changes in assets and liabilities that provided cash from operations included an increase in deferred revenues of approximately million 
these items that generated cash from operations were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  a decrease in customer deposits of million and an increase in inventories of approximately million 
we expect that the broadcast segment and the interactive television products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development  to manufacture and deploy customer test and demonstration equipment and to meet higher revenue levels in both product segments 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the year ended january  and january   respectively 
intangible assets increased by million in as a result of the successful defense of our patents 
investment activity consisted primarily of capital expenditures related to capital equipment required to support the expansion and growth of the business 
we had no material capital expenditure commitments as of january  we had non cancelable purchase commitments for inventories of approximately million at january  net cash provided from financing activities was approximately million and approximately million for the year ended january  and january   respectively 
in the year ended january   the cash provided from financing activities included net proceeds of million from the completion of our public stock offering on january   million in connection with the issuance of common stock issued on february  from a private placement sale of common stock and a warrant to comcast sc investment  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements and an additional million in borrowings under the line of credit with a bank 
during the same period  cash used in financing activities included approximately million in repayments under our revolving line of credit and million in principal payments under our equipment line of credit and capital lease obligations 
in october  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with a bank that expires in october loans made under this revolving line of credit will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s prime rate  at january  as of january   we have borrowings of million under this revolving line of credit 
borrowings under this line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan agreement requires that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization on a trailing twelve month basis 
as of january   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the line of credit replaces our prior revolving line of credit and equipment line with a different bank 
in conjunction with entering into the new bank line  we repaid to our prior lender all outstanding borrowings under the equipment line of credit in an amount of million 
in march  we repaid the outstanding balance under the current line of credit of million plus accrued interest to the bank 
in october  we entered into an agreement with a bank to finance million of the construction costs related to the purchase and renovation of a manufacturing mill in new hampshire that we previously purchased in february during the construction period  interest accrued and was paid at a per annum rate of 
upon occupancy of the building in november  the loan converted into two promissory notes whereby we will pay principal and interest based upon a fixed interest rate per annum over a five and ten year period  respectively  of at january  borrowings under the loan are secured by the land and buildings of the renovated mill 
the loan agreement requires that we provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios 
at january   we were in compliance with all covenants 
as of january   borrowings outstanding under the loan were million 
it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience an increase in our inventories as a result of procurement of both short and long lead components for anticipated orders for both our product segments  a decrease in our accounts payable balance primarily due to the timing of payments for materials purchased for prior month shipments  a decrease in accounts receivable amounts as a result of customer payments without corresponding customer shipments and a resulting decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that existing funds together with available borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the proceeds from this offering are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for us on february  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our current financial position and results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets

sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our current financial position and results of operations

sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires one method of accounting for long lived assets disposed of by sale 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our current financial position and results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf presumes that consideration  including equity instruments  from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products is a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on our current financial position and results of operations as we currently apply its guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at january  and january   we had approximately million and million outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  interest expense on these short term borrowings would increase by approximately  for the twelve month period ended january  and  for the twelve month period ended january the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider investments to be purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures
