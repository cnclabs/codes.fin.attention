item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
introduction during and  we transitioned from an acquisition growth strategy to a strategy focused on internal growth and maximizing operational cash flow to repay debt 
we have substantially completed the integration of previously acquired companies and achieved planned integration cost savings 
we have shifted our primary focus to the efficient management of cash flows from our operations 
in the past  we experienced significant growth 
over the past nine years  we have completed over acquisitions  most significantly  the acquisition of browning ferris industries  inc bfi on july  in connection with the bfi acquisition  each share of bfi common stock was converted into the right to receive in cash 
including assumed and refinanced debt  the original cost of acquiring bfi was approximately billion 
financing for the acquisition was obtained from draws of billion from credit facilities with a capacity of billion the credit facility  the sale of billion of newly issued senior convertible preferred stock the preferred stock and the sale of billion of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
as a result of the bfi acquisition  we initiated an asset divestiture program  whereby we sold  for cash or through simultaneous buy and sell transactions  certain non core assets that did not fit with our vertical integration operating strategy for total net proceeds of approximately billion 
we completed this divestiture program  with the divestiture and restructure of the american ref fuel operations which was completed on april  although we acquired businesses in  they were smaller tuck in acquisitions acquired to improve the operational efficiencies of existing markets and primarily funded with the proceeds from the divestitures of other non integrated operations 
the annualized revenue of the acquired companies was approximately million 
the results of operations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for business combinations are included in our financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  our historical results of operations presented for  which include only a half year of bfi operations  are not directly comparable to our results of operations in years after general revenues 
our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms generally range from one to five years and commonly have renewal options 
our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and landfills that we operate on behalf of municipalities 
the following tables show the percentage of our total reported revenues by service line and geographic regions 
revenues by service line in thousands  except percentages years ended december  collection disposal recycling other intercompany reported revenues for  collection revenues consist of revenues from commercial customers and revenues from residential customers 
transfer revenues are included in disposal 

table of contents revenues by region years ended december  atlantic central great lakes midwest northeast southeast southwest west other total revenues amounts relate primarily to our subsidiaries which provide services throughout the organization 
our business strategy is to develop vertically integrated operations to internalize the waste we collect and thus realize higher margins from our operations 
by disposing of waste at company owned and or operated landfills  we retain the margin generated through disposal operations that would otherwise be earned by third party landfills 
approximately of the waste we collect as measured by disposal volumes was disposed of at landfills we own and or operate for the year compared to at the end of in addition  transfer stations are an integral part of the disposal process 
we locate our transfer stations in areas where our landfills are outside of the population centers in which we collect waste 
such waste is transferred to long haul trailers or rail cars and transported to our landfills 
operating expenses 
cost of operations includes expenses related to labor  repairs and maintenance  equipment and facility rent  utilities and taxes  environmental compliance and remediation  safety and insurance  disposal and costs of independent haulers transporting our waste to the disposal site 
disposal costs include landfill taxes  host community fees  landfill royalty payments  landfill site maintenance  fuel and other equipment operating expenses and increases in the accruals for estimated closure and post closure monitoring expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and overhead for corporate and field general management  accounting and finance  legal  management information systems and clerical and administrative departments in addition to sales  investor and community relations and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization costs associated with the acquisition and development of landfill airspace and intangible assets 
depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements years  vehicles and equipment years  containers and compactors years and furniture and office equipment years 
goodwill amortization includes the amortization of costs paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired prior to july  in purchase business combinations 
beginning january  we will no longer amortize any goodwill in accordance with the adoption of financial accounting standard board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
also in accordance with sfas  we have recorded no amortization for goodwill acquired subsequent to june  
table of contents the following is a discussion of significant accounting policies for areas where we apply judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and related expenses 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting risk inherent for these areas that you should be aware of and for you to consider 
residual accounting risk is defined as the inherent risk that remains after the application of our policies and processes and is generally outside of our control 
accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk landfill asset and related amortization we own a portfolio of active landfills with estimated remaining lives  based on current waste flows  which range from to over years  and an estimated average remaining life of approximately years 
site permit and technical design in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal level 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the studies are typically prepared by third party consultants  and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the initial studies are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to obtain a landfill permit 
technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
these designs are compiled by third party consultants  and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon receipt of the technical design approval  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved may need modifications at some future point in time 
landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are the factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation  and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on an average expected density to be achieved over the operating life of the landfill 
estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  leachate collection system construction  installation of methane gas monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk to review the adequacy of our cost estimates used in the annual update of the above costs  we compare estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  we review changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and we compare our resulting development cost per acre with prior periods 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
landfill amortization in order to match the amortization of the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
at the end of a landfill s operating life  the landfill asset is fully amortized 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value and estimated future development costs as described above of the landfill by the estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the costs are not inflated and discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to depreciation and amortization expense 
amortization rates per ton are influenced by the original cost basis for the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
allied secured significant landfill assets through business acquisition in recent years and valued them at the time of acquisition based upon market value 
also  per ton rates are influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimates of future landfill development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
the cost estimates are prepared by company and third party engineers based on the applicable local  state and federal requirements and site specific technical design requirements 
estimates of future disposal capacity are updated using aerial surveys of each landfill to estimate utilized disposal capacity and remaining disposal capacity 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in the cost estimates are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
rates could change in the future based upon evaluations of new facts and circumstances relating to site permit and design criteria or development cost 
summary during  we expensed approximately million or an average of per ton consumed  related to landfill amortization 
we incurred landfill development costs of million and acquired or 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk otherwise added million to the landfill assets during the above activity results in an increase in the net book value of our landfill assets from billion at december  to billion at december  we have available disposal capacity of approximately billion tons 
estimated total future development costs for our active landfills is approximately billion  excluding capitalized interest 
closure and post closure liabilities and related costs landfill closure design in addition to our portfolio of active landfills  we own or have responsibility for closed landfills no longer accepting waste changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping or monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 
as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
generally  closure requirements include the application of compacted clay  geosynthetic liners and vegetative soil barriers in addition to the construction of drainage channels and methane gas collection systems  among other closure activities 
post closure monitoring after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which usually extends for years 
post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and monitoring the methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  among other post closure activities 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas systems operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
closure and post closure provision in order to match the cost of the closure and post closure requirements with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we accrue the closure and post closure costs on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill  over its operating life 
for each landfill  the per ton rate is calculated as follows the total estimated future costs required to close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit is quantified 
the timing of the estimated future cash outflows is projected based on the anticipated waste flow into the landfill 
the expenditures are inflated based on an average cpi rate and discounted back to today s dollars using an average long term risk free rate of return 
we review actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing increases or decreases in the per ton rates used to accrue closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in future inflation rate projections could impact our actual future costs and our total liability 
changes in risk free capital rates used to discount the liabilities could cause changes in our recorded liabilities and costs 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk historical interest rates for government backed bonds and other low risk investments to estimate the long term risk free rate of return 
for  the average cpi rate was and the long term risk free rate was 
the present value of the total closure and post closure costs for the landfill is divided by the estimated remaining disposal capacity of the landfill to calculate the per ton rate 
the disposal capacity for the closure and post closure rate is determined on the same basis as the landfill amortization rate previously described 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to cost of operations and an increase to the closure and post closure accrual 
the balance sheet accrual is increased by accreting the balance at the long term risk free rate and recorded as a charge to cost of operations 
actual cash expenditures reduce the accrual as they are incurred 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimate of future closure and post closure costs and estimates of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
cost estimates are prepared by internal and third party engineers based on the applicable local  state and federal regulations and the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
revisions in estimates of our costs are treated prospectively for our operating landfills but are recorded immediately for closed landfills 
rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating disposal capacity estimates are updated using aerial surveys of each landfill to estimate remaining disposal capacity 
summary during we expensed approximately million or an average of per ton consumed  related to provisions for closure and post closure accruals  including accretion 
during  expenditures against these accruals were million 
we currently estimate total future payments for closure and post closure to be approximately billion 
the present value of such estimate is billion 
at december  and  accruals for landfill closure and post closure costs were million and million  respectively which reflects the degree to which we have filled the landfill 
estimated remaining disposal capacity as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit obtained 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include deemed permitted disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  which relates to additional disposal capacity being we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for disposal capacity that has been deemed permitted 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for deemed permitted disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk sought through means of an expansion 
deemed permitted disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as deemed permitted are as follows obtain approvals is less both costs and disposal capacity will change  which will impact the rates we charge for landfill amortization and closure and post closure accruals 
we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
all geologic and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met  or a variance from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 
we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operations management approval has been obtained 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the landfill amortization and closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related deemed permitted disposal capacity 
at december   we had billion tons of permitted disposal capacity  and at of our landfills  million tons of deemed permitted disposal capacity 
during  million tons of disposal capacity was deemed permitted  and we received permits for approximately million tons of disposal capacity that was previously classified as deemed permitted 
during  we were not denied any expansions for which the disposal capacity was classified as deemed permitted 
non recurring acquisition accruals and related acquisition related and unusual costs nature of liabilities at the time of an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we evaluate and adjust existing accruals of the acquired company to represent our estimate of the future costs to settle the assumed obligations 
assumed liabilities as well as liabilities resulting directly from the completion of the acquisition are considered in the net assets acquired and resulting goodwill allocation 
there could be changes in circumstances or estimates that cause the actual settlement of these liabilities to be higher or lower than our original estimates 
liabilities resulting from changes in estimates of assumed obligations  including litigation  self insurance reserves and loss contracts  as well as liabilities related additional liabilities may exist related to the acquired operations that have not been identified 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk to restructuring and abandonment activities  are accrued at the time of acquisition through a charge to acquisition related and unusual costs 
additionally  transition costs that are not accruable at the time of acquisition  including transitional personnel costs  route restructurings and costs associated with the consolidation of operations are expensed to acquisition related and unusual costs in the period in which the costs are incurred 
estimate updates we evaluate the adequacy of the non recurring acquisition accruals at least annually by obtaining third party actuarial valuations of assumed self insurance obligations  third party legal counsel updates for assumed litigation and field and corporate management reviews of all acquisition related commitments 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
the adjustment is charged to either acquisition related and unusual costs or goodwill consistent with how the original liability was established and the period of time that has elapsed since the date of the acquisition 
generally  we do not record adjustments to goodwill after one year from the date of the acquisition 
summary at december  we had approximately million of non recurring acquisition accruals remaining on our balance sheet  consisting primarily of loss contract  litigation and compliance  and risk management and insurance liabilities associated with the acquisition of bfi 
during  we charged approximately million to acquisition related and unusual costs 
cash paid against non recurring acquisition accruals  including severance in was million and million in environmental liabilities including cercla or other environmental laws nature of liabilities liabilities arise from contamination existing at landfills or other properties and are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for incremental remediation activities and the related litigation costs 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party environmental engineers and attorneys to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination at each identified site and the most appropriate remedy 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
if these liabilities are assumed in connection with an acquisition  these accruals are recorded to acquisition related and unusual costs 
if the liabilities arise through the normal course of business  the accruals are charged to operating expenses 
actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk estimate updates we periodically consult with outside legal counsel and environmental engineers to review the status of all environmental matters and to assist our environmental and legal management in updating our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of resolution 
as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain  the accrued costs are not discounted 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  represents the most probable outcome of these contingent matters 
cash paid for environmental matters during was million 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are partially self insured for automobile  general liability  workers compensation and fully self insured for employee group health claims 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined by a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the expense is charged to operating costs 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by our past claims experience factor  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  these estimates may increase or decrease 
incident rates  including frequency and amounts  could increase or decrease during a year causing our actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease 
the costs to discharge our obligations  including legal costs and health care costs  could increase or decrease 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we provide services to approximately million customers throughout the united states 
we perform credit evaluations of our significant customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our receivables 
in general  we reserve of receivables outstanding days or more and of those outstanding for days 
we also review outstanding balances that may be less than days old on an account specific basis and reserve the receivable if information becomes available indicating we will not receive payment 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
adverse changes in the financial health of our customers could change the timing or levels of collections 
asset impairment valuation methodology we evaluate our long term assets for impairment based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets 
evaluation criteria we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest of certain assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recognition criteria if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
tax accruals we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences in financial reporting and income tax basis of assets  other than non deductible goodwill  and liabilities 
the differences are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we utilize outside experts and legal counsel to assist in the development or review of significant tax positions used in establishing our liability 
the acquisition of bfi in  which was accounted for as a business purchase combination  resulted in approximately billion of goodwill  billion of which the amortization is non deductible 
as of december   net operating loss  capital loss  foreign tax credit and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million remain unused that will expire if not used by the end of various future years 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that some of these carryforwards may not be used 
the balance sheet classification and amount of the tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters 
as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting  any future changes relating to these amounts will result in balance sheet reclassifications  which may include an adjustment to goodwill 
we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
positions taken in those tax years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposures to tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities

table of contents years ended december  and results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to december  reflect the negative impact of the economic slowdown  our inability to maintain selling prices in the face of continued cost basis inflation and the decline in recycled paper commodity prices and volume 
these factors have combined to result in a decrease in revenue and operating margins when comparing year over year results 
the slowing economy and other competitive conditions have resulted in reductions in average prices per unit in most service lines 
revenues 
revenues in were billion compared to billion in  a decrease of or million 
acquisitions increased revenues by million  but were offset by million of divested revenue  resulting in a net decrease in revenue of million between years 
during we increased revenue by approximately three percent through selective price increases on existing customers 
however  this increase was offset by the negative impact of customer turnover and price concessions during the year 
the net result was an increase in revenue of approximately million 
landfill and collection volume increases during resulted in a year over year increase in revenue of approximately million 
recycling revenues decreased by approximately million for driven by declines in recycled paper volumes and prices 
during  we processed approximately million tons of recycled paper  consisting primarily of cardboard  newspaper and mixed paper as compared to million tons in the average price per ton for these products decreased approximately for as compared to cost of operations 
cost of operations in was billion compared to billion in  a decrease of or million 
the decrease in cost of operations was primarily caused by the decrease in revenues 
the cost of recycling revenues decreased by million as a result of the decline in commodity price and volume 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of operations decreased slightly to in from in the decrease as a percentage of revenues is the result of improvement in our landfill internalization from to from the year ended december  to the same period in offset by increased volumes at lower prices primarily in the second half of selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses in were million compared to million in  an increase of

there will be no goodwill amortization from january  and forward upon the adoption of sfas 
table of contents acquisition related and unusual costs during  we recorded approximately million of acquisition related and unusual costs  including transition costs  primarily related to the billing system conversion associated with the acquisition of bfi 
these non recurring costs are decreasing as transition efforts are substantially complete at december  during  we recorded approximately million of acquisition related and unusual costs primarily associated with the acquisition of bfi 
these costs were comprised of approximately million of transition costs related to transitional employees  duplicative facilities and operations  and the billing system conversion which were expensed as incurred 
additionally  we charged million relating to changes in estimated loss contract provisions  restructuring and abandonment liabilities  litigation liabilities and environmental related matters and reversed approximately million of accruals established in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
non cash loss on asset sale 
as part of our ongoing review of operations and our goal of having a self funding market development program  we sold certain non integrated operations during february in the northeast region for approximately million and reflected a non cash loss of approximately million million  net of income tax benefit in the reported results for the first quarter of the proceeds were used to repay debt  and subsequently redeployed as a part of our self funding market development program to purchase assets in other markets that improve our market density and internalization 
during  we recorded million on non cash loss related to divestitures of certain operations 
interest expense  net 
interest expense net of interest income was million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily a result of reductions in the overall debt balance during of million and a decrease in the effective interest rate from at december  to at december  at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly  and through interest rate swap agreements 
income taxes 
income taxes reflect an effective tax rate of in and in the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the non deductibility of the amortization related to billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of bfi

dividends were not paid in cash  instead  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by accrued  but unpaid dividends 

table of contents years ended december  and revenues 
revenues in were billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisition of companies throughout  the most significant of which was bfi which was acquired on july  accordingly  the results in include twelve months of the operations acquired from bfi compared to five months in revenues attributable to existing operations increased approximately in compared to primarily due to pricing increases 
volume increases during were offset by initiatives to reduce customer accounts which were not generating acceptable returns

goodwill amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in goodwill amortization was due to an increase in goodwill of approximately billion primarily resulting from the acquisition of bfi 
acquisition related and unusual costs 
during  we recorded approximately million of acquisition related and unusual costs primarily associated with the acquisition of bfi 
these costs were comprised primarily of approximately million of transition costs related to transitional employees  duplicative facilities and operations  and the billing system conversion which were expensed as incurred 
additionally we charged million relating to changes in estimated loss contract provisions  restructuring and abandonment liabilities  litigation liabilities and environmental related matters reversed approximately million of accruals established in connection with the acquisition of bfi

during  we recorded million of acquisition related and unusual costs associated with the billion acquisition of bfi in july these costs were comprised of approximately million related to changes in estimates of environmental liabilities as a result of assessments performed by third party and in house engineers and legal counsel  million related to changes in estimates of litigation liabilities for employee related  regulatory and other commercial litigation matters  million for costs related to transitional employees and duplicative facilities and operations  million related to commitment fees for financing which was ultimately not required  million related to future anticipated losses on specifically identified contracts  and million for changes to self insurance accruals based upon third party actuarial reviews 
also during  we recorded approximately million for non cash asset impairments for allied assets held for sale  million for the write off of deferred charges for previously targeted acquisitions no longer pursued  million for non cash asset impairments related to duplicative facilities  and million in restructuring and abandonment costs related to other acquisitions 
in addition  million of accrued acquisition related costs associated with acquisitions were reversed to acquisition related and unusual costs

interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in primarily resulted from twelve months of interest expense on debt incurred and assumed in connection with the acquisition of bfi as compared to five months in income taxes 
income taxes reflect an effective tax rate of in and in the effective income tax rate in deviates from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the billion non deductible portion of amortization of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
extraordinary loss  net

in connection with these repayments  we recognized extraordinary charges for the early extinguishment of the debt of approximately million million  net of income tax benefit related to the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
in july  we repaid our credit facility prior to its maturity date 
in connection with this repayment  we recognized a non cash extraordinary charge for the early extinguishment of the debt of approximately million million net of income tax benefit related to the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
in connection with the acquisition of bfi  we changed our capitalized interest policy to more accurately reflect our long term business strategy 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million  net of related tax  during  to reflect the cumulative effect on prior years of the change in the method of interest capitalization 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million in and million in  which reflects the dividend on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock issued on july  in connection with the financing of the acquisition of bfi 
dividends were not paid in cash  instead  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by accrued  but unpaid dividends 
liquidity and capital resources our operational liquidity needs are met with operating cash flow 
when non operating liquidity needs arise they are met  if not from remaining operating cash flow  with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash provided by operations for the year of million  is after million spent on non recurring acquisition accruals and transition costs 
after a requirement of million in capital expenditures and million in non operating cash outflows related to net proceeds from divestitures  offset by capitalized interest and new debt issuance cost  we reduced debt by million 
we have historically operated and we expect that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
we regularly use excess available cash from operating and non operating activities to pay amounts owed on our revolving line of credit  which is classified as long term debt 
additionally  this deficit is in part caused by the current portion of non recurring acquisition accruals  which is approximately million as of december  non recurring acquisition accruals are primarily related to the bfi acquisition and have decreased from prior periods and are expected to further decrease in future periods

table of contents disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended forward looking statements 
these statements describe the company s future plans  objectives or goals 
these statements include a statements regarding ebitda in of approximately billion  b statements regarding the generation of approximately million of adjusted free cash flow in and the components thereof  and c statements relating to reduction of the company s debt balance to under billion by the end of these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially including  without limitation  continuing weakness in the us economy in may cause a decline in the demand for the company s services particularly in the commercial and industrial sectors  a decline in the price of commodities sold by the company  increased competitive pressure on pricing and generally make it more difficult for the company to predict economic trends  the company may be impeded in the successful integration of acquired businesses and its market development efforts  a change in interest rates or a reduction in the company s cash flow could impair the company s ability to service and reduce its debt obligations  volatility in interest rates may  among other things  affect earnings due to possible mark to market changes on certain interest rate hedges  divestitures by the company may not raise funds exceeding financing needed for acquisitions in  and severe weather conditions could impair the company s operating results 
such important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in this section  in the section titled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such important factors described below that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations 
shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements made herein are only made as of the date of this filing and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
obligations and commitments as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
our debt structure consisted primarily of billion outstanding under the credit facility  billion of the senior notes issued in  billion of the senior subordinated notes  billion of senior notes issued in and billion of debt assumed in connection with the bfi acquisition 
as of december  there was aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility of the credit facility of approximately million to be used for working capital  letters of credit  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility and the indentures relating to the senior subordinated notes and the senior notes issued in contain financial and operating covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
the following table outlines what we regard as our significant contractual obligations and commitments  their payment dates and expirations 
it does not represent the universe of our contractual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business 
payments due by period  in thousands selected significant contractual obligations current thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations included in long term debt operating leases included in operating expenses 
table of contents the credit facility has certain provisions  calculated annually  which accelerate repayments of principal under the term loans if we generate cash flow in excess of certain levels 
this could result in usage of the revolving loan facility to accommodate cash timing differences 
factors primarily causing excess cash flow  as defined  could include increases in operating cash flow  lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements  net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities 
the company experienced several of these factors in and as a result will retire approximately million of term debt in the first quarter of  which otherwise would have likely been paid later in the year 
adequate capacity for this payment exists through operating cash flow and capacity on the revolver 
we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we are required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations and collection contracts 
these financial assurance requirements are satisfied by our providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits to secure our obligations as they relate to landfill closure and post closure costs and performance under certain collection contracts 
at december   we had outstanding approximately billion in financial assurance instruments relating to our landfill operations  represented by million of surety bonds   million of insurance policies  million of trust deposits and million of letters of credit 
during calendar year  we expect no material increase in financial assurance obligations relating to our landfill operations and collection contracts 
the mix of financial assurance instruments may change in the future 
additionally we have approximately million in operational performance bonds with various municipalities and approximately million of financial guarantee bonds for self insurance 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities 
our ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements  to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest  or to refinance our indebtedness  to provide financial assurance and to fund capital amounts required for the expansion of the existing business depends on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that future financings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
further  depending on the timing  amount and structure of any possible future acquisitions and the availability of funds under the credit facility  we may need to raise additional capital 
we may raise such funds through additional bank financings or public or private offerings of our debt and equity securities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such funding  if necessary  on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are not successful in securing such funding  our ability to pursue our business strategy may be impaired and results of operations for future periods may be negatively affected 
significant financing events in during  through the separate issuance of million and million of senior secured notes  we refinanced approximately billion of our credit facility with fixed rate bonds 
in connection with the closing of each issuance of notes  we amended our credit facility to revise certain financial covenants to provide us with greater operating flexibility 
such revisions were necessitated in part by the declining economic conditions experienced throughout  which caused reductions in certain earnings measures defined under the credit facility 
the cost to us was million for debt issuance and an amendment fee paid to lenders of approximately million 

table of contents the amendments increased the amount of the revolving credit facility that could be used to support the issuance of letters of credit from million to billion 
the amendments changed our total debt to ebitda ratio covenant and our interest coverage ratio covenant  both as defined in the credit facility  as follows december  total debt ebitda current x x x x x x prior x x x x x x ebitda total interest current x x x x x x prior x x x x x x at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
at december  our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined by the loan agreement was and our ebitda to total interest ratio was financing plan we currently intend to use our free cash flow to repay debt in  and we intend to do this while continuing to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures and tuck in acquisitions 
we think that without new sources of funding we can repay from internally generated cash flow about million of our debt in we do not believe the current state of the economy will worsen during  but this is possible and if it does  our internally generated cash flows could be less 
depending on the strength and timing of an economic recovery  we think we could repay debt in and in at amounts above the estimated levels 
these amounts could increase if economic recovery occurs sooner than we anticipate 
they could also increase if we sell assets for proceeds that exceed the cost of assets we acquire 
further reductions in debt could occur if we raise equity funds in the capital markets 
significant elements of the credit facility expire in july in late or early we intend to re finance the credit facility 
the total amount of the credit facility was billion at december  at december   we had billion in funded term loans outstanding 
we had no cash draws outstanding on the billion revolving credit facility 
we had million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving line of credit that support financial assurance purposes  leaving million remaining available 
we believe that between december  and the time we refinance the credit facility  we will reduce its size by about billion 
we believe we have several alternatives available to us that will allow this reduction to occur 
the alternatives include cash flow from operating activities  possible asset divestitures in excess of acquisitions and potential capital market transactions 
capital market transactions could involve either new capital for us or refinancing short term maturities for longer term maturities or some combination of both 
our course of action is subject to ongoing analysis and is dependent on a favorable economic environment 
the exact size  combination or timing of these events has not yet been determined  and we cannot assume that we will be able to secure a refinancing on terms we regard as favorable  or at all 
effects of finance plan on our interest rate swap portfolio accounting consistent with our risk management policy  we enter into floating rate to fixed rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt 
our strategy is to use floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure 
we enter into these contracts solely for the purpose of reducing risk  positions are not taken for trading purposes 
our risk management policy requires that we evaluate the credit of our counterparties and that we monitor counterparty exposure 
at december   counterparties for of our interest rate swap portfolio were rated either aa or aa 
the counterparties for the remaining were rated from a to a 

table of contents our interest rate swap portfolio continues to fix a significant portion of our variable rate interest payment obligation  protecting us from cash flow variations arising from changes in short term interest rates 
we believe this is prudent given our capital structure 
at december   we had billion of notional amount of interest rate swap contracts with a weighted average months to maturity 
these contracts expire during  during  during and during our credit facility requires that of our outstanding credit facility remain hedged through july and our corporate policy is that at least of our total debt must be effectively fixed  either directly or through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly  and through interest rate swap agreements 
the average interest rate paid under swap contracts at december  was compared to libor of 
upon adoption of statement of financial account standards  accounting for derivative and hedging activities as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative and hedging activities  on january   and subsequently throughout the first three quarters of  business plan assumptions were analyzed and evaluated in relation to the amount of anticipated floating rate bank debt outstanding 
we analyzed the amount  scheduled repayment dates and terms of the bank debt 
based on this analysis  we maintained a hedge portfolio with expiration dates not exceeding the anticipated repayment dates of the variable rate bank debt 
accordingly  we achieved an effective hedging relationship with our bank debt and our swap portfolio 
for a swap to be accounted for as an effective hedge  at its inception and on an ongoing basis the forecasted transaction must be likely to occur in our case  our swap portfolio may not exceed the amount or term of the bank debt outstanding 
the updated financing plan  which is based on new circumstances not anticipated at the time we entered into the interest rate swap agreements  contemplates the possibility of refinancing or prepaying variable rate debt before the expiration of some interest rate swap contracts  and as a result  in accordance with sfas we are required to re characterize certain interest rate swap contracts from designated hedges to de designated hedges 
this is because it is possible that future interest rate payments on the underlying variable rate debt may cease prior to the expiration of the related hedge contract portfolio 
nonetheless  until the underlying variable rate debt is paid  the de designated contracts will remain in force to protect us from cash flow variability 
for contracts which remain designated as hedges  settlement payments in each period are included as part of our interest expense 
periodic changes in the market value of those contracts will remain in shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the liability will fluctuate with market interest rate changes  but will reduce to zero over the terms of each of our interest rate swap instruments 
for de designated contracts  settlement payments and periodic changes in market values of the contracts will be presented on the face of the income statement as a gain or loss on derivative contracts 
periodic changes in market value for de designated contracts previously were deferred in aoci 
these changes will now be recorded in the income statement as a gain or loss on a derivative contract 
for de designated contracts the total amount of loss in aoci at december  the time of de designation was approximately million million  net of income tax benefit 
the gross amount will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining terms of the de designated contracts 
the following table outlines our debt and interest rate swap contract maturities as of december  in thousands thereafter discount  net total debt bank debt all other total interest rate swap contracts designated de designated total 
table of contents new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which outlines standards for accounting for an obligation associated with the retirement of a long lived tangible asset 
this standard will apply to our accounting for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
we are required to adopt sfas by january  and are currently assessing the impact  if any  that this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
sfas provides a single accounting model for impairment of long lived assets held for use and for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale including discontinued operations 
sfas does not cover impairment of goodwill 
we adopted sfas on january  there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june   and eliminates the pooling of interest method standard 
adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the effective date for sfas was fiscal years beginning after december  sfas  among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires an annual assessment of goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
sfas requires that any goodwill recorded in connection with an acquisition consummated on or after july  not be amortized and that no goodwill be amortized after january  accordingly  we have not amortized any goodwill for assets acquired subsequent to july  and beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded goodwill amortization of million and million  respectively 
we have evaluated the impact of this statement and tested our existing goodwill for realizability and determined that we have no impairment of our goodwill and therefore no impact upon adoption to our consolidated financial statements effective january  however  in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of assets when it was determined that re deployment of the proceeds from the sale of such assets improved operational strategy and was economically beneficial 
if such decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses on asset sales 
this is because  under sfas we evaluate goodwill impairment based on a fair value approach at an overall reporting unit level  which aggregates several business units with similar operational characteristics 
a divestiture of any individual asset below the reporting unit level could result in a loss 
total net unamortized goodwill at december  is approximately billion  of which approximately billion is not deductible for income tax purposes 
following is the calculation of our estimated diluted earnings per share for the years ended december  and without the impact of goodwill amortization in thousands  except per share amounts  unaudited year ended december  income before income taxes before extraordinary loss and including minority interest add goodwill amortization income before goodwill amortization less income tax provision net income less dividends net income available to common shareholders weighted average common and common equivalent shares diluted eps  without goodwill amortization 
table of contents risk factors leverage and ability to service debt 
we have had and will likely continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements 
at december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences 
for example it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry  increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt is not hedged  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry  limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain other credit based financing capacity  and subject us to a greater risk of noncompliance with financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material negative effect on us 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payment on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our credit facility  and certain of the agreements governing our other indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payment to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
we must also comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions which may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
in addition  our credit facility and these other agreements contain additional affirmative and negative covenants  including limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make acquisitions and capital expenditures 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 

table of contents if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under that credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness or prevent us from making debt service payments on any other indebtedness we owe 
if we are unable to repay any borrowings when due  the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against their collateral  which includes most of the assets we own  including the stock and assets of our subsidiaries 
in addition  any default under our credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
competition 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is highly competitive 
we compete with large companies and municipalities which may have greater financial and operations resources 
we also compete with the use of alternatives to landfill disposal because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we can not ensure that our landfills will continue to operate at full capacity 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is led by three large national waste management companies allied  waste management  inc  and republic services  inc 
it also includes numerous regional and local companies 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax exempt financing and may control the disposal of waste collected within their jurisdictions 
we encounter competition due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and incineration 
further  most of the states in which we operate landfills have adopted plans or requirements that require counties to adopt comprehensive plans within the next few years to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling or other programs 
state and local governments are increasingly mandating waste reduction at the source and prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard wastes  at landfills 
these trends may reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  we cannot assure that we will be able to operate our landfills at their full operating capacity or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for services 
we also encounter competition in our acquisition of landfills and collection operations 
this competition is due to our competitors interest in acquiring solid waste assets 
business strategy 
over the long term  our ability to continue to sustain our current vertical integration strategy will depend on our ability to maintain appropriate landfill capacity  collection operations and transfer stations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace such assets either timely or cost effectively or integrate acquisition candidates effectively or profitably 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding the permitted capacity of our current landfills once our landfill capacity is full 
in such event  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to another of our landfills  which could significantly increase our waste disposal expenses 
in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of assets when it was determined that re deployment of the proceeds from the sale of such assets either to pay down debt or to purchase other assets that improve our integrated operation strategy was economically beneficial 
if such decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses on asset sales 
acquisitions may increase our capital requirements because acquisitions require sizable amounts of capital  and competition with other solid waste companies that have a similar acquisition strategy may increase prices 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will successfully obtain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other regulatory measures 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups 
a failure to obtain the required permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations 

table of contents limited operating history with regard to recently acquired businesses 
during  and  we acquired companies  including bfi  with annualized revenues of approximately billion and sold operations with annualized revenues of approximately billion 
thus  we have only a limited history of operating a significant portion of our business 
it is also possible that we will acquire landfills  collection operations and transfer stations in the future 
although we believe we have substantially completed the integration of bfi  future acquisitions may pose integration problems and expected financial benefits and operational efficiencies may not be realized 
our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
ongoing capital requirements 
our ability to remain competitive  sustain growth and expand operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
we intend to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations and to fund our growth 
we spent approximately million for capital expenditures and closure and post closure and remediation expenditures related to our landfill operations during  and we expect to spend approximately million for these purposes in if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  closure and post closure and remediation expenditures will increase 
the increase in expenditures may result in low levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits 
our cash needs will increase if the expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring increase above the current reserves taken for these costs 
expenditures for these costs may increase as a result of any federal  state or local government regulatory action 
these factors  together with those discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and therefore impair our ability to invest in our existing facilities or new facilities 
we are required to provide certain financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill and collection operations 
we are required to provide approximately billion in financial assurance obligations relating to our landfill operations 
additionally we have approximately million in operational performance bonds with various municipalities and approximately million of financial guarantee bonds for self insurance 
these financial assurances include surety bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies and trust deposits required principally to secure our estimated landfill closure and post closure obligations and collection contracts 
the mix of financial assurance instruments may change in the future  which may result in an increased use of letters of credit as financial assurance instruments 
letters of credit provided as financial assurance are issued under the credit facility and as such are a use of borrowing availability 
our ability to pay our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance 
our future performance may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we believe that our current available cash flow and borrowings available under our credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future requirements for working capital  letters of credit  closure  post closure and remediation expenditures  acquisition related expenditures and capital expenditures 
we may need to refinance our senior notes  the credit facility  the senior subordinated notes  the assumed bfi debt  the senior notes  and or other indebtedness to pay the principal amounts due at maturity 
in addition  we may need additional capital to fund future acquisitions and the integration of solid waste businesses 
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to pay our debt obligations and capital expenditures 
in addition  we may be unable to refinance our debt obligation on commercially reasonably terms or at all 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly  and through interest rate swap agreements 
the amount of this swap contract portfolio was billion 
upon the de designation of billion of this portfolio  non cash mark to market gains and losses based on changes in future yield curves will be recorded in the statement of operations 
decreases in the yield curves could result in non cash losses being recorded in the statement of operations 

table of contents economic conditions 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
the weakening in the u 
s 
economy has had a negative effect on our operating results  including decreases in revenues and ebitda 
additionally  as is expected in a down cycle economic environment  we have experienced the negative effects of reductions in the rate of volume growth at our landfills  as well as increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover 
the events of september th further exacerbated difficult conditions in the us economy and our industry generally 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate  that will continue to put pressure on the volume of waste being disposed at our facilities and the pricing that we are able to achieve for our services 
in addition  worsening economic conditions may lead to further negative effects of customer turnover 
there can be no assurance that worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
seasonal weather conditions 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely affected by long periods of inclement weather which interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity and or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  certain of our operations may be temporarily suspended as a result of particularly harsh weather conditions 
severe weather can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal 
long periods of inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
dependence on senior management 
we depend highly upon our senior management team 
we will continue to require operations management personnel with waste industry experience 
we do not know the availability of such experienced management personnel or how much it may cost to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management personnel could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
influence of government regulation and other third party actions 
our equipment  facilities  and operations are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety 
these include  among other things  laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
our compliance with regulatory requirements is costly 
we are often required to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these standards 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or may lose certain permits and licenses 
we are  and also may be in the future  defendants in lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and surrounding landowners who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury  property damage and or violations of permits and licenses by us 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
certain of our waste disposal operations traverse state and county boundaries 
in the future  our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by proposed federal legislation that authorizes the states to enact legislation governing interstate shipments of waste 
such proposed federal legislation may allow individual states to prohibit or limit importing out of state waste to be disposed of and may require states  under certain circumstances  to reduce the amount of waste exported to other states 
if this or similar legislation is enacted in states in which we operate landfills that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out of state  our operations could be negatively affected 
we believe that several states have proposed or have considered adopting legislation that would regulate the interstate transportation and disposal of waste in the states landfills 
our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by flow control legislation which may be proposed in the united states congress 
this proposed federal legislation may allow states and local governments to direct waste generated within their jurisdiction to a specific facility for disposal or processing 
if this or similar legislation is enacted  state or local governments with jurisdiction over our landfills could act to limit or prohibit disposal or processing of waste in our landfills 

table of contents potential environmental liability 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
due to the limited nature of our insurance coverage of environmental liability  if we were to incur substantial financial liability for environmental damage  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
hazardous substances liability 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or cercla  and analogous state laws 
cercla has been interpreted to impose strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners or operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility and on persons who transport such substances to facilities selected by such persons 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
as used in this report  non hazardous waste means substances that are not defined as hazardous waste under federal regulations 
the statute provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes costs on the responsible parties 
the expense of conducting such a cleanup can be significant 
we have significant liabilities under these laws  primarily due to acquired businesses and properties and their former operations 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by acquired companies 
in addition  actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes 
potential undisclosed liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition made by us  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or are unable to discover including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners and for which we  as successor owner  may be responsible 
similarly  we incur capitalized costs associated with acquisitions or other business ventures  which may never be consumated  resulting in a potential charge to earnings 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
we are unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
to moderate the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we have effectively converted a significant portion of our long term debt  which required payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
these transactions required us to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact earnings and cash flow in as a significant portion of variable rate debt had been swapped for fixed rates 
the following interest rate table summarizes all interest rate swaps that were in effect and their fair value as of december  fair market notional principal value in thousands maturity interest paid underlying obligations interest received in thousands may march credit agreement term loan facility libor  at december   of our debt was fixed either directly or through interest rate swap agreements 
accordingly  any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on our net income 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk
