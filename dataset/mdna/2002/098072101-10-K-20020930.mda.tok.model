item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing 
overview of our business bone care is a pharmaceutical company engaged in discovering  developing and commercializing improved vitamin d hormone therapies to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with kidney or renal disease  osteoporosis and other diseases including psoriasis and cancers of the prostate  breast and colon 
we were founded in as a subsidiary of lunar corporation  located in madison  wisconsin  and we were spun off from lunar in we licensed our first product  doxercalciferol or hectorol  as it is known commercially  in from the university of wisconsin  a leading vitamin d research center 
hectorol  also known as doxercalciferol  is a vitamin d replacement therapy approved by the fda in two formulations to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end stage renal disease  or esrd 
hectorol is a safe and effective therapy for reducing elevated levels of parathyroid hormone pth in blood in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism  a disease characterized by excessive secretion of pth 
hyperparathyroidism  if left untreated  can eventually result in cardiovascular compromise  reduced immunity  muscle weakness  bone loss and fractures 
virtually all esrd patients suffer from secondary hyperparathyroidism 
we obtained fda approval for hectorol capsules in june  and we began selling this orally administered product in the united states in october we filed a supplemental new drug application with the fda in december to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease ckd patients 
if approved  this would expand the approved indications for hectorol capsules 
we obtained fda approval for hectorol injection in april  and we began selling this intravenous product in the united states in august we are also developing doxercalciferol and other vitamin d hormones to treat several other diseases 
from our inception in  we have generated minimal revenue from operations  and from our inception substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development  patenting  pre clinical testing  and clinical trials of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  the development of manufacturing processes for hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  pursuing united states regulatory approvals of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  the sales and marketing associated with the launch of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  and research and development and pre clinical testing of other potential product candidates 
we have lost money since inception and  as of june  have an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our only sources of revenue have been revenues from the launch of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  licensing fees associated with our early stage research collaborations  which licenses have since expired  and fees from conducting incidental laboratory assay services 
we estimate that commercialization  regulatory compliance and sales efforts associated with hectorol capsules and hectorol injection will exceed million per year prior to achieving profitable operating levels 
further  development of lr  bci and other product candidates  or expansion of hectorol into other therapeutic areas  will require significant  time consuming and costly research and development  pre clinical testing and extensive clinical trials prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
we plan to continue pre clinical testing of lr and bci in order to begin phase i clinical trials on both product candidates within three years 
the pre clinical efforts could cost approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial losses at least through june  until revenues from the sale of hectorol products are sufficient to offset those expenses 
the amount and timing of our operating expenses will depend on many factors  including the extent to which hectorol capsules and hectorol injection obtain market acceptance  the costs of sales and marketing activities associated with hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  the status of our research and development activities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  protecting and enforcing our patent claims and other proprietary rights  our ability to maintain our current manufacturing capabilities through relationships with third parties or establish those capabilities internally  technological and other changes in the competitive landscape  and evaluation of the commercial viability or potential of product candidates 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful 
results of operations for fiscal years ended june  compared to june  total revenues increased to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  this increase resulted from increased sales of both hectorol injection and hectorol capsules 
hectorol injection  launched in august  generated revenues of  during the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june  hectorol capsule revenues were  for the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  bone care began selling hectorol capsules in october because hectorol capsules were bone care s first product  bone care did not initially have historical data to estimate returns and exchanges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenues from shipments of hectorol capsules and the related costs were deferred at the time of shipment to wholesalers and included in the statement of operations at the time the product was sold by these wholesalers to retail users of the product 
effective october   bone care had sufficient experience to estimate future product returns and began recording sales and the related costs of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection based on shipments to its customers reduced by the estimated future returns 
bone care s june  balance sheet includes a reserve of  representing the estimated amount of future returns related to hectorol capsules and hectorol injection 
gross margins on product revenues excluding a  inventory write off in fiscal and a  inventory write off in fiscal were  or of product revenues  for the year ended june  compared to  or of product revenues  for the year ended june  we wrote off  of excess hectorol capsule inventory in fiscal and  in fiscal representing amounts we estimated would not be sold prior to the expiration date 
during the year ended june   bone care subsequently recovered approximately  of hectorol capsule inventory that was previously written off when the fda agreed to extend the expiration date from four to five years 
the original cost of the recovered hectorol capsule inventory was written off over the years ended june  and as an adjustment to cost of goods sold of  and  respectively 
we also wrote off  of hectorol injection inventory in the year ended june  that did not meet quality control release test standards 
we expect gross margins to decline somewhat in the year ended june   because we have increased our expenditures for quality assurance and compliance 
our research and development expenses were  in the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june  the  increase is attributable to expanded preclinical studies designed to evaluate early stage compounds in the treatment of psoriasis and prostate  breast  and colon cancers  an increase of one preclinical and two clinical positions and related salaries and benefits  and increased facility costs at our new middleton  wisconsin  site 
sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  these increases are attributable to an increase in the sales force from to during the year ended june  we also increased the clinical support staff from to  and the marketing staff from to during the year ended june  we implemented these headcount increases in anticipation of a national j code that became effective january  this code was issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for reimbursement of hectorol injection during hemodialysis 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the increase was the result of our overall growth and related expansion of infrastructure to support bone care s increased commercial activities 
these increases include costs associated with the executive search for the president and ceo position  increased insurance premiums  salaries and general legal fees 
interest income decreased  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the decrease was due to lower average cash and marketable security balances for the year ended june   as well as a decline in yield on our investments 
results of operations for fiscal years ended june  compared to june  total revenues increased to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  this increase is primarily the result of our launch of hectorol injection in august  which generated revenues of  during fiscal hectorol capsule revenues were  for the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  bone care began selling hectorol capsules in october because hectorol capsules were bone care s first product  bone care did not initially have historical data to estimate returns and exchanges in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenues from shipments of hectorol capsules and the related costs were deferred at the time of shipment to wholesalers and included in the statement of operations at the time the product was sold by these wholesalers to retail users of the product 
bone care s june   balance sheet includes deferred income of  effective october   bone care had sufficient experience to estimate future product returns and began recording sales and the related costs of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection based on shipments to its customers reduced by the estimated future returns 
bone care s june   balance sheet includes  representing the estimated amount of future returns related to hectorol capsules and hectorol injection 
gross margins on product revenues excluding a  write off in fiscal and a  write off in fiscal were  or of product revenues  for the fiscal year ended compared to  or of product revenues  for the fiscal year ended june  we wrote off  of excess hectorol capsule inventory in fiscal and  in fiscal representing amounts  which we estimated would not be sold prior to the expiration date 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the fda agreed to lengthen the expiration period from three to four years 
our research and development expenses were  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the  increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount and related salaries and benefits 
sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  of the increase related to the development of a marketing research database which analyzes dialysis patient data associated with d hormone treatments 
the remainder of the increase was a result of additional personnel and related expenses associated with the launch of hectorol injection 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase was the result of our overall growth and related expansion of infrastructure to support bone care s increased commercial activities 
interest income increased  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase was attributable to the receipt of  net cash proceeds from the sales of common stock during december and january critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this filing 
those financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
sales returns and allowances when revenue is recognized  bone care simultaneously records an estimate of various costs  which reduce product sales 
these costs include estimates for product returns  chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
estimates are based on a variety of factors including actual return experience  rebate and chargeback agreements  inventory levels at our wholesale customers  and estimated sales by our wholesale customers to other third parties who have contracts with us  respectively 
actual experience associated with any of these items may differ materially from our estimates 
factors are reviewed that influence our estimates and  if necessary  adjustments are made when we believe that actual product returns  chargebacks  rebates  and discounts may differ from established reserves 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
credit terms are extended on an uncollateralized basis primarily to wholesale drug distributors and independent clinics throughout the united states 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  percentage of accounts receivable by aging category  and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
historically  our actual losses from uncollectible accounts have been insignificant 
excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined at a standard cost rate 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  expiration dates  and the estimated time to sell such inventory 
as appropriate  provisions are made to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
historically  cost of inventories that potentially may not sell prior to expiration or are deemed of no commercial value have been written off when identified 
liquidity and capital resources in december and january we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
in october  we completed a directed public offering of  shares of newly issued common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
net cash used in operating activities was  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the cash used by operating activities was used primarily to fund research and development as well as marketing and commercialization efforts for hectorol capsules and hectorol injection 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and do not anticipate generating sufficient positive cash flows to fund our operations until we achieve  if ever  significant revenues from the sale of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection 
we have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds for our research and development programs  pre clinical and clinical testing  regulatory processes  including completion of fda post approval phase iv commitments for hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  manufacturing expenses  sales and marketing programs  and other operating expenses 
cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were  at june  and  at june  cash and cash equivalents and investments are currently comprised primarily in money market funds  short term investment grade united states government  municipal and corporate debt securities 
bone care s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of commercialization and marketing activities  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes and developments in bone care s existing licensing relationships and the terms of any new collaborative  licensing  co promotion or distribution arrangements that bone care may establish  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical products  and other factors not within our control 
based upon our current plans  we believe that we will have sufficient funds to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next two years 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations  however  we do not have any specific plans to raise additional capital 
if we seek additional funds  equity offerings or other sources would be considered 
there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
at june   we had state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will begin expiring in and  respectively 
we also had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will begin expiring in and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board finalized statement of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
goodwill will no longer be amortized 
instead  an assessment of fair value will be used to test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
bone care adopted sfas no 
effective july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our sales from inception to date have been made to united states customers  and as a result  we have not had any exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
however  in future periods  we expect to sell in foreign markets  including europe and asia 
as our sales are made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
as of june   we held  of short term marketable securities and  of long term marketable securities 
the investments have been made for investment as opposed to trading purposes 
interest rate risk with respect to our investments is not significant as all such investments are in us dollar cash equivalents and are short term investments  which are by their nature less sensitive to interest rate movements  or have maturities in excess of one year and are expected to be held to maturity  thereby eliminating the risks associated with interest rate changes
