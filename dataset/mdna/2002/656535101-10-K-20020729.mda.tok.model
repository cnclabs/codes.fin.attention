 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of norstan s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation of accounts receivable 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by norstan which require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the company considers these to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
revenue recognition 
norstan s principal sources of revenues are derived from the sale  installation and service of its full range of voice and data technologies and services 
within the communications technologies segment  solutions revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term contracts and services revenues from maintenance service contracts  moves  adds  and changes  and network integration services  are recognized as the services are provided 
service contracts are generally pre billed 
table of contents either on a quarterly or annual basis and any prepayments are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and taken into income over the service period on a straight line basis 
resale services revenues generated from the secondary equipment market are recognized upon performance of contractual obligations  which is generally upon installation or shipment 
financial services revenues are recognized over the life of the related lease receivables using the effective interest method 
if norstan does not accurately estimate the resources required and the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under its customer contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations and would be reflected in the period in which they were identified 
deferred taxes 
norstan recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
norstan regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes valuation allowances based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a given period  an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations is recorded 
conversely  when a valuation allowance is reduced  a tax benefit is recorded in the statement of operations 
as of april   the company had recorded valuation allowances of million related to its capital loss carryforward and canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  norstan reversed the valuation allowance related to its us net operating loss carryforward and recorded a tax benefit of million 
the reversal of this allowance was mainly due to the recently enacted us federal five year net operating loss carryback rules resulting in a million federal tax refund which was received in june  fiscal taxable income and the company s estimates of future operating earnings 
the remaining valuation allowance has been provided for the company s capital loss carryforward which expires in fiscal  and the company s canadian net operating loss carryforwards which expire through fiscal as of april   norstan does not believe it is more likely than not that these tax assets will be realized 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods or if uncertainties arise related to the company s ability to utilize some or all of the deferred tax assets  the company may need to establish additional valuation allowances which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
norstan performs credit checks on all new contract customers with orders greater then  credit limits are assessed according to current creditworthiness including but not limited to  the customer s current financial condition  working capital and payment histories 
collection activity for service contract customers is performed on an ongoing basis with payments due quarterly in advance of service commencement 
norstan enforces a service hold policy if a customer is in default of its payment obligation and has provided no immediate commitment to pay 
bad debt reserves are established and continuously evaluated based on customer collections and payments  historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that may have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within norstan s expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that the company will continue to have similar experience 
in addition  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of the company s customers or any adverse change in general economic conditions could have a material impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  norstan reported net income from continuing operations of million as compared to significant net losses incurred during the fiscal years ended april  and the company has 
table of contents taken numerous actions in efforts to improve its cash flows including the disposition of its unprofitable it consulting operations and reducing costs in its continuing businesses as evidenced by the million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal these measures provided sufficient operational improvements and liquidity to allow the company to meet its cash flow needs during fiscal while significantly reducing its long term debt and the related interest expense 
on july  norstan entered into a new million credit facility see capital resources 
based on these positive developments and the company s operating plans for fiscal  management believes that cash flows generated by operations and other capital resources will be sufficient to meet its cash flow needs through at least april  however  there can be no assurance that the assumptions used by management in formulating its assessment will prove accurate 
in the event that the company requires supplemental sources of capital  there can be no assurance as to their availability on terms acceptable to the company 
cash flows 
continuing operations provided net cash from operations of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
net income from continuing operations improved to million in fiscal as compared to losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this improvement together with a reduction in accounts receivable was offset by a reduction in norstan s trade accounts payable and an increase in income taxes receivable 
subsequent to year end  the million federal tax refund related to the us net operating loss carryback was collected 
net cash of million was provided by investing activities in fiscal  an increase of over million from this increase was the result of the winding down of norstan s leasing activity which led to a significant reduction in investment in lease contracts between fiscal and in addition  capital expenditures were tightly controlled during fiscal and down from cash of million was used for investing activities in fiscal the change between fiscal and was due to increased proceeds from lease contracts along with decreased investments in lease contract and capital expenditures 
financing activities utilized net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the high level of cash used for financing activities in fiscal and was due to repayment of bank debt and discounted lease rentals 
in addition  there were no discounted lease borrowings in fiscal and minimal borrowings in fiscal management s fiscal year end goal of reducing long term debt to million was achieved as a result of the cash provided by continuing operations  investing activities and discontinued operations 
as of april   outstanding long term debt was million 
capital expenditures 
norstan used million for capital expenditures during fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures were primarily for capitalized costs incurred in connection with obtaining computer and telecommunications equipment used in providing outsourcing services 
norstan currently expects capital expenditures of million to million in fiscal  principally related to computer equipment  software upgrades and other equipment and fixtures 
investment in lease contracts 
norstan has historically made a significant investment in lease contracts with its customers 
as previously discussed  the company is winding down its leasing activities and providing customers with alternative financing through fidelity leasing 
as a result  there was million invested in lease contracts in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net lease receivables decreased to million at april  from million at april  the company utilizes its lease receivables and corresponding underlying equipment to borrow funds from financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis by discounting the stream of future lease payments 
proceeds from discounting are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as discounted lease rentals 
discounted lease rentals totaled million at april  as compared to million at april  interest rates on these credit agreements at april  ranged from to  while payments are due in varying monthly installments through november payments due to financial institutions are made from monthly collections of lease receivables from customers 
norstan also sold certain leases to a third party on a nonrecourse basis during july and august total proceeds from 
table of contents these sales were million which is reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flow in financing activities 
capital resources 
on july   norstan entered into a new million credit agreement with certain banks consisting of the following components a a million revolving line of credit  with availability based on eligible receivables and inventory  as defined  and b a million term loan with quarterly payments of million beginning october  the revolving line matures on june  and the term note matures on october  the term note is subject to certain prepayment provisions in the event the company receives cash from the collection of the promissory note related to the sale of network services 
the agreement also provides that if the term loan is paid to an amount less than million  the company has an option to increase the revolving commitment amount to million provided accounts receivable and inventory levels support such an increase 
the revolving facility and term loan bear interest at the bank s reference rate plus or eurodollar rate advance plus through january  with provisions for future rate reductions if norstan meets certain financial targets 
annual commitment fees range from 
to 
under this agreement the company is required to maintain minimum levels of ebitda and achieve certain other financial ratios 
norstan s former credit agreement consisted of the following i million term loan a with monthly payments through june   ii million term loan b with monthly payments due to begin on july  maturing on december   and iii up to a million revolving line of credit based on the company s level of receivables and inventory  as defined 
the revolving line of credit and term loan a bore interest at the banks reference rate at april  and at april  plus  while term loan b bore interest at the banks reference rate plus 
borrowings under this agreement were million and million as of april  and  respectively 
the company was required to maintain minimum levels of ebitda and achieve certain other financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with or has obtained the appropriate waivers for such requirements as of april  under the terms of the former credit agreement  the lenders were entitled to  warrants to purchase shares of the company s common stock  which were issued at various prices between and per share 
these warrants were recorded at their estimated fair value at their respective dates of issuance  with the resulting costs being charged to expense approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal 
management of the company believes that a combination of cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowing capacity available under the financing arrangements discussed above  and cash received or expected to be received from collection of promissory notes and other transactions will be adequate to meet the anticipated liquidity and capital resource requirements of its business through at least april  however  there can be no assurance that the assumptions used by management in formulating its assessment will prove accurate 
in the event that the company requires supplemental sources of capital  there can be no assurance as to their availability on terms acceptable to the company 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments norstan has various contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments including debt agreements  lease obligations and discounted lease rental commitments 
the following table summarizes future obligations under these contracts due by period as of april  in thousands years ending april  and to thereafter total bank debt operating leases capital leases discounted lease rentals total contractual obligations norstan does not currently have any other material definitive commitments that require cash resources 
however  management continually evaluates opportunities to expand its operations 
this may include the expansion of strategic partner relationships  product service offerings and or our geographic footprint and may include acquisitions 
forward looking statements from time to time  norstan may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products and services  and other similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements including those made in this document 
in order to comply with the terms of the private securities litigation reform act  norstan notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  developments and results of the norstan s business include the following national and regional economic conditions  pending and future legislation affecting the telecommunications industries  norstan s business in canada  stability of foreign governments  market acceptance of the company s products and services  norstan s continued ability to provide integrated communication solutions for customers in a dynamic industry  and other competitive factors 
because these and other factors could affect norstan s operating results  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future period results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of the company s operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  norstan is exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
these risks primarily relate to the sale of products and services to foreign customers and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations  discounted lease rentals  capital leases and other long term debt obligations 
interest rate risk for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not results of operations or cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market 
table of contents value of fixed rate debt will not have an effect on results of operations or cash flows until the company decides  or is required  to refinance such debt 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but does affect future results of operations and cash flows 
norstan has variable rate debt of million outstanding at april  with a weighted average interest rate of 
assuming that the company s balance of variable rate debt remains constant at million  each one percent increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in pre tax interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in cash flows of  conversely  each one percent decrease in interest rates would result in an annual decrease in pre tax interest expense  and a corresponding increase in cash flows of the company periodically finances customer equipment purchases with fixed rate  sales type leases 
the resulting stream of future lease payments is  in turn  used to borrow funds from financial institutions at fixed rates on a nonrecourse basis 
norstan is not exposed to interest rate risk in connection with these arrangements because i both the leases and the debt are at fixed interest rates  and ii norstan typically enters into lending arrangements shortly after execution of the related leases 
the table appearing below presents principal amounts by year of anticipated maturity for norstan s debt obligations and related average interest rates based on the weighted average interest rates at the end of the period 
variable interest rates disclosed do not attempt to project future interest rates 
this information should be read in conjunction with notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ending april  total fair value revolving credit facility variable currently term loan variable currently capital lease obligations fixed currently discounted lease rentals fixed currently total debt obligations foreign currency risk norstan is exposed to foreign currency rate risk 
substantially all foreign exchange exposure is attributable to the canadian dollar 
in general  with a net asset exposure  a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has a negative translation effect 
conversely  with a net asset exposure  a strengthening of the canadian dollar would have the opposite effect 
the average exchange rates for the canadian dollar against the us dollar during the year ended april  remained relatively unchanged 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are located primarily in canada 
norstan s investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are not hedged 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the canadian dollar exchange rate would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
any gain or loss in fair value  associated with the canadian dollar  in the consolidated balance sheets of the company would be recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity 

table of contents during the years ended april   and  the average exchange rates for the canadian dollar strengthened weakened against the us dollar as follows years ended april  increase decrease derivative financial instruments norstan currently does not have any derivative financial instruments in place to manage interest costs  but may consider utilizing such instruments in the future as a means to manage interest rate risk
