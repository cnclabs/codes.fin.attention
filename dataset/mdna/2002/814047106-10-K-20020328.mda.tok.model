as of december   the securities portfolio amounted to million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of assets at december  over recent years  the shrinkage in the size of the securities portfolio relative to total assets indicates that a higher proportion of earning assets have been deployed into the loan portfolio rather than in investment securities to produce greater yields

the major component was million in various advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb under two separate programs 
fhlb balances at december  represent the highest aggregate indebtedness to fhlb for the year 
the first program entails blanket agreements for advances and security agreements with the fhlb  under which snb s banks have pledged residential first mortgage loans and investment securities as collateral to secure available lines of credit totaling million  of which was outstanding as of december  these advances have maturities in varying amounts through march and interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
the second program allows for up to million in advances to snb s banks under a warehouse line secured by the company s loans held for sale 
at december   million in borrowings under the warehouse line was outstanding at an interest rate of percent 
total outstanding advances from the fhlb averaged million during the year  with an average interest cost of percent 
for the year  fhlb advances averaged million with an average interest cost of percent 
fhlb borrowings have been used more extensively during to supplement traditional deposit sources and provide an additional funding source for higher activity levels in mortgage lending 
snb carried a million outstanding note balance at december  under a line of credit with the bankers bank in atlanta  georgia 
this million line is secured with the common stock of sb bibb as collateral  and carries a floating interest rate of prime minus basis points 
the average balance of debt under this line of credit was million for the year at an average rate of percent 
proceeds from line advances were used principally to infuse additional capital to the sb bibb bank to maintain adequate capital levels during peak growth periods 
an additional million was available against this credit line at december  as of december   the sb bibb bank had million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these instruments mature daily and are sold to larger commercial customers of the bank 
mortgage backed securities sold under these agreements are identified  held and segregated by the investment safekeeping agent

a small capital lease obligation amounted to  at year end other interest bearing sources of funds at december  totaled million  up from million at december  of the year end balance  million consisted of fhlb notes under the blanket agreement  million was borrowed under the fhlb s warehouse line  million was in federal funds purchased  million was in securities sold under agreements to repurchase  million consisted of notes payable to the bankers bank  million was in treasury  tax and loan note balances  and million was in capital lease obligations 
reliance on other borrowed money as a nondeposit funding source increased on average from million during to million during the principal increase occurred in the use of fhlb notes to match against the company s growing loan volumes and the fairfield mortgage production 
the cost of all nondeposit borrowed money components averaged percent in  down from percent in other liabilities other liabilities of million at december  and million at december  consist of interest payable on deposits and borrowed funds  federal income taxes payable and other accrued but unpaid expenses 
liquidity snb  primarily through the actions of its subsidiary banks  engages in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals  credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds 
needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income  and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits  the renewal of maturing deposits  and external borrowings 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits as needed 
to the extent needed to fund loan demand  traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits  and other sources outside the company s immediate market area 
high volumes and activity in mortgage and construction lending at the fairfield subsidiary since its acquisition in have required higher levels of sophistication and tracking to ensure adequate liquidity th roughout the company 
the falling interest rate environment during accelerated both new and refinancing mortgage activity  placing added pressure on prudent liquidity management 
more liquidity measurement tools have been developed for use on a consolidated basis 
internal policies have been updated to monitor the use of various core and noncore funding sources  and to balance ready access with risk and cost 
through various asset liability management strategies  a balance is maintained among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines are monitored and enforced by the banks 
part ii continued item continued the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash without loss if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   snb held million in bonds excluding fhlb stock  at amortized or accreted cost  in the available for sale portfolio 
at december   the available for sale bond amounted to million 
only marketable investment grade bonds are purchased 
although most of the banks bond portfolios are encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes  management can restructure and free up investment securities for a sale if required to meet liquidity needs 
management continually monitors the relationship of loans to deposits as it relates to snb s liquidity posture 
snb had ratios of loans and loans for sale to deposits of percent as of december  and percent at december  the purchase of the fairfield mortgage company has increased management s emphasis on maintaining adequate resources for liquidity 
management employs alternative funding sources when deposit balances will not meet loan demands 
the ratio of loans and loans for sale to all funding sources at december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as the company s primary funding source 
the stability of the banks core deposit base is an important factor in the snb s liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
at december  and  the banks had million and million in certificates of deposit of  or more 
these larger deposits represented percent and percent of respective total deposits 
management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates  which tend to be more volatile in nature  to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed 
relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize the company s overall cost of funds 
to compensate for liquidity pressures not satisfied by current deposit balances  the company and its subsidiaries have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management 
the parent company has an unsecured line of credit  and borrowing capacity also exists through the membership of the banks in the federal home loan bank program 
at december   the company had a total of million available on these lines above the currently outstanding borrowings 
additionally  the banks have established borrowing lines for federal funds through correspondent banks  and have access to third party deposit brokers and national cd markets for deposit gathering if needed 
management believes that the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
interest rates have stabilized at a low level after eleven consecutive prime rate cuts during  from percent at january  to percent at december  mortgage refinancing and other loan activity is expected to slow somewhat during  which should lessen future liquidity needs 
part ii continued item continued capital resources and dividends snb has always placed emphasis on maintaining an adequate capital base to support the company s activities in a safe manner  and continues to exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements as shown in table below 
snb s equity capital of million at december  amounts to percent of total assets  compared to percent at december   and percent at december  on average  the equity capital was percent of assets during  compared to percent for and percent for the downward trend in the capital ratios reflect the company s strong balance sheet growth pattern  which has been most pronounced during the past two years 
during the years and  snb s parent holding company has incurred external debt at a correspondent bank to obtain capital infusions for the sb bibb bank 
a total of million has been infused downward to the lead bank to help support exceptional growth trends caused by the fairfield acquisition and favorable local economic conditions 
capital levels at the sb houston bank have been self supporting through earnings retention 
in july   new shares of snb stock were issued in connection with the purchase acquisition of fairfield financial services  inc  producing million in additional capital 
in august   new shares of the company s common stock were issued for the pooling of interests stock swap merger with crossroads bancshares  inc additionally  marked the expiration of the outstanding stock warrants held by the company s organizing directors and executive officers 
during and  the holders completed the exercise of  warrants  generating a total of million in new capital 
there are no remaining founders warrants outstanding 
capital levels in and reflect an influx of million in proceeds from the issuance of new stock in two different events 
in september  snb issued a stock offering for the sale of  new shares of the company s common stock 
the issue  which generated million in new capital  was fully subscribed and successfully completed by february at the beginning of  snb issued an additional  shares of its common stock  primarily to newly elected directors and executive officers of the company 
this action produced million in new capital 
principal uses of the company s capital base in recent years have been a sustaining the capital adequacy of the banks as they continue to grow at a steady pace  b expanding the company s presence in macon and middle georgia with more physical locations and improved delivery systems  c expanding into contiguous houston county through the merger with sb houston and development of a mortgage loan division  d acquiring fairfield to broaden the company s mortgage services markets  and e enhancing corporate infrastructure support systems to manage snb s multi bank environment 
additional acquisitions may occur in the future 
part ii continued item continued regulators use a risk adjusted calculation to aid them in their determination of capital adequacy by weighting assets based on the degree of risk associated with on and off balance sheet assets 
the majority of these risk weighted assets for the company are on balance sheet assets in the form of loans 
small portions of risk weighted assets are considered off balance sheet assets comprised of letters of credit and loan commitments 
capital is categorized as either core tier capital or supplementary tier capital 
tier capital consists primarily of stockholders equity minus any intangible assets  while tier capital can consist of the reserve for loan losses up to certain limits  certain short term and other preferred stock and certain debt instruments 
current regulatory standards require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of percent  with at least percent of the capital consisting of tier capital  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent 
additionally  the regulatory agencies define a well capitalized bank as one that has a tier leverage ratio of at least percent  a tier capital ratio of at least percent  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent 
as of december   snb had a tier leverage ratio of percent  a tier capital ratio of percent  and a total risk based capital ratio of percent 
the company s total risk based capital ratio has fallen below the percent well capitalized status at year end percent and percent 
due to continuing strong growth trends in the balance sheet  management is currently assessing strategies to produce more tier and o r tier capital in the near future to assure adequate capital going forward 
the following table demonstrates capital ratio calculations as of december  and table capital ratios in thousands december as of end of period tier capital stockholders equity less intangible assets total tier capital tier capital eligible portion of reserve for loan losses subordinated and other qualifying debt total tier capital total risk based capital total net risk weighted assets part ii continued item continued table continued capital ratios in thousands regulatory requirement well december minimum capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier capital ratio tier capital to average assets cash dividends of  or

since the commencement of cash dividend payments in  the company s board of directors has consistently declared and paid dividends on a quarterly basis 
on june   a percent stock split was issued and affected in the form of a dividend  and on september   a percent stock split was issued and affected in the form of a dividend 
per share data for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the additional shares resulting from these stock splits 
management is not aware of any trends  events  or uncertainties that will have  or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on snb s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
further  management is aware of no current recommendations by regulatory authorities that  if they were to be implemented  would have such an effect 
acquisitions on july   sb bibb acquired fairfield financial services  inc fairfield  a well established mortgage loan company based in macon  georgia 
the purchase transaction involved a combination of snb stock and cash consideration 
fairfield has a number of production locations throughout georgia and the southeast  including offices in macon  columbus  warner robins  richmond hill  stockbridge  fayetteville and st 
simons island 
the company now functions as a subsidiary of sb bibb 
on january   snb entered into an agreement and plan of merger with crossroads bancshares  inc in perry  georgia  pursuant to which crossroads would be merged with and become a wholly owned subsidiary of snb 
on august   the merger was completed in a stock pooling of interests transaction  and  shares of snb common stock were issued to effect the merger 
on june   the bank name was changed from crossroads bank to security bank of houston county 
sb houston operates four offices in houston county one in perry  georgia and three in warner robins  part ii continued item continued georgia 
the merger allowed snb to establish an immediate presence in its primary targeted market for expansion 
houston county is included in the same macon warner robins metropolitan statistical area as snb s principal bibb county market 
the warner robins air force base is the largest employer in the middle georgia area and helps to make the two counties a common market 
the company s overall growth during the past two years is largely attributed to a the success of these two acquisitions in developing synergies and market cohesiveness in middle georgia  and b the community banking philosophies of the two subsidiary banks during a period of industry consolidation and merger shake ups in the local markets 
expanded coverage of market area bibb county as the company grows  it continues to add physical office locations and delivery channels to serve its existing middle georgia market

these offices  located in macon  columbus  warner robins  richmond hill  stockbridge  fayetteville  st 
simons island  and other areas throughout the southeast  are well established and provide various mortgage  construction and commercial lending services 
snb management may consider converting one or more of the fairfield offices into full service banking offices in the future 
alternatively  management may consider additional expansion moves into the markets where fairfield offices are now located

additional overhead costs have been incurred for the periods shown for the establishment of a more extensive branch network and increased technology costs associated with relocating a multi bank data processing center 
net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and liabilities is the principal source of earnings for the company 
snb s average net interest rate margin  on a taxable equivalent basis  was percent in  percent in  and percent in the trend of decline reflects the falling interest rate environment  competitive pricing for loans and deposits in snb s local markets  and changes in the mix of the loan and deposit portfolios

part ii continued item continued compared to tax equivalent net interest income increased by  from to  spurred mainly by strong growth trends in the loan portfolio 
the average net interest margin declined by basis points  from percent in to percent in the prime loan rate posted an unprecedented basis point drop in eleven decreases over the course of  from percent at the beginning of the year to percent by year end 
average yields on snb s loan portfolio declined by a more modest basis points  from percent in to percent in however  average loan balances for increased by million  or percent over the primary growth came in real estate construction loans  commercial loans  and balances in mortgage loans held for sale 
the acquisition of the fairfield mortgage subsidiary in july added a strong lending team in production offices in lucrative loan markets throughout the state of georgia 
lending activity at the two subsid iary banks continued to be strong as well 
a favorable declining interest rate environment encouraged new construction projects and heavy volumes of refinancing activity to further enhance production in these trends have started to slow in pace as interest rates appear to be approaching their lows for the current cycle 
mortgage lending is very cyclical in nature and reliant on mortgage interest rates 
if rates start to rise in  management anticipates some curtailment of the rate of loan growth in yields on the investment portfolio decreased basis points from percent to percent  and the average balances invested in bonds remained relatively flat from to  increasing only million  or percent 
the overall yield on earning assets on a tax equivalent basis for was percent  a decrease of basis points from percent in on the liability funding side of the balance sheet  the overall cost of interest bearing funds averaged percent in  down basis points from percent in deposits continue to be our primary funding source 
average interest rates on all interest bearing deposits for were percent  a basis point drop from percent for deposit balances increased on average by million  or percent from to a portion of this increase came from noncore brokered certificates of deposit of  or more  but local core deposit growth was strong as well 
a faltering stock market  combined with terrorist attacks in september  encouraged many consumer and business depositors to seek the safety of the banking system 
balances continued to grow in spite of the declining rate environment 
reliance on alternate noncore funding sources became more prevalent in as management sought ways to meet liquidity demands for lending activities 
average balances in various borrowed funds rose from million in to million in rates on external borrowings became more attractive  averaging percent in versus percent in the funding mix in averaged percent from deposits and percent from borrowed money 
this mix changed in to be percent from deposits and percent from external borrowings 
part ii continued item continued compared to tax equivalent net interest income increased by  from to this increase in absolute dollars of margin in was driven by strong balance sheet growth 
the average margin yield declined by basis points  from percent in to percent in over the course of  the prime lending rate increased by basis points  from percent to percent by year end 
management was able to improve loan yields by basis points in spite of intense local competition on loan pricing 
yields on the investment portfolio were also improved by basis points through repricing and purchases at current market rates 
however  the margin was negatively impacted by an increase in the overall cost of funds of basis points for the year 
management resorted to higher balances in more costly borrowed funds to support strong loan growth  and deposits repriced rapidly at higher market rates during the year 
balances in average interest earning assets rose by percent in over growth in higher yielding loan balances accounted for most of the increase 
average loan balances increased percent and represented percent of the average balance sheet in  up from percent of the average balance sheet in investment securities  on the other hand  declined from percent to percent of the average balance sheet 
the overall yield on average interest earning assets  on a taxable equivalent basis  increased by basis points from percent in to percent in at the same time  the overall average cost of interest bearing liabilities has increased by basis points  from percent in to percent in most deposit rates increased in over  due to increases in general market rates and strong competition for deposits 
average deposit balances also grew  increasing percent in over this growth is attributed to aggressive marketing in a period of flux for area super regional competition  growing consumer business due to the convenience of a larger branch network  increases in business deposit relationships from larger commercial credit lines  and fairfield cross selling synergies 
with the increased liquidity needs brought on by strong loan demand and the increased mortgage activity  average balances from other borrowing sources increased by million in to million in rates paid on these borrowings increased as well  from percent in to percent in part ii continued item continued the table on this and the following page summarizes average balance sheets  interest and yield information on a taxable equivalent basis for the years ended december    and table average balance sheets  interest and yields tax equivalent basis  in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate assets loans  net of unearned income a b taxable tax exempt c loans held for sale net loans investment securities d taxable tax exempt c total investment securities interest earning deposits federal funds sold total interest earning assets nonearning assets total assets part ii continued item continued table continued year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  liabilities and stockholders equity average yield average yield average balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest bearing demand deposits money market accounts savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits total interest bearing deposits federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements sold demand note us treasury other borrowed money and fhlb capital leases and mortgage debt total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing demand deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest rate spread net interest income net interest margin notes to table of average balance sheets  interest and yields a interest income includes loan fees as follows in thousands b average loans are shown net of unearned income

part ii continued item continued interest rate risk management the management of interest rate risk is the primary goal of snb s asset liability management function 
snb attempts to achieve consistent growth in net interest income while limiting volatility from changes in interest rates 
management seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities 
snb s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect on net interest income of interest rate moves in either direction is not expected to be significant over time 
the year saw one of the most unique interest rate environments in history 
during this period of recessionary pressures and rapidly falling interest rates  management had to adapt its strategies for growth  pricing and funding to minimize the negative impact on the net interest margin 
as loan balances repriced to the new rates  funding sources deposits and borrowings had to be structured to reprice in like fashion 
core deposit balances had to be supplemented with other noncore borrowing sources 
the company experienced net interest margin compression  as did many community banking companies across the nation 
one tool used by snb to measure its interest rate sensitivity is a cumulative gap analysis model that seeks to measure the repricing differentials  or gap  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time horizons 
additionally  simulation modeling is used to estimate the impact on net interest income of overall repricing at various levels of increase or decrease in current market interest rates over a range of plus or minus basis points over a month shift horizon 
at december   the company estimates through simulation modeling that net interest income would increase by  if interest rates increased by basis points 
this improvement would have amounted to percent of the company s net interest income in in the case of a basis point decline in interest rates  net interest income would increase by  which would have produced a percent improvement in net interest income 
the following table reflects the gap positions of snb s consolidated balance sheet as of december  and at various repricing intervals 
this gap analysis indicates that snb s repricing abilities showed liability sensitivity over a one year time horizon at december  and december   with negative cumulative one year gaps of percent at year end and percent at year end 
the company s cumulative rate sensitive assets as a percentage of cumulative rate sensitive liabilities over a one year time horizon were percent at december   and percent at december  the projected deposit repricing volumes reflect adjustments based on management s assumptions of the expected rate sensitivity to current market rates for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts 
adjustments are also made for callable investment securities in the bond portfolio to place these bonds in call date categories 
management believes that these adjustments allow for a more accurate profile of snb s interest rate risk position 
management is of the opinion that the current degree of interest rate risk is acceptable in the current interest rate environment

part ii continued item continued provision for loan losses the general nature of lending results in periodic charge offs  in spite of snb s continuous loan review process  credit standards  and internal controls 
during  the company also factored in assessments of the economic downturn s effect on the cash flow of some of its borrowers 
amounts of net loans charged off during and  although higher than the company s recent history  are reasonable by industry standards 
snb incurred net charge offs of  during  compared to  during and  in snb expensed  in   in  and  in for loan loss provisions 
the reserve for loan losses on december  stood at of outstanding net loans and loans held for sale  compared to and at december  and the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be transferred to the reserve for loan losses to maintain a level that it considers adequate in relation to the risk of future losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
it is the policy of snb s subsidiary banks to provide for exposure to losses principally through an ongoing loan review process 
this review process is undertaken to ascertain any probable losses that must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of individually significant loans and of the portfolio in the aggregate 
this review takes into consideration the judgments of the responsible lending officers and the loan committees of the banks boards of directors  and also those of the regulatory agencies that review the loans as part of their regular examination process 
during routine examinations of banks  the primary banking regulators may  from time to time  require additions to banks provisions for loan losses and re serves for loan losses if the regulators credit evaluations differ from those of management 
in addition to ongoing internal loan reviews and risk assessment  management uses other factors to judge the adequacy of the reserve including current economic conditions  loan loss experience  regulatory guidelines and current levels of nonperforming loans 
management believes that the  balance in the reserve for loan losses at december   and the  balance in the reserve for loan losses at december  were adequate to absorb known risks in the loan portfolio at those dates 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the company s loan portfolio 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  management  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers ability to repay their obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan becomes impaired  management calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded  through a charge to earnings  as an adjustment to the reserve for loan losses 
when management considers a loan  or a portion thereof  as uncollectible  it is charged against the reserve for loan losses 
the following tables summarize loans charged off  recoveries of loans previously charged off and additions to the reserve that have been charged to operating expense for the periods indicated 
the company has no lease financing or foreign loans

the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur

asset quality nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans restructured due to debtors financial difficulties  loans past due days or more as to interest or principal and still accruing  and real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossession 
nonaccrual loans are those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
restructured loans generally allow for an extension of the original repayment period or a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
loans  whether secured or unsecured  are generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal and or interest is days or more past due  or sooner if it is known or expected that the collection of all principal and or interest is unlikely 
any loan past due days or more  if not classified as nonaccrual based on a determination of collectibility  is classified as a past due loan 
other real estate is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated market value at the date of acquisition 
a provision for estimated losses is recorded when a subsequent decline in value occurs

inflation inflation impacts the financial condition and operating results of snb 
however  because most of the assets of the bank subsidiaries are monetary in nature  the effect is less significant compared to other commercial or industrial companies with heavy investments in inventories and fixed assets 
inflation influences the growth of total banking assets  which in turn produces a need for an increased equity capital base to support the growing banks 
inflation also influences interest rates and tends to raise the general level of salaries  operating costs and purchased services 
the company s mortgage division is particularly impacted by swings in the interest rate cycle 
snb has not attempted to measure the effect of inflation on various types of income and expense due to difficulties in quantifying the impact 
management s awareness of inflationary effects has led to various operational strategies to cope with its impact 
the banks engage in various asset liability management strategies to control interest rate sensitivity and minimize exposure to interest rate risk
