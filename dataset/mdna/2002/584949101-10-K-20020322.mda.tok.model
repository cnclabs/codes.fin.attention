in april  we made a million investment in a life medical  inc  a leader in advanced natural language processing technology for the medical industry 
in september  we advanced a life medical  inc million as a prepayment on a license agreement 
in december  we advanced  to a life medical  inc in connection with an additional investment which closed in january our investment in a life medical  inc is inherently risky due to the nature of its early stage development technology and related uncertain near term opportunities 
we will continue to monitor this investment on a periodic basis 
in the event the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value of the investment and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge will be recorded 
fair value for a life medical  inc is based on estimates and assumptions used in forecasted financial models 
in order to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than carrying value  the financial condition of the company  including key operational and cash flow metrics  current market conditions  future trends and the business outlook for the company  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we have previously accounted for the investment in a life under the cost method 
as a result of our increased ownership percentage from the january financing transaction  we will begin to account for the investment under the equity method 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent  on hand  and cash flow generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no

the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we are required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
for goodwill is expected to result in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million in at december   we had goodwill of approximately million and during the twelve months ended december  we incurred approximately million in amortization associated with goodwill 
subsequent to june   we completed two purchase business combinations resulting in goodwill of million 
pursuant to sfas no
