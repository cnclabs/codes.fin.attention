item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our principal product is our clave needleless iv connection system 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by product as a percentage of total net sales product line clave custom and generic iv systems clc lopez valve rf rf rhino protected needle and other products total we sell our products to independent distributors and through agreements with abbott  b 
braun  the abbott agreements and the b 
braun agreements  respectively and certain other medical product manufacturers 
most independent distributors handle the full line of our products 
abbott and b 
braun both purchase clave products  principally bulk  non sterile connectors 
abbott also purchases the rhino  a low priced connector specifically designed for abbott  and the clc  and under an agreement signed february   custom iv sets 
b 
braun also purchases the mcgaw protected needle and pays us revenue sharing payments on its sales of its safeline products 
we also sell certain other products to a number of other medical product manufacturers 
the abbott agreements extend to december the b 
braun agreement for clave extends to december all have extension provisions beyond those dates 
we believe that as the healthcare provider market continues to consolidate  our success in marketing and distributing clave products will depend  in part  on our ability  either independently or through strategic supply and distribution arrangements  to secure long term clave contracts with major buying organizations 
further  our marketing and distribution strategy may result in a significant share of our revenues being concentrated among a small number of distributors and manufacturers 
the loss of a strategic supply and distribution agreement with a customer or the loss of a large contract by such a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we believe the success of the clave has  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece needleless connectors which may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
we are aware of a number of such products 
in response to competitive pressure  we have been reducing prices to protect and expand our market 
the price reductions to date have been more than offset by increased volume 
we expect that the average price of our clave products will continue to decline 
there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
the federal needlestick safety and prevention act  enacted in november  modified standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration to require employers to use needleless systems where appropriate to reduce risk of injury to employees from needlesticks 
we believe the effect of this law will be to accelerate sales of our needleless systems  although we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of such sales 
we are taking steps to reduce our dependence on our current proprietary products 
we are seeking to substantially expand our custom iv systems business with products sold to medical product manufacturers and independent distributors and expand selectively into the production of generic iv sets 
on february   we signed an agreement with abbott under which we will manufacture all new custom iv sets for sale by abbott  and we will jointly promote the products under the name setsource 
we expect a significant increase in sales of custom iv systems under this agreement 
we also launched setfinder  a separate subsidiary  which will contract with and distribute commodity type standard iv sets directly to healthcare providers and to group purchasing organizations and independent dealer networks when not in common with our iv sets handled by our other distributors 
there is no assurance that either one of these initiatives will succeed  or that the expected increases in sales under the february contract with abbott will occur 
we have an ongoing program to increase systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiency  reduce labor costs  reduce time needed to produce an order  and minimize investment in inventory 
the original focus was on production of custom iv systems  which is relatively labor intensive  it now includes all automated manufacturing operations as well 
manual assembly is now performed at the facility opened in december in ensenada  baja california  mexico 
in  the company made significant investment in automated molding and assembly equipment 
both of these steps have reduced unit production costs 
ongoing steps also include automation of the production of new products  such as the clc and the o valve  and other products for which volume is growing 
because significant innovation is required to achieve these goals  there is no assurance that these steps will achieve the desired results 
we distribute products through four distribution channels 
net sales for each distribution channel were as follows channel medical product manufacturers independent domestic distributors international setfinder total comparison of to in  we had net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of clave products  including custom clave iv systems 
net sales to abbott were  in  compared to  in clave sales increased to  from  because of an increase in unit volume somewhat offset by lower average selling prices 
sales under the setsource program approximated  for the year  they have been increasing monthly and exceeded  for the month of december we expect a substantial increase in clave unit and dollar sales volume with abbott in  as well as a significant increase in setsource unit and dollar sales volume 
net sales of the clc and rhino declined as abbott balanced its inventory position 
we expect sales of the clc to abbott will increase in the future 
sales of the rhino are expected to continue the decline which started in early as the market shifts to swabable technology 
sales of custom clave iv sets declined as production of several high volume sets was transferred to abbott 
there is no assurance as to the amount of any of the future sales increases to abbott 
net sales to b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in the decrease was principally because of a decrease in clave sales 
unit sales of clave products to b 
braun increased  but a decrease in average selling prices  in part because of a decrease in prices and in part because of a change in the product mix to lower priced products  more than offset the effect of higher unit volume 
we expect a decrease in clave and dollar sales to b 
braun in  particularly in the first half of the year  at least in part because we believe that their purchase of clave products in the latter half of exceeded their sales to their customers 
sales of the mcgaw protected needle increased from last year  but we expect sales to decline in the future  as they have in most recent periods  as the market for safe connectors continues to shift to needleless swabable technology 
safeline revenue sharing payments decreased from last year  such payments depend on the volume and selling prices of b 
braun s safeline products  and although we cannot accurately forecast such amounts  we do expect payments to trend downward in the future 
net sales to independent domestic distributors increased approximately to  in from  in the increase was due principally to a increase in custom and generic iv systems partially offset by a decrease in clave product sales because of lower unit volume 
the increase in sales of custom and generic iv systems was attributable to an increase in unit volume  approximately one third of the increase was from increased sales of custom iv systems incorporating the o valve 
the decrease in clave product sales was because of lower unit volume 
we believe the decline in sales of clave products is principally because of acquisition of market share by abbott and b 
braun 
we expect a continued decrease in the net sales of standard clave products to the independent domestic distributors  but expect that the decrease will be at least partially offset by sales of custom and generic iv systems  including custom iv systems incorporating the o valve  and new products such as the clc there is no assurance that we will achieve increased net sales to independent domestic distributors in the future 
further  the ability of the independent distributors to sustain or increase their sales may be impacted by competition from existing and new competitive products or acquisition of market share by abbott and b 
braun 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in  as compared with  in those amounts do not include distribution in canada we now have distribution arrangements in the principal countries in western europe  the pacific rim and south america and in south africa 
approximately of international sales in were to distributors selling in western europe  approximately in south africa  approximately in the pacific rim and approximately in latin america 
we expect significant increases in sales to foreign customers will continue in the future  although there is no assurance that those expectations will be realized 
total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to  in from  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over abbott accounted for of the growth in dollar sales of clave  international approximately  partially offset by the decline in b 
braun and independent domestic distributors 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to abbott and b 
braun  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted for by bulk  non sterile claves 
we expect continued significant growth in clave unit and dollar sales volume in  notwithstanding any decline in sales to b 
braun or independent domestic distributors because of the large growth that we expect with abbott and international distribution 
further  we expect the decline in average selling prices to abate somewhat from the decline rates of the past several years 
however  we give no assurance that the expectations will be realized 
net sales of custom and generic iv systems were  in compared to  in sales of non proprietary and generic iv sets accounted for substantially all of the net increase 
net sales of the clc were approximately the same in as they were in the decline in sales to abbott was offset by increased sales to domestic and foreign distributors 
we expect sales of the clc to increase in and later years  but there is no assurance as to the amount or timing of future clc sales 
net sales of the lopez valve decreased in to  on lower unit volume to domestic and international distributors 
we had expected sales to increase in  but we believe that the focus of the sales and marketing efforts of our personnel and those of our distributors on other products diluted the sales of the lopez valve 
we are making improvements to the product and expect sales to increase in net sales of protected needle products increased slightly  as increased sales of the mcgaw protected needle offset decreased sales of click lock and piggy lock products 
we expect sales of these products will decrease in the future as the safe connector market continues its shift to needleless technology 
gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the results of our continuing extensive efforts to improve manufacturing efficiency and the increased absorption of overhead by higher production volumes offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
we expect that gross margins for custom and generic iv systems and certain other manually assembled products will be lower than those we have historically achieved because their production is relatively labor intensive 
we expect that our unit production costs will continue to decrease in  but that the gross margin percentage will be slightly lower than that ultimately achieved for the full year  as average unit sales prices continue to decrease  and manually assembled products become a greater percentage of the company s sales 
electrical energy costs at our manufacturing facilities in the second half of continued to moderate somewhat from the first and second quarters of  but were still approximately double what they were in the first quarter of  the last quarter before the sharp rate increase experienced since may most of the increase was because of rate increases 
electrical energy costs were approximately of sales in the second half of  down from of sales in the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of we are unable to predict what those costs will be in  but do not expect them to increase to the levels of the first half of there has been no interruption in service 
the significant uncertainty as to the availability of electrical energy in california has abated  although there is still uncertainty as to future costs 
any further significant increase in electrical costs or a significant interruption in service could have an adverse effect on our operations 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in sg a costs were of net sales in compared to in spending increased for litigation and administrative costs 
sales and marketing costs increased  but decreased as a percentage of sales 
we expect sg a costs to increase in  because of growth in the company  promotional costs of new products  international expansion  and expansion of the custom and generic iv system business 
research and development r d costs decreased in by  to  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in spending on new product development including development of automated production machinery in was lower than in  as was spending on clinical evaluations of the clc  which we believe are nearing completion 
costs of software development to support manufacturing and distribution of custom and generic iv systems increased in we estimate that r d costs will continue in at approximately the same percentage of net sales as in however r d costs could differ from those estimates and the r d may not be completed as expected 
we plan to launch  in limited markets  a new iv connector currently under development 
we expect to apply in the first half of to the fda under section k of the fdc act for approval to market this new connector 
there is no assurance that the fda will grant marketing clearance  that we will launch this new product  or that it will achieve sales if and when we commence marketing it 
the operating margin increased to in  compared to in  principally because operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
investment income decreased by  in  notwithstanding an increase in the investment portfolio  because of the effect of declines in interest rates since the beginning of our effective income tax rate in was  down from in principally because of state tax credits 
we expect our effective tax rate in to be approximately the same as the rate 
net income in increased from principally because the gross profit increased  but operating expenses increased only 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income  principally because the increased average number of shares outstanding 
comparison of to in  we had net sales of  which was  or  higher than the net sales of  reported in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of clave products  including custom clave iv systems 
net sales to abbott were  in  compared to  in the increase was principally because of an increase in unit sales of clave products  with most of the balance of the increase in the clc and clave custom iv systems 
net sales to b 
braun  including revenue sharing  amounted to  in  compared to  in net sales of clave products increased approximately  while sales of the mcgaw protected needle decreased and safeline revenue sharing payments decreased approximately  or 
net sales to independent distributors increased approximately from  in to  in increases were registered in sales of custom iv systems  clc and lopez valves  offset by a decline in clave products and protected needle products 
total sales to foreign distributors were  in compared to  in those amounts do not include distribution in canada 
approximately of international sales were to distributors in europe 
total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased approximately to  in from  in unit shipments of clave products in increased approximately over abbott accounted for of the growth in dollar sales of clave  b 
braun accounted for and international approximately  partially offset by the decline in independent domestic distributors 
the aggregate average net selling price of clave products in decreased approximately as compared with that decrease reflects lower prices from independent distributors and lower prices on bulk  non sterile clave products sold to abbott and b 
braun  as well as a higher percentage of the sales mix being accounted for by bulk  non sterile claves 
net sales of custom iv systems were  in compared to  in most of the increase in net sales was because of increased unit shipments of custom iv sets incorporating the clave 
net sales of the clc increased from  in to  in most of the increase was sales to abbott  with most of the balance of the increase on sales to independent domestic distributors 
net sales of the lopez valve in decreased from those in  because cr bard  inc  who had signed a contract to buy lopez valves in purchased virtually no lopez valves in sales to domestic and foreign distributors were up approximately in over net sales of protected needle products decreased approximately because of the safe connector market s continued shift to needleless technology 
gross margin for was unchanged from the registered in the results of our continuing extensive efforts to improve manufacturing efficiency and the increased absorption of overhead by higher production volumes offset the effect of lower average unit selling prices 
sg a costs increased by  or  to  in  compared to  in spending increased for administrative and litigation costs  while sales and marketing costs were relatively unchanged 
r d costs increased in by  to  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  in spending in was principally on clinical evaluations of the clc  software development for the custom iv systems business and setfinder and work on new products including development of automated production machinery 
the operating margin increased to in  compared to in  principally because sg a costs decreased as a percentage of net sales 
the company s effective income tax rate in was  as compared with in net income in increased from principally because the gross profit increased  but operating expenses increased only 
net income per share diluted increased  or 
the percentage increase in earnings per share was less than that for net income  principally because the increased average number of shares outstanding 
accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in applying those policies  estimates and judgments affect the amounts at which accounts receivable and inventory and certain liabilities are recorded and the useful lives of property and equipment 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
they could also affect the estimated useful levels of property and equipment  which could result in changes in depreciation expense or write offs or write downs of such assets 
liquidity and capital resources during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities excluding tax benefits from exercise of stock options and  from exercise of stock options including tax benefits  partially offset by  used to purchase property and equipment 
during  working capital increased approximately  to  from  the company s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  including liquid investments  increased by  to  from  that increase was due primarily to  of cash flows from operating activities excluding tax benefits from exercise of stock options and  from exercise of stock options including tax benefits  partially offset by  used to purchase property and equipment  and  used to acquire treasury stock 
capital expenditures increased in principally for investment in molding machines  molds and automated assembly machines  as well as recurring facilities improvements and acquisition of computer equipment and software 
we expect that capital expenditures in will be somewhat above those in for additional investments in molding machines  molds and automated assembly machines in san clemente  continuing acquisition of computer equipment and software  and new facilities outside of north america 
we expect that sales of our products will continue to grow in if sales continue to increase  accounts receivable and inventories are expected to increase as well 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect the use of working capital to fund our operations to continue to increase 
we have not purchased treasury stock since october  except for a small amount in march we may purchase additional shares in the future 
however  future acquisitions  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we believe that our existing working capital  supplemented by income from operations  will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and increased working capital requirements for the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in corporate preferred stocks and federal tax exempt state and municipal government debt securities 
the securities are all investment grade and we believe that we have virtually no exposure to credit risk 
dividend and interest rates reset at auction for most of the securities from between seven and forty nine day intervals  with some longer but none beyond twelve months  so we have very little market risk  that is  risk that the fair value of the security will change because of changes in market interest rates 
our future earnings are subject to potential increase or decrease because of changes in short term interest rates 
generally  each one percentage point change in the discount rate will cause our overall yield to change by two thirds to three quarters of a percentage point  depending upon the relative mix of federal tax exempt securities and corporate preferred stocks in the portfolio and market conditions specific to the securities in which we invest 
we do not have any significant foreign currency risk 
sales to foreign distributors are all denominated in us dollars 
cash and receivables in entities outside the united states  principally in mexico  which are denominated in foreign currency are insignificant and are generally offset by accounts of payable in the same foreign currency
