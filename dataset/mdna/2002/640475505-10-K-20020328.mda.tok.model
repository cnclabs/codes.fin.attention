item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should always be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in factors that may affect future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview neoforma is a leading healthcare supply chain and information solutions company 
we build and operate internet marketplaces that empower healthcare trading partners to optimize supply chain performance and we provide complementary solutions to our trading partners that enable them to increase the value they derive from our marketplaces 
our objective is to develop the industry standard supply chain operating system for healthcare 
our solutions enable the participants in the healthcare supply chain  principally healthcare providers  manufacturers  distributors and gpos  to significantly improve business processes within their organizations and among their trading partners 
these solutions consist of web based applications and services for our customers  or trading partners  that are designed to accelerate and optimize their use of the marketplaces that we build for them 
our trading partners include healthcare providers  including hospitals and idns and gpos  and the manufacturers and distributors that sell products and services to them 
historically  we have offered four primary services shop  auction  plan and services 
our shop service provided private marketplaces where buyers could easily identify  locate and purchase new products and suppliers could access new customers and markets 
healthcare providers could use our shop service to purchase a wide range of products  from disposable gloves to surgical instruments and diagnostic equipment 
our auction service created an efficient marketplace for idle assets by enabling users to list  sell and buy used and refurbished equipment and surplus medical products 
our plan service provided interactive content to healthcare facility planners and designers  including degree interactive photographs of rooms and suites in medical facilities that we believed represented industry best practices  together with floor plans and information about the products in the room 
our services organization provides scalable and cost effective implementation solutions for both healthcare providers and suppliers 
in late fiscal  we decided to refocus our development efforts and internal resources on our core business of building and operating internet marketplaces to optimize supply chain performance for our trading partners 
as part of this effort  we developed a plan to eliminate any operations that were not aligned with this core strategy 
as such  in early fiscal  we announced our intent to divest our auction operations and portions of our plan operations 
in april  we implemented part of this strategy by selling usl and fdi information resources  llc  or fdi  which together comprised substantially all of our plan operations  to mdsi and attainia  inc  or attainia  respectively 
in september  we completed the sale of our auction operations to med xs  which completed the divestitures we had planned to execute in as part of our refocused strategy 
during the fourth quarter of  in order to continue to maintain our focus on delivering core customer solutions and to increase our resource commitment to the more scalable acute care business  we obtained board approval to begin exploring strategic alternatives for our atlanta based alternate site healthcare business unit  neomd  which consists primarily of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  equipmd 
concurrently  we are continuing to streamline our organizational structure to increase operational efficiency in part by reallocating or eliminating internal assets focused on the alternate site healthcare business 
the costs relating to divesting the neomd operations  as well as the charge to write down the assets of the business to our estimate of the current fair market value  are reflected in our statement of operations for the period ended december  as costs of anticipated divestitures 
as part of our focus on our core business and the divestitures of a number of our non core operations discussed above  the nature and mix of our revenue shifted substantially during the year ended december  during  our revenue streams consisted of two primary types of revenue marketplace revenue and trading partner services revenue 
marketplace revenue is comprised of transaction and subscription based fees paid by the buyers and the suppliers of products on our marketplaces  as well as fees paid by marketplace sponsors such as gpos 
trading partner services revenue in consisted of revenue generated from the sale or license of complementary applications and services to users and potential users of our marketplaces 
trading partner services revenue historically has consisted of setup fees from participating sellers to digitize their product information for display on our website  subscription and transaction based fees paid by healthcare providers and suppliers for our management and disposition of their used medical equipment through our auction asset recovery service  product revenue related to the sale of medical equipment that we purchased for resale through our live and online auction services  sponsorship fees paid by sellers of medical products and services used in planning and outfitting healthcare facilities in exchange for the right to feature their brands and products on our now divested plan service  license fees from the sale of software tools and related technical information for the equipping and planning of healthcare facilities  and service delivery fees for implementation and consulting services paid by users of our marketplaces 
we recognize transaction fees as revenue when the seller confirms a buyer s order 
marketplace subscription fees are recognized ratably over the period of the related agreement with the applicable buyer or supplier 
setup fees have been recognized upon completion of the related services 
for live and online auction services  we recognized seller transaction fees  as well as a buyer s premium  when the product was sold 
product revenue  representing the difference between the amount we paid for the equipment and the price paid to us on resale  was recognized when the product was shipped or delivered  depending on the shipping terms associated with each transaction 
as a result of our divestiture of our auction operations  we do not expect to recognize any revenue from live and online auction services or product revenue in sponsorship and subscription fees related to our divested plan operations were recognized ratably over the period of the agreement 
with respect to software licenses  license fees are recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no other contingencies related to our performance 
if license fees are contingent upon our performance subsequent to delivery  we defer recognition of such fees or the fair market value of the undelivered element requiring performance until we have completed performance 
subscription and maintenance fee revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the service agreement 
services revenue for implementation projects are generally fixed fee arrangements  and as a result of the nature of the projects  we recognize such fees on a completed contract basis 
revenue for other services  including training and consulting  is recognized as services are performed for time and material arrangements 
for most other fixed fee arrangements  we use the percentage of completion method based on labor input measures when appropriate  and in cases where percentage of completion is not feasible  we defer recognition of the revenue in its entirety until the contract is completed 
we are continuing to identify new potential revenue opportunities within the scope of our core strategy of developing and operating internet marketplaces 
we have identified opportunities to develop and sell additional products and services into our existing customer base that will provide significant value to trading partners using our marketplaces and could represent significant future revenue opportunities 
in connection with this strategy  we have refocused our efforts on identifying opportunities to license the proprietary technology that we have developed and are developing for internal use as part of our marketplace development efforts 
while licensing these internally developed software and technology solutions has been part of our core strategy  only recently have our marketplaces achieved volume levels sufficient to validate our technology and enable us to pursue technology licensing opportunities 
while our sale of certain software and technology underlying our connectivity solution to ghx in august was the first such sale of our proprietary  internally developed software  we intend to continue to market our technology solutions to other marketplace providers and participants in the healthcare industry  as well as in other vertical markets 
both our revenue and operating expenses increased significantly over the course of fiscal we generated increased revenue from the growth of our marketplace revenue primarily due to higher transaction and subscription fees resulting from increased volume through marketplace novation  our largest marketplace 
the increase in operating expenses during was primarily due to increases in our amortization of partnership costs relating to our outsourcing and operating agreement with novation  vha  uhc and hppi  increased costs of anticipated divestitures resulting from the write down of the assets of our neomd business in conjunction with our plans to divest the business and increased costs incurred to write down certain non marketable investments and intangible assets 
strategic partnerships under the terms of our outsourcing and operating agreement  which was approved by our stockholders on july   vha received approximately million shares of our common stock  representing approximately of our then outstanding common stock  and uhc received approximately million shares  representing approximately of our then outstanding common stock 
we also issued warrants to vha and uhc  allowing vha and uhc the opportunity to earn up to approximately million and approximately  additional shares of our common stock  respectively  over a four year period by meeting specified performance targets 
these performance targets are based upon the historical purchasing volume of vha and uhc member healthcare organizations that sign up to use marketplace novation  which is available only to the patrons and members of vha  uhc and hppi 
the targets increase annually to a level equivalent to total healthcare organizations representing billion of combined purchasing volume at the end of the fourth year 
under our outsourcing and operating agreement  we have agreed to provide specific functionality to marketplace novation 
novation has agreed to act as our exclusive agent to negotiate agreements with suppliers to offer their equipment  products  supplies and services through our marketplaces  subject to some exceptions 
vha  uhc  hppi and novation have each agreed not to develop or promote any other internet based exchange for the acquisition or disposal of products  supplies  equipment or services by healthcare provider organizations 
in october  we and vha agreed to amend our common stock and warrant agreement to provide for the cancellation of the performance warrant to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
in substitution for the warrant  we issued to vha approximately million shares of our restricted common stock 
on january   we and uhc agreed to amend our common stock and warrant agreement to provide for the cancellation of the remaining unexercised portion of the performance warrant to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
in substitution for the warrant  we issued to uhc approximately  shares of our restricted common stock 
both vha s and uhc s restricted shares are subject to forfeiture if the same performance targets that were contained in their original warrants are not met 
in january  we entered into an amendment to the outsourcing and operating agreement 
under the terms of the amended outsourcing and operating agreement  which was effective as of january   novation agreed to guarantee a minimum fee level to us  which is based on a percentage of the gross marketplace volume processed through marketplace novation  subject to certain performance criteria on our part 
the amended outsourcing and operating agreement also includes modifications to revenue sharing provisions under which we agreed to share specified fees we receive for products and services sold through or related to our marketplaces 
we agreed to share with novation revenue related to transactions through marketplace novation and from our other marketplaces as well as revenue related to the distribution or licensing of software and other technology solutions 
we do not share revenue related to marketplaces sponsored by other gpos  except for specified types of purchases 
for the term of the amended outsourcing and operating agreement  we will not share with novation revenue related to any of the above transactions in any quarter until we have achieved specified minimum transaction fees related to marketplace novation transactions 
the amended outsourcing and operating agreement also includes modifications to certain supplier recruitment and supplier implementation provisions of the original agreement 
in september  the parties agreed to amend the amended outsourcing and operating agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  all parties agreed to expand the definition of marketplace volume to include supply chain data captured for marketplace member purchasing when the actual transaction itself was not handled through the marketplace 
as a result  we will be able to provide to our trading partners within marketplace novation information relating to all purchases made by members from suppliers that have agreed to participate in marketplace novation  thereby enhancing our ability to capture this critical supply chain data 
this revision enables us to capture important purchasing information without first requiring full adoption of our connectivity services 
in january  we entered into stock purchase agreements with vha  uhc and i technologies under which they purchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
we raised a total of million prior to costs associated with the sale of the shares  which were million  including an advisory fee to our investment bankers 
after the closing of the financing  vha and uhc owned and  respectively  of our then total shares of outstanding common stock  assuming exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
divestitures as a result of the then planned divestitures of our auction and usl operations  at december   we wrote down the assets of those operations to our estimate of the net realizable disposal value of the operations based on their activity through that date 
additionally  we recorded an accrual for the anticipated costs to sell these operations 
the total impact of these planned divestitures on our statement of operations for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of a million reduction in the net realizable value of the assets relating to the operations to be sold and million of accruals for anticipated deal costs  including any severance for the employees of those operations  accrued rent relating to potentially idle facilities  as well as financial and legal advisory fees 
as of december    of the accrual had been utilized for severance and other employee related costs associated with the divestitures 
the remaining  accrual consists primarily of accrued rent relating to idle facilities formerly utilized by the divested businesses 
in april  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our usl operations to mdsi 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we agreed to transfer substantially all of the net assets of the usl operations  totaling approximately  in exchange for  of cash delivered upon the closing and a  non interest bearing promissory note payable in annual installments over five years 
the net result of the transaction was a gain on the divestiture of the usl operations of  in april  we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining assets of our plan operations  valued at approximately million  to attainia  a company created by several former neoforma employees  including the two founders of neoforma 
in consideration  we received  shares of attainia s series a preferred stock  valued at per share  which resulted in consideration of  being provided to us upon closing 
these shares are recorded as non marketable investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the net result of the transaction was a loss on the divestiture of these assets of million 
in september  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our auction operations to med xs in exchange for consideration in the amount of million 
we agreed to contribute million of net assets  consisting of  of tangible assets  including inventory and fixed assets  and million of intangible assets  net of approximately  of eliminated liabilities 
the consideration provided by med xs at closing on september  consisted of  cash and a million promissory note payable over two years 
in addition to the consideration discussed above  we will receive a revenue share and profit share from med xs on the sold business  which will be recognized when earned 
the net result of the transaction was a gain on the divestiture of these assets of  to date  we have received only the closing amount of  from med xs 
in january  we filed suit against med xs for failure to make any subsequent payments due under the promissory note 
as of december   we believe that the full amount is collectible and as such  we have not recorded any valuation allowance against this note 
as a result of the planned divestiture of our neomd operations  at december   we wrote down the assets of the operations to our estimate of the net realizable disposal value of the operations based on its activity through that date 
additionally  we recorded an accrual for the anticipated costs to sell the operations 
the total impact of this planned divestiture on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  was million  which consisted of an million reduction in the net realizable value of the assets relating to the operations to be sold and  of accruals for anticipated deal costs  including any severance for the employees of those operations  accrued rent relating to potentially idle facilities and any financial and legal advisory fees 
as of december   none of this accrual had been utilized 
other matters in august  as part of our annual meeting of stockholders  the stockholders voted to approve a proposal to change our name from neoforma 
com  inc to neoforma  inc 
additionally  the stockholders voted to approve a proposal that gave the board of directors the authority to implement a reverse stock split of our common stock at any one of three approved exchange ratios for  for or for if it believed that it was in our best interests to do so 
on august   we implemented a for reverse split of our common stock as approved by our board of directors 
in december  we became aware of certain factors that indicated that the value of certain assets acquired as part of our acquisition of pharos in january had been impaired 
as a result of our impairment analysis  we determined that the intangible assets relating to the acquisition  which consisted primarily of acquired technology and intellectual property  had no future realizable value  primarily as a result of our pending discontinuation of the use of those technologies  combined with a lack of any identifiable market to sell those technologies 
as a result  as of december   we wrote off the remaining value of the intangible assets relating to the pharos acquisition  which amounted to million  as an impairment of intangibles 
since inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate our losses in will decrease as compared to fiscal as a result of several factors 
these factors include anticipated reductions in non cash charges such as amortization of intangibles  impairment of intangibles  costs of anticipated divestitures and write down of non marketable investments 
additionally  we anticipate a reduction in cash operating losses as a result of increasing revenue combined with relatively minimal increases in cash operating expenses 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the online market for the purchase and sale of new products and services used by healthcare providers  including medical supplies and equipment 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  increase the number of marketplaces we build and operate  expand the number of trading partners that use our marketplaces  enter into new strategic alliances  increase the functionality of our services  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  respond to competitive developments and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and our failure to do so could seriously harm our business 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue marketplace revenue related party 
related party marketplace revenue consists of payments for marketplace services from trading partners or marketplace sponsors that are also significant stockholders of neoforma 
for the years ended december  and  related party marketplace revenue consisted solely of payments from novation to us under the minimum fee level guarantee provisions of the outsourcing and operating agreement during those periods 
this revenue increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result of increased marketplace volume through marketplace novation  which increased from million in to billion in other 
other marketplace revenue consists of marketplace revenue received from trading partners  marketplace sponsors and other sources that are not related parties and generally consists of transaction based fees and subscription fees 
other marketplace revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of our shop services in  partially offset by an increase in revenue from our neomd marketplace and from the initiation of supplier paid fees through marketplace novation 
trading partner services revenue trading partner services 
trading partner services revenue consists of revenue generated from the sale of complementary applications and services to members and potential members of our marketplaces 
historically  trading partner services revenue consisted of the following setup fees to digitize product information  subscription and transaction based fees for management and disposition of used medical equipment through our asset recovery service  historically known as auction  sponsorship fees paid by sellers to feature their brands and products on our now divested plan service  license fees from the sale of software tools and related technical information  and services revenue for implementation and consulting services paid by users of our marketplaces 
the decrease in trading partner services revenue from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  was primarily due to reduced revenue from the usl business as a result of the sale of usl in april  reduced revenue from our other plan operations as a result of the sale of those operations to attainia in april  and reduced transaction fee revenue from our asset recovery services as a result of the sale of the auction operations in september these reductions were partially offset by revenue relating to the sale of rcs to ghx that was recognized during sales of used equipment 
sales of used equipment consisted of the gross revenue generated from the sales of used and refurbished medical equipment that we owned as part of our auction service 
we had total sales of used equipment of  for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  the decrease is a direct result of our entering into an agreement to sell the auction operations in july and the subsequent closing of the sale and the cessation of auction activities in september because we have sold our auction operations  we do not anticipate that we will recognize any future revenue from sales of used equipment 
operating expenses cost of equipment sold 
cost of equipment sold consists solely of the costs of owned inventory of used medical equipment held for sale as part of our auction operations 
cost of equipment sold decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the sale of the auction operations in the third quarter of because of the sale of our auction operations  we do not anticipate that we will incur any future expense relating to cost of equipment sold resulting from the sale of used equipment 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of the costs to perform e commerce readiness services and buyer and supplier implementation activities for our marketplaces 
these expenditures consist primarily of technology costs  software licenses  salaries and other personnel expenses for our services personnel and fees for independent contractors 
cost of services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the fact that the services group was created early in fiscal  resulting in minimal costs for a significant portion of that period as the group was still building its operations 
additionally  in  the services organization significantly expanded both the quantity and the scope of the implementations and services it provides to our customers  resulting in further increased costs in we expect our cost of services to increase slightly in future periods as we continue to perform e commerce readiness services  connect both buyers and sellers to our marketplaces and support and service an increasing number of trading partners 
operations 
operations expenses consist primarily of expenditures for the operation and maintenance of our marketplaces and our marketplace technology infrastructure  including customer service 
these expenditures consist primarily of fees for independent contractors and consultants  technology costs  software licenses  salaries and other personnel expenses for our operations personnel 
operations expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in operations personnel related costs  an increase in payments to third party consultants and increased expenditures for additional technology costs  such as software licenses and hardware costs  associated with the enhancement of the infrastructure of our marketplaces 
we expect our operations expenses to continue to increase as we expand our operating infrastructure and add content and functionality to our marketplaces 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and technology costs associated with software and hardware development  as well as fees to consultants and contractors  associated with the development and enhancement of our marketplace solutions and functionality 
product development expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced costs relating to product development personnel  specifically with respect to contractors and consultants 
we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as such  we intend to continue to invest in this area 
as a result  we expect product development expenses to increase slightly in future periods 
internally generated software development costs that were potentially eligible for capitalization  after consideration of factors such as realizable value  were not material and accordingly were expensed as incurred 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  advertising  promotions and related marketing costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing personnel costs and a resulting reduction in expenses related to travel and attendance at trade shows 
as part of our realignment of resources to focus on our core business model  we have been focusing the majority of our resources on product development and marketplace implementation and integration efforts 
as a result  sales and marketing costs were at significantly lower levels in as compared with we do not expect these costs to remain at these reduced levels in we recognize that sales and marketing efforts are key to establishing ourselves as a leader in our industry and in branding our products  and as a result  we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing activities and sell our marketplace services into the channels we have established 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing costs to increase slightly over the next several quarters 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses for executive and administrative personnel  facilities  professional services and other general corporate activities 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced administrative personnel costs  including finance  accounting and administrative personnel  as well as a decrease in recruiting  legal and accounting expenses 
these reductions were primarily the result of the fact that in fiscal  we divested several of the operations we acquired during the previous year  including the usl and fdi operations  and we incurred the full administrative costs of those entities during fiscal also  in we incurred costs resulting from preparations for our initial public offering  which occurred in january given the organizational changes and divestitures we have made to streamline our operations and to focus on our core strategy  we expect general and administrative expenses to continue at these lower levels in amortization of intangibles 
intangibles include goodwill and the value of software and other intangibles purchased in acquisitions 
intangibles historically have been amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to seven years 
amortization of intangibles increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of a full year of amortization on the equipmd intangible assets in fiscal  as opposed to only eight months of amortization taken in fiscal as a result of the acquisition closing at the end of april this was offset by the fact that we incurred reduced amortization from the usl and fdi intangibles as a result of the divestitures of those operations during the second quarter of additionally  we incurred significantly reduced amortization relating to the general asset recovery  llc  or gar  and national content liquidators  inc  or ncl  intangibles as a result of the write down we took on the auction operations in the fourth quarter of in preparation for the sale of the auction operations and because we amortized the reduced intangibles for only a portion of the year as a result of the closing of the sale of the auction operations during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the pharos intangibles and effectively all of the intangibles relating to the acquisition of equipmd as a result of our plans to divest the equipmd business 
as such  we have no material acquisition related intangibles remaining to be amortized as of december   and combined with the recent release of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which modifies the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets  we do not expect to incur any amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in future periods 
amortization of partnership costs 
amortization of partnership costs represents the amortization of the capitalized valuation of consideration given to strategic partners as part of entering into any operating relationships with those partners 
to date  capitalized partnership costs represented common stock and warrants issued to vha and uhc in connection with entering into the outsourcing and operating agreement with those entities and with their purchasing organization  novation  as well as certain legal and accounting fees relating to entering into the agreement 
we subsequently canceled the warrants issued to vha and uhc and issued them restricted common stock in substitution for the canceled warrants 
the value of the common stock issued is being amortized over a five year estimated useful life 
the restricted common stock issued in substitution for the warrants is being valued  and the related valuation is being capitalized  as the shares are earned 
the capitalized partnership costs relating to the restricted common stock are being amortized over the term of the agreement with the healthcare organizations that resulted in the shares being earned  generally two to three years 
amortization of partnership costs increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase from fiscal was primarily the result of the amortization of a full year of partnership costs compared to approximately five months for the year ended december   as the outsourcing and operating agreement did not become effective until late july in addition  there were incremental partnership costs capitalized during fiscal as vha and uhc earned a portion of the restricted stock 
as the period over which vha and uhc can earn the restricted common stock extends four years from the date of the agreement  we expect partnership costs to continue to increase as vha and uhc earn the restricted stock and  as a result  we expect the amortization of partnership costs to continue to increase for the next several quarters 
see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of the outsourcing and operating agreement and the related cash and accounting implications 
amortization of deferred compensation 
deferred compensation represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the cost to the employee of equity based compensation and the estimated fair value for accounting purposes of the underlying equity instrument 
in the case of stock options  deferred compensation is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of the underlying stock on the date the option was granted 
this type of deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years  based on an accelerated vesting method 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees during fiscal  and  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
in may  we decreased this deferred compensation by million as a result of a reduction in workforce related to restructuring activities 
additionally  during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in additional reductions of this deferred compensation as a result of normal employee attrition 
we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in connection with the assumption of certain stock options granted to employees of equipmd prior to our acquisition of equipmd  we recorded deferred compensation of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of announcement of the acquisition 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using an accelerated method of amortization 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation related to these options of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in december  in connection with the award of restricted stock to certain employees and officers  we recorded deferred compensation of million  representing the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
the restrictions on the stock lapse on june  for the officers and on february  for the other employees  subject to continuous employment with neoforma through those dates 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and will be amortized ratably over the period from the date of grant through the vesting date using the straight line method of amortization 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation related to these shares of  during the year ended december  the remaining total deferred compensation of million at december  is expected to be amortized as follows million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal the amortization expense relates to options and restricted stock awarded to employees and officers in all operating expense categories 
the amount of deferred compensation has been separately allocated to these categories in the consolidated statement of operations 
the amount of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could continue to decrease if options or restricted stock for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
write off of acquired in process research and development 
during the year ended december   we expensed million and million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the pharos acquisition and the equipmd acquisition  respectively 
there were no such write downs during the year ended december abandoned acquisition costs 
abandoned acquisition costs in consisted primarily of legal  accounting  investment banking and other costs incurred as a result of the termination of the agreement and plan of merger  dated march   between neoforma and eclipsys  inc and the agreement and plan of merger  dated march   between neoforma and healthvision  inc abandoned acquisition costs were million for the year ended december  there were no such costs during the year ended december restructuring 
restructuring costs consist primarily of the costs associated with the payments to employees for severance resulting from the streamlining and reorganizing of our operations in the first half of fiscal as a result of our transaction with novation and acquisition of equipmd in early fiscal  we streamlined our operations to focus on two key global markets  idns and hospitals  and physician practices 
the restructuring involved both changes in executive management and our organizational structure as well as a reduction in force of approximately individuals in functions largely duplicative or unnecessary as a result of both the novation agreement and the reorganization 
restructuring costs were million for the year ended december  there were no such costs during the year ended december  impairment of intangibles 
impairment of intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of our investment in pharos to our current estimate of its fair market value as of december  during fiscal  we were unsuccessful in our efforts to identify a buyer for the technology we acquired as part of our acquisition of pharos 
in addition  we have decided to terminate our internal use of the technology acquired 
these factors caused us to conclude that the carrying value of the intangibles was not recoverable as of december  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of to write off these intangible assets 
costs of anticipated divestitures 
costs of anticipated divestitures consist of costs and charges we incurred that are the direct result of pending divestitures of certain of our operations and generally relate to any charges required to adjust the carrying value of the assets to be divested to fair value  as well as anticipated deal costs and post divestiture costs relating to the business  such as rent on idle facilities  severance  legal and financial advisory fees and other ongoing costs 
in the fourth quarter of  our management  working with our board of directors  finalized a plan to refocus our operations on building and managing private internet marketplaces for our trading partners 
as part of this process  we announced our intention to divest two of our operations that were not aligned with that strategy 
the operations to be divested were auction  which consisted primarily of gar and the assets acquired from ncl  as well as our usl subsidiary 
in accordance with this plan  we wrote down the assets of both operations to the estimated net realizable disposal value based on the activity through december  additionally  we recorded an accrual for the anticipated costs to sell these two operations 
the costs of anticipated divestitures of million for the year ended december  consisted of a million of reduction in the net realizable value of the assets relating to the operations to be sold to reflect the estimated disposal value and million of accruals for anticipated deal costs 
as of december   the remaining accrual relating to these costs was during the fourth quarter of  in order to continue to maintain our focus on delivering core customer solutions and to increase our resource commitment to the acute care business  we obtained board approval to begin exploring strategic alternatives for the divestiture of our neomd operations 
these operations consist primarily of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  equipmd 
as a result of this plan  we wrote down the assets of these operations to the estimated net realizable disposal value based on activity through december  we wrote down the assets  which primarily consisted of goodwill and other intangible assets  by million to reflect our estimate of their realizable disposal value as of december  additionally  we booked an accrual for  for anticipated post divestiture costs 
as of december   none of this  accrual had been utilized 
write down of non marketable investments 
in september  we received notice from pointshare  inc that it was in the process of selling its remaining assets and winding down its operations 
pointshare was a privately held business to business administration services company in which we invested million in march based on our subsequent discussions with pointshare s management  we felt that it was highly unlikely that we would recover any material portion of our initial investment 
as such  we wrote off our million investment in pointshare during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off our million investment in careportal 
com  llc  or careportal  formerly known as intramedix  llc  a privately held corporation 
over the course of fiscal  we continued to narrow the focus of our operating efforts to the acute care market and specifically refocused our operations on private marketplaces for trading partners 
this fact  combined with uncertainties regarding the financial position of careportal  the resulting decline in our estimate of the fair market value of this investment  the lack of visibility on the ultimate recoverability of our investment and our belief that the decline in value was other than temporary in nature  led us to conclude that the investment in careportal had no future realizable value as of december  gain on divested businesses 
gain on divested businesses consists of the net gain incurred as a result of the divestitures of the usl  fdi and auction operations during the year ended december  the gain on divested businesses is calculated by reducing the consideration paid to us for the divested operations by the net book value of all assets and liabilities transferred with the divested operations 
the divestiture of usl resulted in a gain of  the divestiture of fdi resulted in a loss of million and the divestiture of the auction operations resulted in a gain of  the resulting net gain on divested businesses during the year ended december  was  other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest and other income and expense 
interest income decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due to the decrease in our average net cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of our utilization of cash to fund our operations in fiscal and interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due primarily to interest costs associated with our line of credit with vha 
other income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase in other income was primarily the result of the cancellation of  of debt under our note payable to the original owner of the gar business 
this  was cancelled by the former owner of the gar business in connection with the termination of his employment during fiscal income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  which will be available to reduce future taxable income 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to our lack of earnings history 
federal and state tax laws impose significant restrictions on the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that we may utilize in a given year

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue marketplace revenue related party 
related party marketplace revenue consists of payments for marketplace services made from trading partners or marketplace sponsors that are also significant stockholders in neoforma 
for the year ended december   related party marketplace revenue was comprised solely of payments from novation to us under the minimum fee level guarantee provisions of the outsourcing and operating agreement during that period 
this revenue increased from for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to the fact that the operating and outsourcing agreement was not entered into until the middle of fiscal as a result  there was no such revenue in  as compared to those amounts generated from novation in other 
other marketplace revenue consists of marketplace revenue received from trading partners  marketplace sponsors and other sources that are not related parties and generally consists of transaction based fees and subscription fees 
such revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher shop transaction fees as well as revenue recognized from our neomd marketplace that resulted from our acquisition of equipmd in early trading partner services revenue trading partner services 
trading partner services revenue consists of revenue generated from the sale of complementary products and services to members and potential members of our marketplaces

sales of used equipment consisted of the gross revenue generated from the sales of used and refurbished medical equipment that we owned as part of our auction service 
we had total sales of used equipment of million for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the increase from fiscal is due to the fact that auction activity for periods prior to fiscal consisted solely of sales of consigned medical equipment  which we did not own 
as a result  revenue related to consigned equipment was recognized  net of settlement costs  as transaction fees and was included in trading partner services revenue 
in fiscal  as part of our acquisition of some of the assets of ncl  the auction service expanded the scope of its operations to include hospital liquidations in which we purchased and took title to the used equipment of a hospital being liquidated in order to sell that equipment through the auction channel

these expenditures consist primarily of fees for independent contractors and consultants  technology costs  software licenses  salaries and other personnel expenses for our operations personnel

intangibles historically have been amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three to seven years 
amortization of intangibles increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was a result of a full year of amortization incurred on the acquisition of gar in august and fdi in november  as well as the amortization of intangibles relating to our acquisitions of pharos in january  usl in march  equipmd in march and some of the assets of ncl in july amortization of partnership costs 
amortization of partnership costs represents the amortization of the capitalized valuation of consideration given to strategic partners as part of entering into any operating relationships with those partners 
to date  capitalized partnership costs represented common stock and warrants issued to vha and uhc  in connection with entering into the outsourcing and operating agreement with those entities and with their purchasing organization  novation  as well as certain legal and accounting fees relating to entering into the agreement 
we subsequently canceled the warrants issued to vha and uhc and issued them restricted stock in substitution for the canceled warrants 
the value of the common stock issued is being amortized over a five year estimated useful life 
the restricted common stock issued in substitution for the warrants is being valued  and the related valuation is being capitalized  as the shares are earned 
the capitalized partnership costs relating to the restricted common stock are being amortized over the term of the agreement with the healthcare organization which resulted in the shares being earned  generally two to three years 
for the year ended december   total amortization of partnership costs was million 
as we did not enter into the outsourcing and operating agreement until july  there was no amortization of partnership costs for the year ended december  amortization of deferred compensation 
deferred compensation represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the cost to the employee of equity based compensation and the estimated fair value for accounting purposes of the underlying equity instrument 
in the case of stock options  deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years  based on an accelerated vesting method 
in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees during fiscal  and  we recorded deferred compensation of million in total

this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using an accelerated method of amortization 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation related to these options of million during the year ended december  the remaining deferred compensation of million at december  was and will be amortized as follows million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories 
the amount of deferred compensation has been separately allocated to these categories in the consolidated statement of operations 
cost of warrant issued to recruiter 
for the year ended december   we recorded million related to the valuation of a warrant issued to an executive search firm in connection with services rendered in the search for our chief executive officer 
no such costs were incurred in the year ended december  write off of acquired in process research and development 
during the year ended december   we expensed million and million  respectively  related to the write offs of acquired in process research and development in connection with the pharos acquisition and the equipmd acquisition 
there were no such write offs during the year ended december abandoned acquisition costs

abandoned acquisition costs were million for the year ended december  there were no such costs during the year ended december  restructuring 
restructuring costs consist primarily of the costs associated with the payments to employees for severance resulting from the streamlining and reorganizing of our operations in the first half of fiscal as a result of our transaction with novation and acquisition of equipmd  in early fiscal we streamlined our operations to focus on two key global markets  idns and hospitals  and physician practices 
the restructuring involved both changes in executive management and our organizational structure as well as a reduction in force of approximately individuals in functions largely duplicative or unnecessary as a result of both the novation agreement and the reorganization 
restructuring costs were million for the year ended december  there were no such costs during the year ended december  other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest and other income and expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was due to an increase in our average net cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of preferred stock financing in october and our initial public offering in january interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the interest associated with significantly higher levels of leases and notes payable outstanding throughout the year ended december  other income for the year ended december  was  income taxes

all amounts outstanding under this line of credit  both principal and interest  are due and payable on may   if not repaid sooner 
in the event that we sell any of our stock as part of an equity financing  obtain funding in connection with a debt financing or other lending transaction that is either unsecured or subordinate to the lien of vha under the credit agreement or enter into a debt financing or other lending transaction secured by assets we owned as of the date we entered into the credit agreement  then the maximum of million we could potentially borrow under the credit agreement will be reduced by an amount equal to the cash proceeds we receive from any of these transactions

in may  we entered into a leasing facility with capitalwerks  llc  or capitalwerks  to provide us with a million lease line facility to finance the purchase of capital equipment  software and other assets 
based on the terms of the facility  we had until november  to draw down against the lease line  at which time any amount unused under the facility was to be no longer available 
amounts financed under the lease line bear interest at and are payable in monthly installments over months 
at the end of the lease line term  when capitalwerks had not made available to us any amounts under the lease line  they agreed to extend the lease line for six months  until april  we believe  however  based on subsequent conversations with capitalwerks  and notwithstanding that a small borrowing was made in the amount of approximately  subsequent to december   that capitalwerks will not be able to fulfill its obligations to us to make available further borrowings under the lease line of credit on the terms agreed to in may we are currently in discussions with capitalwerks regarding what we believe to be their failure to fund their commitments under the lease line  and capitalwerks has made alternate credit proposals to us  to which we have not agreed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach any agreement with capitalwerks or that any further fundings will be made available to us

net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  related primarily to funding net operating losses and a decrease in accounts payable  which was partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to the purchase of equipment to operate our marketplaces and cash payments on a note issued in connection with our acquisition of gar  partially offset by net sales of marketable investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to net proceeds from common stock issuances of million and from draws on our line of credit of million  partially offset by million in repayment of notes payable 
net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to the proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock in january we currently anticipate that our available funds  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  combined with those funds available to us through our line of credit and other sources  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  the timing of expanded service offerings  the success of these services once they are launched and our ability to adjust our operating expenses to an appropriate level if the growth rate of our business is slower than expected 
buyers and suppliers of products and services used by healthcare providers might not accept our business model of providing internet and electronic marketplaces for the purchase and sale of such products and services and  as a result  we may not succeed in increasing our revenue to the extent necessary to be cash flow positive during and beyond 
any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our available funds and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements  or if an event of default occurs under our credit agreement with vha and we are required to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement  we would need to seek additional sources of funding  such as selling additional equity or debt securities or obtaining additional lines of credit 
we would also likely need to curtail expansion of our services  including reductions in our staffing levels and related expenses  or potentially liquidate selected assets 
if our management decides that it is in our best interest to raise cash to strengthen our balance sheet  broaden our investor base  increase the liquidity of our stock or for any other reason  we may decide to issue equity or debt  even if all of our current funding sources remain available to us 
if we issue additional securities to raise funds  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  effective for periods beginning after december  eitf issue no 
addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or b a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be included as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf issues no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  no 
 accounting for points and certain other time or volume based sales incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future and no 
upon application of these eitfs  financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes will be reclassified to comply with the income statement display requirements under this issue 
as a result of the application of these eitfs  we will net selected costs associated with our strategic partnerships against certain immaterial implementation revenue on a prospective and historical basis due to the relationships between those strategic partners and the trading partners being implemented 
given the immaterial amounts this revenue represents  we believe the adoption of these pronouncements in will not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
it addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets  but not those acquired in a business combination  should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
sfas no 
also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over those lives 
we are currently analyzing the impact of sfas and expect to complete our analysis by the end of our fiscal quarter ended june  as of december   we do not have any material amounts of goodwill  but we do have other acquired intangible assets that could be affected by this statement 
we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review 
however  we cannot assure you that a material impairment charge will not result upon completion of the review 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no

sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we believe the adoption of this pronouncement in will not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable  estimating litigation reserves and other accrued liabilities  and valuation of intangible assets and non marketable investments 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from marketplace applications and services and from related trading partner applications and services 
marketplace revenue consists primarily of transaction based fees and subscription based fees 
trading partner services revenue  to date  primarily consists of software license and maintenance fees  sponsorship fees  subscription fees and implementation fees 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences might result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
transaction fees 
transaction fee revenue represents the negotiated percentage of the purchase price or gross marketplace volume of products sold through our marketplaces at the time an order originated by a buyer is confirmed or accepted by the supplier 
the gross marketplace value of a transaction is the price of a product as agreed to by the buyer and the supplier 
we recognize transaction fees on a net basis  as we do not believe that we act as a principal in connection with orders to be shipped or delivered by a supplier to a buyer because  among other things we do not establish the prices of products paid by buyers  we do not take title to products to be shipped from the supplier to the buyer  nor do we take title to or assume the risk of loss of products prior to or during shipment  we do not bear the credit and collections risk of the buyer to the supplier  and we do not bear the risk that the product will be returned 
subscription fees 
subscription fee revenue historically has related primarily to our usl operations  which generated subscription revenue from customers who purchased month  month and month subscriptions to their web based healthcare supply chain periodicals and data management services 
currently  we are generating subscription fees from buyers and suppliers on our marketplaces that prefer to pay a single annual subscription fee to participate in any given marketplace instead of transaction fees 
in all cases  we recognize subscription fees ratably over the period of the subscription agreement  as that is generally the period over which the services are performed 
software license and maintenance fees 
while we have had relatively immaterial amounts of software license revenue to date  we anticipate that we will generate increased software license revenue in future periods 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we will not bifurcate the fee and we will not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions in which no software is involved  we will apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally deem that delivery has occurred when the product has been delivered either directly to the customer or to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is payable under extended payment terms  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess the likelihood of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple elements for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
based on this approach  we defer a portion of revenue from the arrangement fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue is recognized upon acceptance  which is deemed to have occurred upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time we enter into a transaction  we assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work  either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if we determine that these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
sponsorship fees 
sponsorship fees were generated in fiscal and early fiscal as a result of our plan operations  under which healthcare manufacturers paid fees to sponsor portions of our website 
in turn  our website would showcase their products and key marketing information about their company 
with the divestiture of our plan operations in  we do not anticipate generating any sponsorship fee revenue in future periods 
we recognized sponsorship fee revenue as services were performed and billable according to the terms of the service arrangements 
implementation fees 
we generally recognize implementation fees  as they relate to the implementation of our e commerce solution  ratably over the term of the underlying agreement 
in the future  as we perform services in connection with the implementation of other software products  we will recognize revenue on a completed contract basis unless we are able to accurately estimate the amount of time required to complete the project and track the amount of work performed 
if we meet these requirements  we would be able to recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method 
if we utilize the percentage of completion method and actual costs to complete projects are materially different from management s estimates of those costs  the result could have an adverse impact on our recognizable revenue 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable our management must make estimates of the collectability of both our accounts receivable and our notes receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management also performs additional periodic analysis of the financial condition of debtors for which we hold notes receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers or debtors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  as of december   our notes receivable balance was million  net of allowance against notes receivable 
estimating litigation reserves and other accrued liabilities management s current estimated range of liability related to our pending litigation is based on claims for which our management is able to estimate the amount and range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position in the period such revisions are made 
valuation of intangible assets and non marketable investments we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  such as capitalized partnership costs  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following loss of a major supplier or marketplace sponsor  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and  as a result  in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review 
however  we cannot assure you that a material impairment charge will not result upon completion of the review 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in market value that is other than temporary  we would record an investment impairment charge 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of the entities underlying the investments  or shifts in our strategic focus could result in a reduction in  or an inability to recover  the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future

additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations may be seriously harmed by any of these risks 
if our trading partners do not accept our business model of providing internet and electronic marketplaces for the purchase and sale of products and services used by healthcare providers  demand for our applications and services may not develop and the price of our common stock may decline we have focused our efforts on building and operating internet and electronic marketplaces that aggregate buyers and suppliers of products and services used by healthcare providers  including medical supplies and equipment 
this business model is new and unproven and depends upon buyers and sellers in this market adopting a new way to purchase and sell products and services 
if buyers and sellers of products and services used by healthcare providers do not accept our business model  demand for our applications and services may not develop and the price of our common stock could decline 
buyers and suppliers could be reluctant to accept our relatively new and unproven approach  which may not be consistent with their existing internal organization and procurement processes 
buyers and suppliers may prefer to use traditional methods of buying and selling products and services  such as using paper catalogs and interacting in person or by phone with representatives of manufacturers or distributors 
even if buyers and suppliers accept the internet or other electronic communications as a means of buying and selling products  they may not accept e commerce marketplaces for conducting this type of business generally  or our marketplaces specifically 
instead  they may choose to establish and operate their own purchasing systems or exchanges to buy or sell products and services 
for example  a group of large suppliers of medical products  including abbott laboratories  baxter international  inc  ge medical systems  johnson johnson and medtronic  inc  have created a healthcare exchange  called ghx  for the purchase and sale of medical products 
in  ghx purchased a business to business exchange for the purchase and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical surgical products  devices and other laboratory products and services formed by four large distributors of medical products  amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health inc  fisher scientific international inc and mckesson hboc  inc 
reluctance of buyers and suppliers to use our marketplaces would seriously harm our business 
additionally  if suppliers do not accept our fee model  we may not be able to increase our revenue  which would have a serious negative impact on our business 
we have a history of losses  anticipate incurring losses in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability we have experienced losses from operations in each period since our inception  including a net loss of million for the year ended december  in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability  and while we expect to generate positive cash flow from our operations in the first fiscal quarter of  which we refer to as earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  profitability  we may thereafter incur substantial operating losses  primarily as a result of increases in costs and expenses relating to executing our strategy of building and operating internet marketplaces for our trading partners 
as a result  we may not be able to sustain ebitda profitability throughout the remainder of and thereafter 
even if we do achieve and sustain ebitda profitability  we will not achieve gaap profitability unless we are able to significantly increase our revenue while adequately controlling our operating expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable on a gaap basis 
our operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline our revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter because of a number of factors 
these factors include the amount and timing of payments to our strategic and technology partners  the timing of and expenses incurred in enhancing our marketplaces for new trading partner services  the number of new trading partners that sign up to use our marketplaces and our ability to connect them to our marketplaces  the timing and size of any future acquisitions  changes in the fees we charge users of our services  budgetary fluctuations of purchasers of medical products  supplies and equipment  and changes in general economic  political and market conditions  especially in light of recent terrorist activities 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts 
if this were to happen  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
in addition  as a result of our limited operating history  the emerging nature of our market and the evolving nature of our business model  we have had difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue 
we incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenue 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed 
we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfalls 
accordingly  a failure to meet our revenue projections would have an immediate and negative impact on operating results 
we rely on our relationship with our strategic partners to drive participation in our marketplaces we expect to rely significantly on our relationship with novation and  to a lesser extent  our relationship with medbuy  along with other strategic allies such as ghx  to bring buyers and suppliers to our marketplaces 
under our amended outsourcing and operating agreement  novation is our exclusive agent for signing up suppliers to participate in marketplace novation  subject to limited exceptions 
accordingly  we rely on novation to attract suppliers to marketplace novation and  if novation is unable to attract a sufficient number of suppliers  the value of marketplace novation to buyers will be substantially decreased and our business will suffer 
under the amended outsourcing and operating agreement  we must meet detailed functionality and service level requirements 
if we are unable to achieve these required levels of functionality within a required time period  we may be required to pay significant liquidated damages or the agreement could be terminated  which would seriously harm our business and financial results 
because we have focused our development efforts and internal resources to building and operating internet marketplaces and because we have a limited operating history in this new and rapidly evolving market  you may have difficulty assessing our business and future prospects in late  we decided to refocus our development efforts and internal resources to our core business of building and operating internet marketplaces for our trading partners 
because we have focused our business efforts in this manner and have a limited operating history in this business  it is difficult to evaluate our business and our future prospects 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether we will succeed in increasing the number of marketplaces that we operate  the number of trading partners that utilize our marketplaces or the revenue we will derive from our marketplaces 
we currently derive the substantial majority of our revenue from marketplace novation  and  because of the lack of penetration into the canadian marketplace  we are currently in discussions with medbuy to restructure our relationship and our strategy in the canadian marketplace 
these are the only two marketplaces that we currently operate and we have not yet succeeded in establishing additional marketplaces 
our business will be seriously harmed  and may fail entirely  if we do not successfully execute our business strategy or if we do not successfully address the risks we face 
in addition  because of our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations are not meaningful 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future capital needs  we may be unable to develop new internet or electronic marketplaces or enhance the functionality of our existing marketplaces  expand our operations  respond to competitive pressures or continue our operations as of december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and approximately million in outstanding borrowings and notes payable  including million outstanding under our credit agreement with vha 
even if our line of credit with vha remains available to us  we may need to raise additional funds within the next twelve months if  for example  we do not generate significantly increased revenue from our marketplaces  experience larger than anticipated operating losses or pursue additional acquisitions 
we believe that it would be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing shares of our common stock  which could dilute our existing stockholders and may cause our stock price to decline 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to develop new marketplaces or enhance our existing marketplaces  expand our operations  respond appropriately to competitive pressures or continue our operations 
if an event of default were to occur under the vha credit agreement  vha could terminate the credit agreement and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would likely need to obtain an alternate source of funding  such as another credit line or an equity or debt financing  to repay amounts due under the credit agreement 
if we were unable to obtain alternate funding under these circumstances  our business would be seriously harmed and we could be forced to cease operations 
although we entered into a lease line of credit in may with capitalwerks  we have had very limited success in accessing any funds under this line of credit  and we may not be able to access any funds from this line of credit in the future 
because of our relationship with novation  other gpos may be reluctant to engage us to build new marketplaces we believe that we must establish relationships with gpos in addition to novation to increase our ability to build new marketplaces 
gpos represent groups of buyers in the negotiation of purchasing contracts with sellers and  consequently  have the ability to significantly influence the purchasing decisions of their members 
our relationship with novation could make it more difficult to attract other gpos to engage our services 
the inability to enter into and maintain favorable relationships with other gpos and the hospitals they represent could impact the breadth of our customer base and could harm our growth and revenue 
one of the largest gpos  premier inc  has a long term  exclusive agreement for e commerce services with one of our competitors  medibuy 
com  inc we must continue to develop the capability to integrate our marketplaces with enterprise software systems of buyers and suppliers of products and services used by healthcare organizations and continue to enable our marketplaces to support customer specific pricing  or these entities may choose not to utilize our marketplaces  which would harm our business if we do not maintain and expand the functionality and reliability of our marketplaces  buyers and suppliers of products used by healthcare providers may not use our marketplaces 
we must continue to develop the capability to integrate our marketplaces with enterprise software systems used by many suppliers of products and by many large healthcare organizations 
we may incur significant expenses in developing these capabilities and may not succeed in developing them in a timely manner 
in addition  developing the capability to integrate our marketplaces with suppliers and buyers enterprise software systems will require the continued cooperation of and collaboration with the companies that develop and market these systems 
suppliers and buyers use a variety of different enterprise software systems provided by third party vendors or developed internally 
this lack of uniformity increases the difficulty and cost of developing the capability to integrate with the systems of a large number of suppliers and buyers 
failure to provide these capabilities would limit the efficiencies that our marketplaces provide and may deter many buyers and suppliers from using our marketplaces  particularly large healthcare organizations 
to realize the benefits of our agreements with novation and medbuy  we will be required to integrate the systems of the healthcare organizations purchasing through novation s and medbuy s programs 
if the costs required to integrate these systems are substantially higher than anticipated  we may not realize the full benefit of these agreements 
if we were delayed or unable to integrate the systems of these organizations  our revenue would be adversely affected 
in addition  under the novation and medbuy agreements  we must meet detailed functionality and service level requirements 
to the extent we are unable to or are delayed in providing this functionality  we may be unable to attract buyers and suppliers to our marketplaces  and our revenue may be adversely affected 
we will be required to incur significant costs in providing functionality to our marketplaces and in integrating buyers and suppliers to our marketplaces prior to receiving any transaction fee revenue  and we may never generate sufficient revenue to offset these costs 
if our systems are unable to provide acceptable performance as the use of our marketplaces increases  we could lose trading partners that use our marketplaces  and we would have to spend capital to expand and adapt our network infrastructure  either of which could harm our business and results of operations we have processed a limited number and variety of transactions on our marketplaces compared to the number and variety we expect to process in the future 
our systems may not accommodate increased use while providing acceptable overall performance 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network infrastructure to accommodate additional trading partners and increased marketplace volumes  which will be expensive 
if our systems do not continue to provide acceptable performance as use of our marketplaces increases  our reputation may be damaged and we may lose trading partners that use our marketplaces 
we expect that a significant portion of the products and services used by healthcare providers that are sold through our marketplaces will come from a limited number of key manufacturers and distributors  and the loss of a key manufacturer or distributor could result in a significant reduction in the revenue we generate we expect that a significant portion of the products to be sold through and revenue to be generated from our marketplaces will come from a limited number of key manufacturers and distributors or as a result of purchases made from these manufacturers and distributors 
if any of these key manufacturers or distributors cease doing business with us  the revenue we generate through our marketplaces would be significantly reduced 
our supplier agreements are nonexclusive and  accordingly  these suppliers can sell their products  supplies and equipment to buyers directly or through our competitors 
we may make acquisitions  which could harm our profitability  put a strain on our resources or cause dilution to our stockholders we may decide that it would be in our best interests to make acquisitions to acquire new technologies  expand our product offering  or for other reasons 
integrating newly acquired organizations and technologies into our company could be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
in addition  we may lose current users of our marketplaces if any acquired companies have relationships with competitors of our users 
consequently  we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not timely add product information to our marketplaces or if that information is not accurate  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose users of our marketplaces we have undertaken to enter product information into our database and categorize the information for search purposes 
if we do not do so in a timely manner  we will encounter difficulties in expanding our marketplaces 
timely entering of this information in our database depends upon a number of factors  including the format of the data provided to us by suppliers and our ability to accurately enter the data in our product database  any of which could delay the actual entering of the data 
if we fail to input data accurately  our reputation could be damaged  we could lose users of our marketplaces  and we may incur liability 
additionally  we have undertaken to cross reference our product information with appropriate vendor and contract identifiers to ensure that we can properly track the transactions we process 
failure to adequately develop this cross reference over time could impede our ability to grow our marketplace volume and collect fees from suppliers 
we face significant competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we may be unable to maintain or expand the base of buyers and suppliers of products using our marketplaces and we may lose market share or be required to reduce prices the healthcare supply chain market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of the healthcare supply chain 
competitors include e commerce providers that currently have or have announced plans for online marketplaces targeted at the healthcare supply chain  including medibuy 
com  inc and broadlane  inc  healthcare exchanges that have been formed by suppliers  namely ghx  which was founded by five healthcare manufacturers  suppliers that have created their own websites that offer e commerce functions to their customers for the sale of their products and services  enterprise resource application software vendors that offer solutions in the healthcare market  such as lawson  mckesson  oracle  peoplesoft  and sap ag  vendors establishing electronic marketplaces and procurement capabilities  including ariba and commerce one  inc  and supply chain software vendors  including manugistics group  inc and logility  inc we believe that companies in our market compete to provide services to suppliers based on brand recognition  number of buyers using their services and the volume of their purchases  level of bias  or perceived bias  towards particular suppliers  existing relationships  compatibility with suppliers existing distribution methods  the amount of the fees charged to suppliers  functionality  ease of use and convenience  ability to integrate their services with suppliers existing systems and software  and quality and reliability of their services 
in addition  we believe that companies in our market compete to provide services to buyers based on brand recognition  breadth  depth and quality of product offerings  ease of use and convenience  number of suppliers available through their marketplace  ability to integrate their services with buyers existing systems and software  quality and reliability of their services  and customer service 
competition is likely to intensify as our market matures 
as competitive conditions intensify  competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established healthcare  medical products and internet companies  secure services and products from suppliers on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  secure exclusive arrangements with buyers that impede our sales  and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development 
our current and potential competitors services may achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
our existing and potential competitors may have longer operating histories in the healthcare supply chain market  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
as a result of these factors  our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services and make more attractive offers to buyers and suppliers  potential employees and strategic partners 
in addition  new technologies may increase competitive pressures 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand our buyer and supplier base or retain our current buyers and suppliers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors  and competition could seriously harm our revenue  gross margins and market share 
if we are unable to maintain our strategic alliances or enter into new alliances  we may be unable to increase the attractiveness of our marketplaces or provide satisfactory services to users of our marketplaces our business strategy includes entering into strategic alliances with leading technology and healthcare related companies to increase the number of marketplaces we build and operate  increase the number of trading partners that utilize our marketplaces  increase the number and variety of products and services that we offer and provide additional functionality  services and content to our trading partners 
we may not succeed in entering into new strategic alliances  and even if we do succeed  we may not achieve our objectives through these alliances 
for example  we are currently in discussions with medbuy to restructure our relationship and our strategy in the canadian marketplace  and we may not succeed in restructuring this relationship in a manner that is satisfactory to us 
in addition  we have not yet succeeded in establishing new strategic alliances to increase the number of marketplaces that we build and operate 
our alliances do not  and future relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant for their business 
these companies may pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire services that compete with our services 
in addition  in many cases these companies may terminate these relationships with little or no notice 
if any existing alliance is terminated or we are unable to enter into new alliances with leading technology and healthcare related companies  we may be unable to increase the attractiveness of our marketplaces or provide satisfactory services to buyers and suppliers of products and services 
if we are not able to increase recognition of the neoforma brand name  our ability to attract users to our marketplaces will be limited we believe that recognition and positive perception of the neoforma brand name in the healthcare industry are important to our success 
we intend to continue to invest in advertising and publicity efforts in the future 
however  we may not achieve our desired goal of increasing the awareness of the neoforma brand name 
even if recognition of our name increases  it may not lead to an increase in the number of users of our marketplaces or an increase the number of our trading partners 
if participating suppliers on our marketplaces do not provide timely and professional delivery of products and services  buyers may not continue using our marketplaces suppliers deliver the products and services sold through our marketplaces to buyers 
if these suppliers fail to make delivery in a professional  safe and timely manner  then our marketplaces will not meet the expectations of buyers  and our reputation and brand will be damaged 
in addition  deliveries that are non conforming  late or are not accompanied by information required by applicable law or regulations could expose us to liability or result in decreased adoption and use of our marketplaces 
if suppliers do not provide us with timely  accurate  complete and current information about their products and comply with government regulations  we may be exposed to liability or there may be a decrease in the adoption and use of our marketplaces if suppliers do not provide us in a timely manner with accurate  complete and current information about the products they offer  promptly update this information when it changes and provide us with accurate and timely invoicing data  our database will be less useful to buyers 
we cannot guarantee that the product information available from our marketplaces will always be accurate  complete and current  or that it will comply with governmental regulations 
this could expose us to liability if this incorrect information harms users of our services or results in decreased adoption and use of our marketplaces 
we also rely on suppliers using our marketplaces to comply with all applicable governmental regulations  including packaging  labeling  hazardous materials  health and environmental regulations and licensing and record keeping requirements 
any failure of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations could expose us to civil or criminal liability or could damage our reputation 
because some of the participants in our marketplaces are stockholders or are affiliated with our stockholders or have strategic relationships with us  we may find it difficult to attract competing companies  which could limit the breadth of products offered on and users of our marketplaces some participants in our marketplaces are our stockholders or are affiliated with our stockholders or have strategic relationships with us 
for example  vha and uhc  the owners of novation  own approximately million and million shares of our common stock  respectively 
in addition  vha and uhc own approximately million shares and million shares  respectively  of restricted common stock which was subject to restrictions upon issuance  and of which a portion is still subject to those restrictions 
these relationships may deter other gpos  suppliers or users  particularly those that compete directly with these participants  from participating in our marketplaces due to perceptions of bias in favor of one party over another 
this could limit the number of marketplaces we operate  the array of products offered on our marketplaces  damage our reputation and limit our ability to maintain or increase the number of our trading partners 
we may be subject to litigation for defects in products supplied by sellers using our marketplaces  and this type of litigation may be costly and time consuming to defend because we facilitate the sale of products by sellers using our marketplaces  we may become subject to legal proceedings regarding defects in these products  even though we generally do not take title to these products 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  or divert management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to attract qualified personnel or retain our executive officers and other key personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
we may not be able to compete effectively to retain and attract employees 
as a result  our employees may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
should we fail to retain or attract qualified personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry  and our business would be harmed 
we believe that our ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend on the continued services of executive officers and other key employees 
our executive employment agreements do not prevent these executives from terminating their employment at any time 
as a result  our employees  including these executives  serve at will and may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
our growth and organizational changes have placed a strain on our systems and resources  and if we fail to successfully manage future growth and organizational changes  we may not be able to manage our business efficiently and may be unable to execute our business plans we have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow our business to execute our strategy 
our total number of employees grew from six as of december  to as of december   although the number of employees has not grown consistently 
for example  in may  we reduced the number of our employees from approximately to approximately  and the number of our employees has declined since that time largely due to the divestitures of some of our operations 
these changes  and the growth in the number of our trading partners and marketplace volume through our marketplaces  have placed significant demands on management as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources and controls 
any future growth or organizational changes would likely cause similar  and perhaps increased  strain on our systems and controls 
securities class action lawsuits in which we have been named relating to investment banking practices in connection with our initial public offering may prove costly to defend  and if we are found liable  may expose us to financial liability greater than we are able to sustain in july  we were named as a defendant in two securities class action lawsuits filed in federal court in the southern district of new york relating to our ipo by stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period from january   to december  since that time  additional lawsuits have been filed asserting federal securities claims arising from our ipo 
the lawsuits also name certain of the underwriters  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith  bear stearns  and fleet boston robertson stephens  as well as our chairman and ceo and our former cfo  as defendants 
the lawsuits contain substantially identical allegations  which are that the prospectus and the registration statement for the ipo failed to disclose that the underwriters solicited and received excessive commissions from investors  and that some investors in the ipo agreed to buy more shares of our common stock in the secondary market  at predetermined prices  in a scheme to artificially inflate the price of our common stock 
although we believe that the claims made against us and our current and former employees in these suits are without merit  they could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and resources and require us to pay significant damages 
our infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events  and if any of these events of a significant magnitude were to occur  the extent of our losses could exceed the amount of insurance we carry to compensate us for any losses the performance of our server and networking hardware and software infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation and our ability to process transactions  provide high quality customer service and attract and retain users of our services 
currently  our infrastructure and systems are located at one site with exodus  a division of cable and wireless plc  in sunnyvale  california  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes 
we also have a fail over system for marketplace transaction processing located in atlanta  georgia 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
we do not yet have a formal disaster recovery plan  although it is our intention to formulate one 
in addition  we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that could occur 
if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of the confidential information of the trading partners that use our marketplaces  these users may discontinue using our marketplaces a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of e commerce is the secure transmission of personally identifiable information of internet users as well as other confidential information over public networks 
if any compromise or breach of security were to occur  it could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
we use ssl  or secure sockets layer  an internet security technology  at appropriate points in the transaction flow and encrypt information on our servers to protect user information during transactions  and we employ a security consulting firm that periodically tests our security measures 
despite these efforts  a party may be able to circumvent our security measures and could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches and under certain contracts with marketplace participants would be liable for contractual damages due to security breaches 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may gain access to our technology  which could harm our business we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be harmed 
we rely on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we have applied for registration of several marks including neoforma and associated logos 
our trademark registration applications may not be approved or granted  or  if granted  may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
we may be subject to intellectual property claims and if we were to subsequently lose our intellectual property rights  we could be unable to operate our current business we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
any claims regarding our intellectual property  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and resources or require us to pay significant damages 
license agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  there has been an increase in the number of patent applications related to the use of the internet to perform business processes 
enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internet sector will become a greater source of risk as the number of business process patents increases 
the loss of access to any key intellectual property right  including use of the neoforma brand name  could result in our inability to operate our current business 
if we lose access to third party software incorporated in our marketplaces  we may not be able to operate our marketplaces we currently rely on software that we have licensed from a number of suppliers 
for example  we use software that we license from iplanet  inc to provide part of our website infrastructure  we use software that we license from oracle to support the underlying database needs of our marketplaces  we use software that we license from i technologies to further enable us to offer our trading partners the ability to automate and streamline the procurement process and we also license gentran software from sterling commerce for the processing of order transactions from our customers 
we will continue to rely on commercial software vendors where appropriate to speed the delivery of our solutions  while reducing the costs of custom code development and maintenance 
these licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the licensors may not continue to support or enhance the licensed software 
in the future  we expect to license other third party technologies to enhance our services  to meet evolving user needs or to adapt to changing technology standards 
failure to license  or the loss of any licenses of  necessary technologies could impair our ability to operate our marketplaces until equivalent software is identified  licensed and integrated or developed by us 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate licensed technology into our services or to adapt licensed technology to support our specific needs  which could similarly harm development and market acceptance of our services 
regulation of the internet is unsettled  and future regulations could inhibit the growth of e commerce and limit the market for our services a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet  such as user privacy  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet and the pricing  content and quality of services 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease or limit its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws and regulations could limit the market for our services 
in addition  existing laws could be applied to the internet  including consumer privacy laws 
legislation or application of existing laws could expose companies involved in e commerce to increased liability  which could limit the growth of e commerce 
federal and state legislation and regulation affecting the healthcare industry could severely restrict our ability to operate our business we are subject to federal and state legislation and regulation affecting the healthcare industry 
existing and new laws and regulations applicable to the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
legislation governing the distribution of health information has been proposed at both the federal and state level 
for example  the health insurance portability and accountability act of mandates the use of standard transactions and identifiers  prescribed security measures and other provisions within two years after the adoption of final regulations by the department of health and human services  or hhs 
some of the transactions at our marketplaces may involve surgical case kits or purchases of products for patient home delivery  these products may contain patient names and other health information subject to laws governing the distribution of health information 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation 
moreover  we may be restricted or prevented from delivering health information electronically 
other legislation currently being considered at the federal level could also negatively affect our business 
because we represent that our marketplaces meet these regulatory requirements  our success will also depend on other healthcare participants complying with these regulations 
a federal law commonly known as the medicare medicaid anti kickback law  and several similar state laws  prohibit payments that are intended to induce the acquisition  arrangement for or recommendation of the acquisition of healthcare products or services 
the application and interpretation of these laws are complex and difficult to predict and could constrain our financial and marketing relationships  including but not limited to our fee arrangements with suppliers or our ability to obtain supplier company sponsorship for our products 
the gpo industry is currently being subjected to a limited scope audit by the hhs office of inspector general to determine compliance with the medicare medicaid anti kickback law  in addition  the new york times has begun a publishing a series of articles critical of the gpo industry 
finally  a united states senate subcommittee has announced its intent to hold hearings in april regarding possible abuses by the gpo industry 
because anything detrimental to the core business of our gpo partners could adversely impact our business  negative substantive findings by any of these or future investigations could potentially impact our business and consequently our stock price 
if there are changes in the political  economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affects the purchasing practice or operation of healthcare organizations  or if there is consolidation in the healthcare industry  we could be required to modify our services or to interrupt delivery of our services the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulation of the healthcare organizations with which we do business could impact the way in which we are able to do business with these organizations 
in addition  factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses  consolidation in the healthcare industry and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  such as any increased regulation by the food and drug administration of the purchase and sale of medical products  could require us to make unplanned enhancements of our services  or result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce demand for our services 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry providers operate 
we do not know what effect any proposals would have on our business 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  competition to provide services to industry participants will become more intense and the importance of establishing a relationship with each industry participant will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions of our services 
if we were forced to reduce our fees  our operating results could suffer if we cannot achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 
our stock price and those of other technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and  accordingly  our stock price may continue to be volatile  which could negatively affect your investment the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in january and is significantly below the original offering price 
an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new services by us or by our competitors  departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant strategic relationships or trading partners  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition  stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies operating performance 
public announcements by companies in our industry concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause fluctuations in the market for stocks of these companies 
these fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance
