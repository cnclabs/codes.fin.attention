use of estimates and critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  accrual for markdowns and the valuation of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in the economic conditions in the retail industry could have an impact on these estimates and the company s actual results 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity allowances for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit  on open account  to its retail store customers  after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its retail store customers to make their required payments 
management bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
sales returns and allowances 
costs associated with potential returns of merchandise and charge backs are recorded as a reduction to net sales  and are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these costs are based upon known returns and allowances  historic trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out method for certain wholesale inventories and by the first in  first out method for retail and the remaining wholesale inventories 
the company marks down inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory 
management continually assesses the valuation of inventories by reviewing the costing of inventory  the significance of slow moving inventory  and the impact of current economic conditions 
accrual for markdowns 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net sales  and are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these costs result from seasonal negotiations with the company s retail store customers  as well as historic trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets  the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
the company recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
forward looking and cautionary statements this annual report contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on the company s current expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company finances its capital needs through available capital  future earnings  bank lines of credit and its long term debt which totals million  inclusive of its current portion 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is primarily in its investment portfolio and its short and long term borrowings 
the company  pursuant to investing guidelines  mitigates exposure on its investments by limiting maturity  placing investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
all of the company s indebtedness  including borrowings under its million lines of credit and long term debt  bear interest at variable rates 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
the company entered into a swap agreement  effective november   to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on its long term debt 
the swap agreement effectively converts the long term debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of per annum 
subsequent to year end  the swap agreement was assigned to another financial institution  which resulted in a reduced fixed interest rate of per annum
