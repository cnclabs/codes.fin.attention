item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of seebeyond technology corporation appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding anticipated costs and expenses  anticipated gross margins  mix of revenues and plans for introducing new products and services 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed below  under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were founded in and sold our first products and services in under the name software technologies corporation 
from to our sales and marketing efforts were primarily focused on customers in the healthcare industry 
in  we began to significantly increase our sales and marketing expenses to target customers in other vertical markets  such as financial services insurance  manufacturing  retail  telecommunications energy utilities and government 
as a result of these efforts  license sales to non healthcare customers accounted for approximately of our license sales in  of our license sales in  and of our license sales in in november  we launched the fourth generation of our primary product with the introduction of e gate software and changed the name of this product from datagate software to e gate software 
in anticipation of this release  we accelerated the growth of our product development  services and sales and marketing organizations 
we incurred significant losses in and  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in october  we changed our name to seebeyond technology corporation 
we derive revenues primarily from three sources licenses  services and maintenance 
we market our products and services on a global basis through our direct sales force  and augment our marketing efforts through relationships with systems integrators and technology vendors 
our products are typically licensed directly to customers for a perpetual term  with pricing based on the number of systems or applications the customer is integrating or connecting with our products 
we record license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  delivery of our products has occurred and no other significant obligations remain 
payments for licenses  services and maintenance received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we currently have sales offices in countries outside of the united states 
revenues derived from international sales have grown to in from of total revenues in we believe that international revenues will continue to be significant in future periods 
to date  we have not experienced significant seasonality of revenues 
however  we expect that our future results will fluctuate in response to the fiscal or quarterly budget cycles of our customers 
revenues from services include consulting and implementation services and training 
a majority of our customers use third party systems integrators to implement our products 
customers also typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials or fixed fee basis  and services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services  which are sold on a per student basis and for which revenues are recognized as the classes are attended 
customers who license our products normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a fixed term  which is typically months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
our costs and expenses are classified as cost of license revenues  cost of services revenues  cost of maintenance revenues  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
each category includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  bonuses  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees 
cost of license revenues includes the cost of third party licensed software embedded or bundled with our products 
cost of services revenues consists of compensation and related overhead costs for personnel engaged in implementation consulting and services and training 
cost of maintenance revenues includes compensation and related overhead costs for personnel engaged in maintenance and support activities 
for the year ended december   our gross margin was on our license revenues  on our services revenues and on our maintenance revenues 
we expect in the future to continue to earn substantially higher gross margins on our license and maintenance revenues compared to our services revenues 
as a result  our overall gross margin depends significantly on our revenues mix 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials  and expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions 
to date  all software product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
also included in our operating expenses are the amortization of alliance warrants and the amortization of stock compensation 
in order to increase both our company s and our products market presence  we entered into strategic alliances with computer sciences corporation csc in march  electronic data systems corporation eds in january and accenture in november we granted a warrant to each of these parties to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which becomes exercisable upon the achievement of various milestones  which include the creation of e gate software market offerings in the case of accenture and csc and the generation of seebeyond license revenues by selling licenses of our software products to third parties in the case of eds and csc 
these warrants expire from july to november  and have a per share exercise price of for accenture  for eds and for csc 
these warrants contain a significant economic disincentive for non performance  and accordingly  the fair value of these warrants was measured at the date of grant in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
using the black scholes option pricing model  we valued the warrants granted to accenture in at million and the warrants granted to eds and csc at million 
these amounts are included in additional paid in capital and are being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting periods of the warrants 
we recognized amortization of million  million and  for  and  respectively  and we expect to recognize additional amortization of  in the amortization of the alliance warrants is classified as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
in december  we extended the duration of the eds warrant agreement 
as a result  we remeasured the value of the warrant and related expense which is reflected in the results of operations for in march  we entered into a four year co marketing agreement with general motors corporation gmc and issued gmc a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires in march and  shares under the warrant were exercisable immediately 
the remaining  shares subject to the warrant are performance based and will vest and become exercisable over the month period following the issuance of the warrant  provided the warrant holder has achieved certain milestones related to providing certain sales and marketing support 
the vesting of these warrants is not contingent upon the sale of future licenses to gmc 
as of december   a total of  shares subject to the warrant were vested 
the unvested portion of the warrant was valued as of the date of issuance and is being amortized as a charge to operating expense over the term of the co marketing agreement 
the value of the unvested portion of the warrant will be adjusted in each reporting period based on changes in the fair value of the warrants until such date the warrants are fully vested 
there is no obligation for gmc to make future product purchases from us 
as a result of the december private placement of  shares of our common stock  the exercise price of this warrant was adjusted to per share pursuant to the original agreement and accordingly this warrant and related expense was remeasured using the new exercise price 
in connection with stock option grants to our employees  we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million through december   of which approximately million remains to be amortized as of december  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date the options were granted multiplied by the number of option shares granted 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  consistent with the method described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
we recognized amortization of deferred compensation expense of million in and million in the amortization of the remaining deferred stock compensation at december  will result in additional charges to operations through the amortization of stock compensation is classified as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations

license revenues were million for  million for and million for representing increases of million  or  from to  and million  or  from to license revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and for the increase in license revenues from to was due to continued licensed sales of e gate software and the introduction of our business to business and business process management product offerings which together comprise our business integration suite 
the increase in license revenues from to was due primarily to continued sales of our business integration suite  the increased acceptance of our products in key vertical markets and the expansion of our relationships with leading systems integrators 
services revenues 
services revenues were million for  million for  million for  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to services revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the increases in the absolute dollar amount of services revenues from to and from to were primarily due to the growth of consulting revenues associated with increased licensing revenues 
maintenance revenues 
maintenance revenues were million for  million for and million for  representing increases of million  or  from to and million  or  from to maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the increases in the absolute dollar amount of maintenance revenues from to and to were primarily due to increased license sales of our products and the renewals of prior period maintenance contracts which had increased consistent with the increase in our cumulative license revenues 
other revenues 
other revenues were for and and million for representing a decrease of million  or  from to other revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in and and in the decrease in other revenues from to was due to our decision to discontinue this service in the fourth quarter of costs and expenses cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the cost of third party licensed software embedded or bundled with our products 
cost of license revenues was million for   for and  for cost of license revenues  as a percentage of total revenues was in  and the increase in the cost of license revenues from to was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of products we sold that contain third party software embedded or bundled with our software product offerings 
this increase was also attributable to the increase in license revenues from to cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues was million for  million for and million for these increases in cost of services revenues were primarily due to increases in professional services staff and the related costs associated with increased revenues 
cost of services revenues as a percentage of total revenues was in  in and in the decreases in cost of services revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to and from to were primarily due to the decrease in services revenue in the overall mix of total revenues 
cost of maintenance revenues 
cost of maintenance revenues was million in  million in and million for cost of maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues was in  in and in the increases in the absolute dollar amount in cost of maintenance revenues from to and to were primarily due to increases in maintenance revenues and increases in support and maintenance headcount 
cost of other revenues 
cost of other revenues was for and and million for cost of other revenues as a percentage of total revenues was in and and in the decrease from to was due to our decision to discontinue the service associated with the generation of other revenues in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for  million for and million for research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the increases in the absolute dollar amount of research and development expenses from to and from to were primarily due to the increase in the number of software developers and quality assurance personnel to support our product development  documentation and quality assurance activities related to the development of current and future versions of our products 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our product suites  upgrade the performance of existing products and continue our investment in research and development efforts 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million for  million for and million for sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the increases in the absolute dollar amount in sales and marketing expenses from to and from to were due to the expansion of our domestic and international direct sales forces  the increase in marketing directly to specific vertical markets such as manufacturing  retail and telecommunications energy utilities and the increase in marketing staff  promotional and public relations activities and product and corporate communications 
during the second half of  we significantly reduced our sales and marketing expenses as a result of workforce reductions and other expense reductions 
we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars from the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of for the foreseeable future as we expand our domestic and international sales forces  expand our marketing staff  develop product marketing and awareness campaigns for both our company and our products and increase promotional activities 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for to be less than sales and marketing expenses recorded for general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for  million for and million for general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the increases in the absolute dollar amounts from to and from to were primarily due to hiring additional executive  finance  information technology and administrative personnel to support the growth of our business and worldwide infrastructure 
during the second half of we reduced our general and administrative expenses as a result of the workforce reductions 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars from the levels recorded in the fourth quarter of for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our global operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses for to be less than general and administrative expenses recorded in restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge of million for employee termination benefits and related costs 
at december   approximately  remained in accrued expenses 
the headcount reductions associated with this restructuring charge were made to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
the restructuring resulted in headcount reductions of approximately employees  which was comprised of sales and marketing staff  professional services staff  general and administrative staff and research and development staff 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was  in and in and the increase in amortization of goodwill was due to the acquisition of stc software technologies corporation schweiz  ag zurich in january in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  the company is required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july  amortization of sales and marketing warrants 
in connection with the grant of warrants to purchase shares of common stock to certain strategic alliance partners during and  we recorded deferred compensation related to the warrants of million in and million in  of which approximately million in  million in and  in was expensed as amortization of warrants 
in connection with the grant of a warrant to purchase shares of common stock to gmc during  approximately million was recorded as a reduction in revenue and approximately  was expensed as amortization of warrants in amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with stock option grants to employees and non employee directors during and  we recorded total deferred compensation of million  of which million in  million in and million in was expensed as amortization of stock compensation 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net primarily consists of interest income expense 
interest and other income expense  net  was approximately  in   in and  in the increase in interest and other income  net from to was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to larger average cash balances during as compared to the decrease in interest expense  net from to was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to larger cash balances as a result of the company s initial public offering in april income taxes in  a  provision was recorded for state  and foreign taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal and million for state  which expire through for federal and for state taxes 
we also had available tax credit carryforwards of million for federal and million for california  which expire through the united states tax laws contain provisions that limit the use in any future period of net operating loss and credit carryforwards upon the occurrence of certain events  including a significant change in ownership interests 
we had deferred tax assets  including our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits of approximately million as of december  the realization of benefits of the net operating loses and tax credits is dependent on sufficient taxable income in future years 
possible lack of future earnings or a change in the ownership of the company could adversely affect the company s ability to utilize its tax attributes 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of this asset 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million from million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december  the increase was due primarily to the company s common stock private placement completed in december net cash used in operating activities was  during the twelve months ended december   as compared with million in the same period in the previous year 
this decrease in cash used in operating activities reflects primarily decreases in net loss and increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenues  offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the twelve months ended december   as compared with million in the same period in the previous year 
the decrease primarily was due to lower capital expenditures due a smaller increase in headcount from to  as compared to from to  offset by increased capital expenditures as a result of the expansion of our office facilities in net cash provided by financing activities was million during the twelve months ended december   as compared with million in the same period in the previous year 
the higher amount in was due primarily to the completion of the company s initial public offering and a concurrent private placement in may  offset by the repayment of a note payable in and the completion of a private placement in december in may  the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share and realized proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and issuance costs  of approximately million 
concurrent with the initial public offering  the company completed the sale of  shares of common stock to a purchaser in a private placement at a price of per share and realized proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and issuance costs  of approximately million 
in september  the company also repaid  in its entirety  a million note payable it had with a lending institution  using a portion of the proceeds from its initial public offering 
in november  the company established a million line of credit facility with a lending institution that bears interest at an annual rate of either prime plus or the libor rate plus  payable monthly  and which was to expire may  in october  the company amended the credit facility to extend the expiration date through may  as of december   million was available under the credit facility and there were no borrowings outstanding 
the company may use up to  of the credit facility to issue letters of credit 
the credit facility is secured by intellectual property rights  accounts receivable and certain other assets and is subject to certain borrowing base restrictions 
the credit facility requires maintenance of certain financial covenants pertaining to key financial ratios 
the credit facility replaced a million line of credit facility with another lending institution that bore interest at an annual rate of prime plus  payable monthly  and would have expired on february  the outstanding balance on the replaced credit facility was repaid in may using a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering 
in october  the company s million equipment line with the same lending institution providing the credit facility was amended  reducing the maximum amount available for borrowing under the equipment line to million 
the equipment line bears interest at an annual rate of either prime plus  or the libor rate plus  payable monthly  and expires on november  the company could draw against the equipment line through november  interest is payable monthly and principal is payable in monthly installments commencing in december as of december   there was million outstanding under the equipment line 
the equipment line is secured by certain of our assets 
in december  the company completed the sale of  shares of common stock to purchasers in a private placement at a price of per share and realized proceeds  net of commissions and issuance costs  of approximately million 
the company anticipates continued growth in its operating expenses for the foreseeable future  particularly in sales and marketing expenses and  to a lesser extent  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  the company expects its operating expenses and capital expenditures to constitute the primary uses of its cash resources 
in addition  the company may require cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents and its expected cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  in the event there is reduced demand for the company s products and services in the future  the company s cash from operations could be negatively impacted 
thereafter  the company may need to raise additional funds  and it cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms  if at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no

eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and changes the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
under sfas no 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  sfas no 
 accounting for certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb no 
 was issued 
we adopted sfas no

in september  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments  as well as other hedging activities 
because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities  the adoption of these pronouncements did not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements

risks related to seebeyond you should carefully consider the risks described below in evaluating the other statements made herein 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
we have a large accumulated deficit  we may incur future losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred substantial losses since as we increased funding of the development of our products and technologies and expanded our sales and marketing organization 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we were profitable for the three months ended december   we may incur losses in future periods and we may not maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our products are often used by our customers throughout their organizations to address critical business problems 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including product benefits  the ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  the ability to accommodate increased transaction volumes and product reliability 
many customers are addressing these issues for the first time when they consider whether to buy our products and services 
as a result  we or other parties  including systems integrators  must educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our products and services 
in addition  the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
this commitment often requires significant technical review  assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within a customer s organization 
our sales cycle may vary based on the industry in which the potential customer operates and is difficult to predict for any particular license transaction 
the length and variability of our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict whether particular sales will be concluded in any given quarter 
if one or more of our license transactions are not consummated in a given quarter  our results of operations for that quarter may be below our expectations and the expectations of analysts and investors 
our operating results are highly dependent on license revenues from one software suite  and our business could be materially harmed by factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for this software suite 
substantially all of our license revenues have been  and are expected to continue to be  derived from the license of our business integration suite 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for our business integration suite by future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
our latest version of e gate integrator version  was launched in june if our competitors release new products that are superior to our business integration suite in performance or price  or if we fail to enhance our business integration suite and introduce new products in a timely manner  demand for our products may decline  and we may have to reduce the pricing of our products 
a decline in demand or pricing for our business integration suite as a result of these or other factors would significantly reduce our revenues 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial releases of our business integration suite 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenues 
in the future  we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis 
if new releases or products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  we could experience customer dissatisfaction or a delay or loss of revenues 
for example  the introduction of new enterprise and business applications requires us to introduce new e way adapters to support the integration of these applications 
our failure to introduce these or other modules in a timely manner could cause our revenues and market share to decline 
in addition  customers may delay purchases of our products in anticipation of future releases 
if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our revenues may decline 
moreover  as we release enhanced versions of our products  we may not be successful in upgrading our customers who purchased previous versions of our business integration suite to the current version 
we also may not be successful in selling add on modules for our products to existing customers 
any failure to continue to upgrade existing customers products or sell new modules  if and when they are introduced  could negatively impact customer satisfaction and our revenues 
our revenues will likely decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with our systems integration partners and other partners  who also have relationships with our competitors 
we have entered into agreements with a number of systems integrators for them to install and deploy our products and perform custom integration of systems and applications 
these systems integrators also engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing and implementation and support of our products than we would otherwise  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of the systems integrators 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these firms to recommend our products during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
these systems integrators are not contractually required to implement our products  and competition for these resources may preclude us from obtaining sufficient resources to provide the necessary implementation services to support our needs 
if the number of installations of our products exceeds our access to the resources provided by these systems integrators  we will be required to provide these services internally  which would increase our expenses and significantly limit our ability to meet our customers implementation needs 
a number of our competitors have stronger relationships with some of these systems integrators and  as a result  these systems integrators might be more likely to recommend competitors products and services instead of ours 
in addition  a number of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these systems integrators or have stronger systems integrator relationships based on specific vertical markets and  therefore  have access to a broader base of customers 
our failure to establish or maintain systems integrator relationships would significantly harm our ability to license and successfully implement our software products 
in addition  we rely on the industry expertise and customer contacts of these firms in order to market our products more effectively 
therefore  any failure of these relationships would also harm our ability to increase revenues in key commercial markets 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these relationships 
our operating results could be adversely affected if these efforts do not generate license and service revenues necessary to offset this investment 
our growth continues to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market and sell our products and develop new products may be harmed 
we must plan and manage our growth effectively in order to offer our products and services and achieve revenue growth and profitability in a rapidly evolving market 
we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have in recent years added a number of employees 
our growth has and will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources  and we may not be able to effectively manage our growth in the future 
furthermore  if our relationships with systems integrators succeed and we are able to penetrate additional commercial markets  we may need additional sales and marketing and professional services resources to support these customers 
the growth of our customer base will require us to invest significant resources in the training and development of our employees and our systems integration partners 
if these organizations fail to keep pace with the number and demands of the customers that license our products  our ability to market and sell our products and services and our ability to develop new products and services will be harmed 
to manage our business  we must continue to effectively manage our direct sales force  effectively manage our professional services organization  hire and retain qualified software engineers  improve our operational  financial and management controls  improve our reporting systems and procedures  enhance our management and information control systems  and effectively manage  train and motivate our workforce 
in addition  if we acquire or invest in other companies  we may experience further strain on our resources and face risks inherent in integrating two corporate cultures  product lines  operations and businesses 
our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues or gross margin may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues in a given quarter has been recorded in the final month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the final month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenues from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause a decline in our stock price 
we realize substantially higher gross margins on our license revenues compared to our services and maintenance revenues 
thus  our margins for any particular quarter will be highly dependent on our revenue mix in that quarter 
in our international markets  we have experienced some seasonality of revenues  with lower revenues in the summer months 
although this seasonality has not had a material impact on our operating results in the past  we cannot assure you that our operating results will not fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other international trends 
we record as deferred revenue payments from customers that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements 
since only a small portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly results depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenues in the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors for these or other reasons  our stock price would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
our markets are highly competitive and  if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
as a result of increased competition  we may have to reduce the price of our products and services  and we may experience reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenues and operating results 
our current competitors include vendors offering e business application integration  or eai  and traditional electronic data interchange  or edi  software products  as well as in house information technology departments of potential customers that have developed or may develop systems that provide some or all of the functionality of our business integration suite 
we may also encounter competition from major enterprise software developers in the future 
many of our existing and potential competitors have more resources  broader customer relationships and better established brands than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
some of our competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties  which could adversely affect our operating results 
revenues from the sale of products and services outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in revenues from the sale of products and services in the united kingdom as a percent of our total revenues were in and in we believe that revenues from sales outside the united states will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
we are exposed to several risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could result in increased expenses  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including imposition of currency exchange controls  applicable to our business or to the internet  which could result in increased costs of doing business overseas  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  political and economic instability  which could result in increasing governmental ownership or regulation of businesses or other instrumentalities of commerce  wage and price controls  higher interest rates and spiraling inflation  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and  consequently  our operating results 
a downturn in the general economy or an industry trend toward reducing or delaying additional information technology spending due to cost cutting pressures could reduce demand for our products and services 
we rely significantly upon customers making large information technology purchasing decisions as a source of revenue 
in  we experienced a general slow down in the level of capital spending by some of our customers due to the general economic downturn  which has adversely affected our revenues 
this slow down in capital spending  if sustained in future periods  could result in reduced sales or the postponement of sales to our customers 
there can be no assurance that the level of spending on information technology in general  or on business integration software by our customers and potential customers in particular  will increase or remain at current levels in future periods 
lower spending on information technology could result in reduced sales to our customers and could impair our operating results in future periods 
we could suffer losses and negative publicity if new versions or releases of our products contain errors or defects 
our products and their interactions with customers software applications and it systems are complex and  accordingly  there may be undetected errors or failures when our products are introduced or as new versions are released 
in the past we have discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction  which have resulted in additional product development expenses 
to date  these additional expenses have not been material 
these errors have resulted in product release delays  delayed revenues and customer dissatisfaction 
in the future we may discover errors  including performance limitations  in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
since many customers are using our products for mission critical business operations  any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business and generate negative publicity  which could have a negative impact on future sales 
although we maintain product liability and errors and omissions insurance  we cannot assure you that these policies will be sufficient to compensate for losses caused by any of these occurrences 
if our products do not operate with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers and keep pace with technological change  our business may fail 
we currently serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and networking platforms 
if our products fail to gain broad market acceptance due to an inability to support a variety of these platforms  our operating results may suffer 
our business depends on a number of factors  including the following our ability to integrate our products with multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our products as new versions of software applications are introduced  the portability of our products  particularly the number of operating systems and databases that our products can source or target  our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet standards  the integration of additional software modules under development with our existing products  and our management of software being developed by third parties for our customers for use with our products 
our industry is characterized by very rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we have also found that the technological life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
we believe that we must continue to enhance our current products and concurrently develop and introduce new products that anticipate emerging technology standards and keep pace with competitive and technological developments 
failure to do so will harm our ability to compete 
as a result  we are required to continue to make substantial product development investments 
the market for business integration software may not grow as quickly as we anticipate  which would cause our revenues to fall below expectations 
the market for business integration software is rapidly evolving 
we earn substantially all of our license revenues from sales of our business integration suite 
we expect to earn substantially all of our revenues in the foreseeable future from sales of our business integration suite and related products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for application integration and business integration solutions and seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for business integration software 
if this market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our revenues will be adversely affected 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  we may lose these rights and our business may be seriously harmed 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights to distinguish our product from our competitors products 
the unauthorized use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we currently have no issued patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws afford only limited protection 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others  causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights 
third parties may claim that we have infringed their current or future intellectual property rights 
we expect that software developers in our market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products in different software industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  prevent product shipment or cause delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
patent litigation in particular has complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties 
in the event an infringement claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business would be harmed 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed to us or are using their confidential or proprietary information 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenues 
we currently expect that our current cash resources  together with the net proceeds from this offering  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional equity financing  our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline 
if we engage in debt financing  we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and that force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios  any of which could harm our business 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things develop or enhance our products and services  maintain or expand our sales and marketing organizations  acquire complementary technologies  products or businesses  expand operations  in the united states or internationally  hire  train and retain employees  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenues and could seriously harm our business 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we depend on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  including our founder and chief executive officer  james t 
demetriades 
most of these persons are not bound by an employment agreement  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of these persons  other than mr 
demetriades 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key product development or sales and marketing personnel could adversely affect our future operating results 
in addition  we must attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  including sales personnel and software engineers 
we face significant competition for individuals with the skills required to develop  market and support our products and services 
we may not be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees 
if we fail to do so  our ability to compete will be significantly harmed 
we may be at risk of securities class action litigation due to volatility in our stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
in the future  we may be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
some provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three year terms and does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors 
our board of directors has the authority  without further action by our stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock 
in addition  our stockholders are unable to act by written consent 
these and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers and directors may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
our president and chief executive officer  james t 
demetriades beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of seebeyond and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company develops products in the united states and sells them in north america  europe  africa and the pacific rim 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our revenues could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from international customers 
in we incurred net losses of approximately  in  net gains of  in and net gains of  in due to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues from international customers represented of total revenues in our line of credit carries a floating interest rate based on the prime rate plus 
accordingly  we are subject to the risk of incurring additional interest expense should the prime interest rate increase in the future 
the interest rate on our line of credit as of december  was
