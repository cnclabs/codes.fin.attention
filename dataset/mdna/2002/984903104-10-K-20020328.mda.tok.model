item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are forward looking are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
see safe harbor statement and factors affecting future results sections following 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing on pages to results of operations sales xicor s sales are derived from two product groups  mixed signal products and memory products 
mixed signal product sales represent our core market 
memory product sales comprise xicor s legacy businesses of serial eeproms  which we are in the process of exiting  and parallel eeproms  which business we are retaining 
annual sales by product group were year ended december  in thousands mixed signal product sales memory product sales total sales xicor continued to progress with its transition to a differentiated product strategy in  with mixed signal products representing of total net sales 
overall economic and industry wide conditions were weak throughout  and while mixed signal sales were level sequentially in the first two quarters of  mixed signal sales declined in the second half of on lower unit sales 
during xicor completed the year with mixed signal product sales over million  or of total net sales and mixed signal sales growth of over memory product sales decreased year over year in compared to principally due to the serial eeprom business that xicor is in the process of exiting and  to a lesser extent  lower unit shipments of parallel eeproms 
memory product sales decreased in compared to primarily due to product mix and lower average selling prices 
xicor believes that will be a challenging year for the mixed signal business as the difficult industry conditions experienced in extend into serial eeprom sales were approximately million in and million in both and we expect serial eeprom sales to decline significantly in compared to as we plan to complete our exit from that business in as a result  we expect total sales for to be significantly below levels and anticipate xicor will incur losses in cost of sales and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  in and in as discussed below  cost of sales for the first quarter of included an million charge to write down inventories 
excluding the inventory write down  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 
compared to  the gross profit percentage excluding the inventory write down benefited from a shift in the product mix to a larger percentage of higher margin mixed signal and parallel eeprom sales and a smaller percentage of lower margin serial eeprom sales  the amortization of million of the deferred gain on the sale of the fab assets and lower costs associated with our shift to fully outsourced manufacturing 
the gross profit percentage improved in compared to primarily due to reduced depreciation expense due to the planned closure of the milpitas in house wafer fabrication plant 
in addition  the increased portion of sales generated from products manufactured at third party foundries during and the increased percentage of sales of higher 
table of contents margin mixed signal products during had a favorable impact on the gross profit percentage when compared to prior years 
cost of sales in included a million credit related to the amortization of the deferred gain on the fab sale 
the gross profit percentage is expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in product mix  product costs and average selling prices 
research and development research and development expenses amounted to million or of sales in  million or of sales in  and million or of sales in while research and development expenses increased as a percentage of sales in compared to due to the lower sales level  the dollar amount of research and development expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to lower personnel costs and spending controls 
research and development expenses were consistent as a percentage of sales in compared to selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million or of sales in  million or of sales in  and million or of sales in the year over year decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is due primarily to headcount reductions and lower commission expenses related to the decreased sales in  partially offset by increased legal costs associated with protecting xicor s intellectual property rights 
the year over year increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to resulted from increased commissions associated with the higher sales level  the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and intensified sales and marketing activities with the goal of increasing design wins of proprietary products 
restructuring and other non recurring costs year ended december  restructuring inventory write down total during xicor began to revise its manufacturing and procurement strategies to significantly increase outsourcing of wafer fabrication and product testing to overseas subcontractors and to streamline operations 
this change was in response to market conditions that made it more economical to outsource manufacturing 
based on the progress made on the outsourcing program during  in december xicor s board of directors decided to close its milpitas in house wafer fabrication facility during and use third party foundries for all of xicor s wafer fabrication production 
in connection with the planned closure of this facility  xicor recorded a million restructuring charge  consisting of a million non cash write down of the wafer fabrication plant assets  million for severance costs relating to a reduction in workforce  fab closure costs of million  idle facilities charges of million and equipment lease costs of million 
xicor began pursuing the sale of the milpitas manufacturing operations but believed at that time the most likely outcome would be a piecemeal sale of the equipment 
in november  xicor completed the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory to standard mems  inc standard mems for a gross purchase price of million 
during xicor utilized million of restructuring reserves 
related reductions in workforce of approximately employees  primarily in manufacturing and related support groups  occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of as a result of the sale of the fab  xicor incurred restructuring charges at levels significantly below amounts previously estimated and accrued 
the net restructuring credit of million recorded in consists of a reversal of million of costs originally included in the restructuring accrual not utilized due primarily to the sale of the fab to standard mems  partially offset by million principally related to additional workforce 
table of contents reductions that xicor identified and committed to in the fourth quarter of to streamline operations and further implement the company s outsourced manufacturing strategy 
at the time of the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory  xicor and standard mems also entered into a related foundry agreement for standard mems to become a xicor foundry 
the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory resulted in a net gain of million  which was recorded as a deferred gain on sale of fab assets 
xicor is amortizing the gain over two years  which is the minimum term of the foundry agreement 
cost of sales for and included a million and million credit  respectively  related to the amortization of the deferred gain on the sale of the fab assets 
in the first quarter of  xicor announced its plan to exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products and complete the move to fully outsourced test and assembly operations 
accordingly  xicor s first quarter results included an million charge to cost of sales to write down inventories to their net realizable value and a million restructuring charge 
the million restructuring charge consisted of million of severance related costs for an additional reduction in xicor s workforce of approximately employees  million of fixed asset write offs principally related to leasehold improvements in the facility that housed our test operation and million of other restructuring related costs 
estimated annual cost reductions of million associated with the completion of the restructuring plan are expected to mitigate the effect of lower memory product sales 
during  xicor reduced its workforce by approximately employees and utilized million of the restructuring reserve for related severance costs and million for other restructuring related costs 
the remaining reductions in workforce are planned to occur in the first half of at december   the restructuring accrual of million consisted of million of severance costs including costs to reduce the workforce by approximately employees primarily in sales and administrative groups and million of other costs associated with vacated sales offices 
interest interest expense decreased in compared to due to the sale of the milpitas wafer fabrication assets and payoff of related equipment lease debt in november  partially offset by increased interest expense and amortization due to xicor s november issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes and warrants 
interest expense decreased in compared to principally due to normal principal payments of outstanding lease debt 
interest expense will increase in compared to as the convertible subordinated notes and warrants will be outstanding for the full year 
interest income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
interest income increased in compared to due to an increase in the average balance invested caused primarily by funds generated from operating activities and the issuance of stock under employee stock plans and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
interest income is expected to decrease in compared to due to lower interest rates  partially offset by the higher average balance invested caused primarily by funds generated from the november issuance of convertible subordinated notes and warrants discussed below 
taxes the provision for income taxes for and consisted primarily of federal and state minimum taxes  which resulted from limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards  and foreign taxes 
no taxes were provided in due to the net loss 
net deferred tax assets of million at the end of remain fully reserved because of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of these assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   xicor had million in cash and cash equivalents 
corresponding balances at the end of and were million and million  respectively 
the increased cash balance at december  compared to the prior year end was principally due to the november issuance of million of convertible notes and warrants due  with semiannual interest payments on may 
table of contents and november of each year  commencing may  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at any time unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the net proceeds of the offering were million after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering of million 
in xicor used million of cash in operating activities including million associated with restructuring activities  million to invest in standard mems  million to repay long term obligations and million for net equipment purchases million of equipment purchases  net of million of equipment financing 
xicor generated million from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans 
in xicor generated million of cash from operating activities  million of proceeds from the sale of the wafer fabrication assets and inventory to standard mems and million from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans 
xicor used million to repay long term obligations and million for equipment purchases 
in xicor generated million of cash from operating activities and million from the issuance of stock under employee stock plans and used million to repay long term obligations and million for capital asset purchases 
during  xicor expects to use cash in operating activities including interest payments on the convertible note and costs associated with restructuring activities  to repay long term obligations and purchase equipment 
capital expenditures for are currently planned at approximately million and are primarily related to product design and equipment for product test development 
at december   xicor had entered into commitments for equipment purchases aggregating less than million 
minimum future lease payments under non cancelable leases as of december  were as follows million  million  million  million  million and million thereafter 
xicor has a line of credit agreement with a financial institution that expires march   provides for borrowings of up to million against eligible accounts receivable and is secured by all of xicor s assets 
interest on borrowings is charged at the prime lending rate plus and is payable monthly 
at december   approximately million was available to xicor based on the eligible accounts receivable balances and the borrowing formulas 
to date  no amounts have been borrowed under this line of credit 
management believes that currently available cash will be adequate to support xicor s operations for the next twelve months  and accordingly  management does not plan to renew the line of credit in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding in their calls on judgment 
we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition xicor s customers include original equipment manufacturers  distributors and contract manufacturers 
xicor recognizes revenue from sales when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales are reduced for estimated returns and adjustments 
we base these estimates on historical data and other known factors 
actual results could be different from our estimates resulting in future charges to earnings 
certain of xicor s sales to distributors are contractually subject to rights of return and price concessions on unsold merchandise 
because of frequent sales price reductions on standard products  the 
table of contents distributors return rights and rapid technological obsolescence in the industry  xicor defers recognition of such sales until the distributors sell the merchandise 
from time to time xicor terminates distributors  contractually eliminates their rights of return and price concessions or obsoletes parts in the distribution channel 
in such cases  xicor recognizes revenue after the distributors return rights lapse and the price is fixed 
amounts billed to the distributors  net of estimated price concessions  are included as accounts receivable and the related gross profit is deferred and reflected as a current liability until the revenue is recognized 
the amount of gross profit recognized by xicor in future periods could differ from the deferred income on shipments to distributors due to the distributors contractual rights of return and price concessions on unsold merchandise 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
accounts receivable at december  and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
each quarter we evaluate our inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are not valued and we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value 
product and technology transitions announced by xicor or its competitors  changes in the purchasing patterns of xicor s customers and distribution partners  or adverse global economic conditions may materially affect estimates of xicor s inventory reserve requirements resulting in additional inventory write downs 
during  xicor recorded an million charge to cost of sales to write down inventories to their net realizable value in connection with its plan to exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products 
non marketable securities in we invested million in a company whose stock is not publicly traded 
the cost method of accounting was used to account for this investment as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we assess the value of this investment principally by using information acquired from the investee  including historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in values that is other than temporary 
market conditions  the availability of private equity or poor operating results of the investee could result in our inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in the investment s current carrying value of million at december   thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
restructuring in connection with restructuring plans  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters  or future events  that are inherently uncertain 
among other items  we estimate the salvage value of assets impaired  which requires judgments concerning such factors as fluctuating equipment markets and timing and method of disposal and the cost and timing of closing leased facilities  which requires judgments concerning such factors as fluctuating real estate markets and timing of disposal 
in  xicor recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the decision to close the milpitas wafer fabrication facility 
in  xicor recorded a net restructuring credit of million consisting of million of costs originally included in the restructuring accrual not utilized primarily due to the unanticipated sale of the fabrication facility  partially offset by million related principally to 
table of contents additional workforce reductions to streamline operations and further implement xicor s outsourced manufacturing strategy 
in  xicor recorded a million restructuring charge associated with the move to fully outsourced test and assembly operations and the exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products 
income taxes management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
xicor has net deferred tax assets of million at december  that remain fully reserved because of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of these assets 
in the event xicor determines that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be recorded as a credit to income in the period the determination is made 
contingencies and litigation from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances 
changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statements nos 
and fas and fas  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas replaces apb and eliminates pooling of interests accounting prospectively 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
fas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under fas  goodwill will be evaluated annually and to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
fas and fas are effective for all business combinations completed after june  the company believes that adoption of fas and fas in the first quarter of will not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
in august  fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations was issued 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fas applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company expects that the initial application of fas will not have an impact on its financial statements 
in october  fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
the objectives of fas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fas no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established by fas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
fas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company expects that the initial application of fas will not have a material impact on its financial statements 

table of contents safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the belief that will be a challenging year for the mixed signal business as the difficult industry conditions experienced in extend into  the expectation for serial eeprom sales to decline significantly in compared to  the plan to complete our exit from the serial eeprom business in  the expectation that total sales for will be significantly below levels  the anticipation that xicor will incur losses in  the expectation that the gross profit percentage will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in product mix  product costs and average selling prices  the expected workforce and cost reductions from xicor s restructuring plans  the expectation that interest income will decrease in compared to due to lower interest rates  the expectation to use cash in  and the expectation that currently available cash will be adequate to support operations for the next twelve months 
except for historical information  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following  general economic conditions and conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  fluctuations in customer demand  including loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  product mix  competitive factors such as pricing pressures on existing products and the timing and market acceptance of new product introductions both by xicor and its competitors  xicor s ability to have available an appropriate amount of low cost foundry production capacity in a timely manner  our foundry partners timely ability to successfully manufacture products for xicor using xicor s proprietary technology  any disruptions of our foundry relationships  manufacturing efficiencies  the ability to continue effective cost reductions  currency fluctuations  the timely development and introduction of new products and submicron processes  and the risk factors listed from time to time in xicor s sec reports  including but not limited to the factors affecting future results section following and part i  item of this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
xicor undertakes no obligation to publicly release or otherwise disclose the result of any revision to these forward looking statements that may be made as a result of events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
factors affecting future results the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also impair our business operations 
our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenue may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
you should not use our past financial performance to predict future operating results 
we have incurred net losses in three of the last four years 
our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  including the current severe business down cycle  competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  new product announcements and introductions of competing products by us or our competitors  market acceptance and subsequent design in of new products  unpredictability of changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the timing of significant orders including the fact that the sales level in any specific quarter depends significantly on orders received during that quarter  the gain or loss of significant customers  the availability  timely deliverability and cost of products manufactured on our behalf by third party suppliers  product obsolescence  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  difficulties in forecasting  planning and managing of inventory levels  and unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 

table of contents the exit from a portion of our memory business has changed our business model and is causing a reduction in our revenues 
in the first quarter of  xicor announced its plan to exit from offering stand alone low density serial eeprom memory products 
to date  xicor has been unable to secure a buyer for the business  particularly in light of the current weak economic conditions  and plans to complete its exit from that business in the transition out of the serial eeprom memory business has reduced xicor s revenues and is requiring the company to devote significant time and expense to transition activities at the same time it is increasing its focus on its mixed signal products 
if xicor s penetration of the mixed signal market does not increase  xicor s operating results could be seriously harmed and its stock price could decline 
further  as a result of the transition  xicor has become a smaller company with limited resources and a reduced workforce 
xicor may not be able to effectively use its limited resources to increase new product development and build its mixed signal product business 
this could cause a further decline in xicor s revenues 
the selling prices for our products are volatile and have historically declined over the life of a product 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry produces fluctuations in our operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns are generally characterized by diminished product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than one year 
we are presently experiencing an economic downturn that is harming our business 
our success depends on a better supply and demand balance within the industry and the various electronics industries that use semiconductors  including networking  communications and industrial companies  returning to more normal buying patterns 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
the composition of our major customer base changes as the market demand for our customers products change 
a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our sales 
a reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from a large customer could harm our business 
the loss of  or reduced orders by  any of our key customers could result in a significant decline in our sales 
we depend on distributors and manufacturers representatives to generate a majority of our sales 
distributors serve as a channel of sale to many end users of our products 
during  approximately of sales were through distribution  with one distributor accounting for of our sales 
our distributors and manufacturers representatives could discontinue selling our products at any time 
the loss of any significant distributor or manufacturers representative could seriously harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products 
our backlog may not result in future revenue  which would seriously harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
our future success depends in part on the continued services of our key design  engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain qualified personnel 
there is significant competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular for the highly skilled engineers involved in the design and development of our mixed signal products 
at times competition has been especially intense in silicon valley  where our design  research and development  and 
table of contents corporate headquarters are located 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our dependence on third party foundries to manufacture our products and on subcontractors to sort  assemble and test our products and ship our products to customers subjects us to a number of risks 
xicor out sources all manufacturing operations 
our reliance on third party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture our products and ship our products to customers involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new foundries and subcontractors  limited warranties by third party manufacturers on products supplied to us  and potential increases in product costs due to capacity shortages and other factors 
these risks may lead to a possible loss of sales  increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
additionally  as xicor shifts manufacturing of existing products between foundries and third party subcontractors  certain customers require requalification of such products prior to accepting delivery 
delays in customer qualification schedules or lack of qualification of such products could result in the loss of sales  which could seriously harm our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our sales do not meet our revenue projections 
revenue shortfalls can occur for any of the following reasons economic slowdowns in the markets we serve  significant pricing pressures that occur because of declines in selling prices over the life of a product  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  and sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication  sort  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations 
in addition  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside suppliers and foundries  we order materials and produce finished products in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering and production has and may continue to result in excess inventory levels or inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize or prices decrease substantially 

table of contents in we invested in a company whose stock is not publicly traded 
they recently completed a round of funding and are pursuing additional funding 
if they cannot obtain additional funding at a valuation that is at least equivalent to our investment valuation  this could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of our investment  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we have entered into certain minimum wafer purchase commitments with foundry partners in exchange for capacity commitments and plan our production based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
should demand for our products decrease  we may be required to make payments for unused capacity  which would cause our costs to increase 
because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of sales 
due to the length of the product design in cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after a customer first samples our product 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could adversely affect our ability to increase sales of our products 
we compete with major semiconductor companies such as analog devices  atmel corporation  catalyst semiconductor and maxim  most of whom have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do and have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor components 
in addition  our foundry partners have the right to develop and fabricate products based on our process technology 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their rapidly changing needs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products at competitive costs  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
furthermore  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our cost of sales may increase if we are required to purchase additional manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity in the future  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases and loans and enter into joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to secure this capacity and we may not be able to obtain such financing 

table of contents our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to do successfully 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and mask work production laws and rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
our operating results could be seriously harmed by the failure to be able to protect our intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
we recently filed suit against a competitor to protect our intellectual property 
litigation of this type can result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and can harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
if xicor or any of our foundries or third party subcontractors is accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties  we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose or settle claims  we could suffer a significant negative impact on our business and be forced to pay royalties and damages 
third parties have and may continue to assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay royalties and damages that could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
we have received notices claiming infringement of patents from several semiconductor manufacturers with respect to certain aspects of our processes and devices and these matters are under investigation and review 
although patent holders typically offer licenses and we have entered into such license agreements in the past  we may not be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms  and disputes may not be resolved without costly litigation 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
our international sales accounted for approximately of total sales in and of total sales in fiscal year our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  any of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  severe currency fluctuations and economic deflation  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
business interruptions could harm our business 
our operations and those of our foundries and other manufacturing subcontractors are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
our facility in the state of california may be subject to electrical blackouts due to a shortage of available electrical power 
if these blackouts were to occur  they could disrupt xicor s operations 
business interruption insurance may not provide protection due to the deductible periods or be enough to compensate us for losses that may occur 
additionally  xicor has been unable to obtain earthquake insurance of reasonable costs and limits 
we may face interruption of production and services due to increased security measures in response to recent and potential future terrorist activities 
our business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce 
recently  in response to terrorists activities and threats aimed at the united states  transportation  mail  financial and other services have been slowed or stopped altogether 
further delays or stoppages in 
table of contents transportation  mail  financial or other services  particularly any such delays or stoppages which harm our ability to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and products from our foreign foundries or contractors  could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for transportation  insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential activities 
we may also experience delays in receiving payments from customers that have been affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities 
the united states economy in general is being adversely affected by terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities 
any economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations  impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
moreover  we cannot determine whether other attacks may occur in the future and the effects of such attacks on our business could be severe 
our november debt financing substantially increased our indebtedness which may make it more difficult to obtain financing in the future and cause our business to suffer 
as a result of our november sale of notes and warrants  we incurred million of additional indebtedness 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
if any of these risks materialize we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan 
our business could be harmed if the net proceeds from the november debt financing is used ineffectively 
we have flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the debt financing 
we intend to use the proceeds of this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we may also use the proceeds for acquisitions  including acquisitions of intellectual property and design teams  if appropriate candidates can be identified and mutually acceptable terms can be agreed upon 
these purposes could also include funding research  development  sales and marketing and capital expenditures 
the failure to apply these net proceeds effectively could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt and exercise of warrants issued in connection with our convertible debt may result in dilution to holders of our common stock and a reduction in the price of our common stock 
in november we issued million in convertible notes and related warrants 
the convertible notes enable the holders to convert principal amounts owed under the notes into an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes we also issued warrants for the purchase of approximately one million shares of common stock that are exercisable at a price of per share 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the notes and exercise price of the warrants  holders of the notes and warrants may convert the debt and exercise the warrants 
xicor may force the conversion of all or a portion of the notes and warrants in certain circumstances 
our issuance of common stock at prices of per share upon conversion of the debt and per share upon exercise of the warrants may result in dilution to other holders of common stock and may cause the price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  if note and warrant holders elect to sell the common stock issued upon the conversion of the debt and exercise of the warrants  the price of our common stock may fall 
we may require additional capital in order to bring new products to market  and the issuance of new equity securities will dilute your investment in our common stock 
to implement our strategy of diversified product offerings  we need to bring new products to market 
bringing new products to market and ramping up production requires significant working capital 
we may also sell additional shares of our stock or seek additional borrowings or outside capital infusions 
we cannot assure 
table of contents you that such financing options will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  if we issue shares of our common stock  our shareholders will experience dilution with respect to their investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk xicor does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
xicor has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as held to maturity securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
xicor attempts to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of xicor s investment portfolio a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on xicor s operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
xicor is exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
xicor generally has not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and or result in operating losses
