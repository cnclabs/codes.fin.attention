a key component of that strategy is improving the corporation s bath tissue  paper towel and napkin business which is commonly referred to as the tissue business 
the corporation believes that its acquisition of fort james corporation in directly facilitated that strategy 
in  in connection with the corporation s redirection of its focus away from commodity based businesses  the corporation sold a portion of its pulp and paper assets to domtar inc and divested its timber and timberlands business by redeeming all of the outstanding shares of the timber company stock and merging its timber and timberlands business with plum creek 
as the corporation completed evaluations of its business portfolio last year  it became increasingly convinced that separating its consumer products and packaging business and its building products business has the potential to create shareholder value 
in the summer of  management began working on a plan to create separate vehicles for those businesses 
management believes there are a number of potential benefits from separating the businesses 
among them  it is believed a separation would create both a high value added consumer products and packaging company with strong brands and stable cashflow and one of the strongest domestic pure play building products companies  drive sharpened management focus and provide better performance incentives  eliminate cross subsidies  with each business free to use it cash flow to reinvest or distribute to shareholders as appropriate  and allow each business to develop its own appropriate strategies and capital structures 
other the corporation employs approximately  people  approximately  of whom are members of unions 
the corporation considers its relationship with its employees to be good 
fifty five union contracts are subject to negotiation and renewal in  including seven at large facilities 
on january   eleven of the fifteen members of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies the legacy currencies and a single new currency the euro 
for a three year transition period  transactions can be conducted in both the euro and the legacy currencies but all corporate transactions and records must legally be maintained in euros effective january  the adoption of the euro will affect a multitude of financial systems and business applications 
the corporation has operations in seven of the participating countries  which adopted the euro effective january  and has product sales in ten of the participating countries 
the corporation s european businesses affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the information system issues and the potential business implications of converting to a common currency 
as of december   the 
table of contents corporation s core financial information technology systems were capable of processing euro denominated transactions 
the impact of converting to the euro was immaterial to the corporation 
the corporation and many other companies are defendants in suits brought in various courts around the nation by plaintiffs who allege that they have suffered personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products 
these suits allege a variety of lung and other diseases based on alleged exposure to products previously manufactured by the corporation 
in many cases  the plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that any injuries they have incurred in fact resulted from exposure to the corporation s products 
the corporation s asbestos liabilities relate primarily to joint systems products manufactured by bestwall gypsum company that contained asbestos fiber 
the corporation acquired bestwall in  and discontinued using asbestos in the manufacture of these products in the following table presents information about the approximate number of the corporation s asbestos claims during the past three years and the most recent quarterly period quarter ended year ended december  december  december  january  claims filed claims resolved claims unresolved at end of period claims filed includes all asbestos claims for which service has been received and or a file has been opened by the corporation 
claims resolved includes asbestos claims which have been settled or dismissed or which are in the process of being settled or dismissed based upon agreements or understandings in place with counsel for the claimants 
in addition  fort james corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  currently is defending approximately  asbestos premises liability claims 
as of december   the corporation had either settled  had dismissed or was in the process of finalizing the settlement of a total of approximately  asbestos claims 
the corporation generally settles asbestos claims for amounts it considers reasonable given the facts and circumstances of each claim 
substantially all of the amounts it has paid to date for settled claims  and anticipates paying for pending claims  have been covered by product liability insurance 
the amounts not covered by such insurance have been immaterial 
the annual average settlement payment per asbestos claimant has fluctuated up and down during the three year period ended december   and management of the corporation expects such fluctuations to continue in the future based upon  among other things  the number and type of claims settled in a particular period and the jurisdictions in which such claims arose 
in the late fall of  the corporation retained national economic research associates nera and peterson consulting  nationally recognized consultants in asbestos liability and insurance  to work with the corporation to project the amount  net of insurance  that the corporation would pay for its asbestos related liabilities and defense costs through the methodology employed by nera to project the corporation s asbestos related liabilities and defense costs included an analysis of the population likely to have been exposed or claim exposure to products manufactured by the corporation  the use of epidemiological studies to estimate the number of people who might allege exposure to the corporation s products that would be likely to develop asbestos related diseases in each year between and  an analysis of the corporation s recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases for the period through  an analysis of the corporation s currently pending asbestos claims  and an analysis of the corporation s historical asbestos settlements and defense costs to develop average settlement values and defense costs  which varied by disease type and the nature of claim  to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims 
table of contents through based upon its analysis  nera projected that the corporation s total  undiscounted asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  over the next years will be less than billion including payments related to the approximately  claims currently pending 
nera s projection was based on historical data supplied by the corporation and publicly available studies 
nera concluded that  based on the latency periods of asbestos related diseases both cancers and non cancers  the peak incidence of such diseases occurred prior to it expects  based on the last dates of manufacture of asbestos containing products in the united states  that the number of new diagnoses of asbestosis and other non cancerous diseases will drop beginning in it also cites annual surveys of the national cancer institutes that show the annual incidence of mesothelioma a cancer frequently associated with asbestos exposure began to decline in the mid s 
nera expects these factors  as well as the advancing age of the allegedly exposed population  its movement away from work centers as its members retire  and nera s view that many asbestos claims filed in the s were based in part on mass screenings of possibly exposed individuals  will result in the number of claims filed against the corporation for asbestos related injuries beginning to decline in using nera s projection  peterson consulting and the corporation then conducted an analysis to determine the amount of insurance that it is probable that the corporation will recover during this ten year period 
in conducting such analysis  peterson consulting and the corporation reviewed the corporation s existing insurance arrangements and agreements  engaged in discussions with counsel to the corporation  analyzed publicly available information bearing on the credit worthiness of the corporation s various insurers and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as the corporation and peterson consulting believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities through the analysis took into account self insurance reserves  policy exclusions  liability caps and gaps in the corporation s coverage  as well as insolvencies among certain of the corporation s insurance carriers 
based on the analysis of nera and peterson consulting  the corporation has established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable liabilities and defense costs it believes it will pay through  and has also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that are deemed probable 
the corporation has recorded the reserves for the asbestos liabilities as other current liabilities and other long term liabilities and the related insurance recoveries as other current assets and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for the fourth quarter  the corporation recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of million to cover all of the projected asbestos liabilities and defense costs  net of expected insurance recoveries  it expects to pay through this charge principally covers the share of such costs which the corporation expects to incur because of the insolvencies of certain insurance companies which wrote a part of the corporation s product liability insurance in prior years 
the charge is not due to exhaustion of the corporation s total product liability insurance for asbestos liabilities  and the corporation believes that the majority of its asbestos related liabilities and defense costs during the next ten years will be recovered from its insurance carriers 
the insurance receivable recorded by the corporation does not assume any recovery from insolvent carriers  and assumes that those carriers which are currently solvent will continue to be solvent throughout the period of nera s projection 
however  there can be no assurances that these assumptions will be correct 
substantially all of the insurance recoveries deemed probable are from insurance companies rated a excellent or better by am best company 
no more than of such insurance recoveries are from any one company  though several of the insurers are under common control 
the corporation also has significant additional insurance coverage which it expects to be available for asbestos liabilities and defense costs it may incur after the analyses of nera and peterson consulting are based on their best judgment and that of the corporation 
however  projecting future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of resolving each such claim  coverage issues among layers of insurers and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies is subject to many uncertainties which could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected and or recorded 
consequently  there can be no assurance these projected liabilities will be accurate  or that the probable insurance recoveries will be realized 
in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long term projections  the corporation has determined that the ten year period through is the most reasonable time period for projecting asbestos liabilities and defense 
table of contents costs and probable insurance recoveries and  accordingly  the charge to earnings does not include either asbestos liabilities or insurance recoveries for any period past given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside the control of the corporation  the corporation believes that it is possible that it may incur asbestos liabilities for the period through and beyond in an amount in excess of the nera projection 
based on currently available data and upon the analysis of nera and peterson consulting  the corporation does not believe that any such possible asbestos liabilities in excess of the nera projection are reasonably likely to be material to the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the corporation 
critical accounting policies a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the corporation to provide readers of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the corporation s operating results and financial condition 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the corporation s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important when determining amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets in a business combination and in developing the corporation s projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with environmental and legal matters 
the corporation recognizes a liability for environmental remediation and legal indemnification and defense costs when it believes it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the liabilities are developed based on currently available information and reflect the participation of other potentially responsible parties  depending on the parties financial condition and probable contribution 
the accruals are recorded at undiscounted amounts and are reflected as liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation also has insurance that covers losses on certain environmental claims and records a receivable to the extent that the realization of the insurance is deemed probable 
this receivable is recorded at undiscounted amounts and is reflected as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  management uses judgment in assessing goodwill  and other long lived assets for impairment 
the corporation amortizes costs in excess of fair value of net assets of businesses acquired using the straight line method over a period not to exceed years 
the corporation reviews the recorded value of its goodwill annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability is then determined by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows of the assets to which the goodwill applies to the net book value  including goodwill  of those assets 
goodwill  net of amortization  totaled billion at december  and represented of total assets 
the corporation assesses its long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
to analyze recoverablility  the corporation projects undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment would be recognized  resulting in a write down of assets with a corresponding charge to earnings 
the impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets

factors that may affect future results some of the matters discussed in this form k and the accompanying annual review concerning  among other things  the business outlook  anticipated financial and operating results  strategies  contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation  constitute forward looking statements and are based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events 
there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation s results will be as estimated 
in some cases  the forward looking statements contained in this form k and the accompanying annual review can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  or estimates  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements are only predictions 
therefore  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on information known today and speak only as of the date of the filing of this form k 
moreover  in the future  the corporation  through its senior management team  may make additional or different forward looking statements about the matters described in this document 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any of these forward looking statements to reflect changes in the facts or information on which they are based or any events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof 
actual events or future results may differ materially as a result of the following factors  as well as other factors described elsewhere in this form k  or in the corporation s other sec filings  including the corporation s form k  dated october   and form k  dated january   which are incorporated herein by this reference 
the following factors  which the corporation cautions are not exclusive  are described in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  which encourages companies to disclose these factors 
the corporation has substantial indebtedness 
as described in this form k and the accompanying annual review  the corporation has substantial indebtedness 
the corporation s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to repay its outstanding indebtedness will depend in part on cash from operations and in part on cash produced by divestitures of some of the corporation s businesses 
there can be no assurance that such divestitures will be consummated  or  if 
table of contents consummated  that the price and terms of such divestitures will be advantageous to the corporation 
further  there can be no assurance that the corporation s businesses will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  as they are subject to general economic  business  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond the corporation s control 
the corporation s level of indebtedness has important consequences  including limiting the corporation s ability to invest operating cash flow to expand its business  to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures or adverse changes in governmental regulation  because it must dedicate a substantial portion of these cash flows to service its debt 
in addition  the corporation could  under certain circumstances that management believes are unlikely to occur  be unable to refinance or obtain additional financing because of market conditions  its high levels of debt and the debt restrictions under its current debt agreements 
in early january  moody s investors service announced that it was placing under review for possible downgrade  from investment grade to non investment grade  the corporation s senior unsecured notes which moody s currently rates as baa and commercial paper carrying a prime short term rating 
although no such downgrade has occurred and other credit rating services have not followed moody s position  there can be no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
management does not believe such a downgrade would adversely affect its access to the debt markets or its financing costs 
however  changes in market conditions could mean that such a downgrade  if it were to occur  could result in the corporation experiencing difficulties in borrowing on terms as favorable as it was able to achieve previously 
execution of transformation strategy 
the corporation s long term strategy is to improve its portfolio of businesses by divesting or exiting non strategic businesses  and by acquiring and expanding businesses which are high value added and that position georgia pacific closer to its customers 
a key to this transformation will be the corporation s tissue business  which was expanded significantly with the acquisition of fort james corporation in late although the corporation believes that it has a strong cost position  superior manufacturing expertise and excellent brands  this business faces competition from established companies that may have more experience or expertise in marketing  advertising and brand management than the corporation currently has 
to succeed  the corporation must continue to develop brand recognition and loyalty  product quality and performance  price  marketing and distribution capabilities 
aggressive reaction by competitors may lead to increased advertising and promotional spending by the corporation in order to maintain market share in this segment as well as others 
in addition  to successfully achieve its strategy the corporation will need to rely heavily on the development and introduction of new products and product line extensions as a means of achieving and or maintaining leadership in various product categories 
competition and volatility of commodity businesses 
the corporation faces intense competition from both large international and small domestic producers in most of its businesses 
however  operating results are particularly volatile for the corporation s building products and pulp and paper businesses because most of these products are commodities  for which price is the principal competitive factor 
the corporation cannot control such factors as decreasing demand from customers or increasing supply from competitors  both of which cause price decreases for such products which adversely affects the corporation s net sales  operating income and cash flows 
costs associated with environmental compliance and remediation and litigation 
as more fully discussed under note of the corporation s consolidated financial statements which are presented under item of this form k  the corporation s operations are subject to significant regulation by federal  state and local environmental and safety authorities 
the costs of compliance with existing and new regulatory schemes could require significant capital expenditures that would decrease the amount of funds 
table of contents available for investment in other areas of the corporation s operations 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency has recently issued new air emission regulations  known as mact or maximum achievable control technology regulations 
the costs of compliance with these regulations and additional or supplementary regulations cannot be definitively quantified and there can be no assurance that the costs of such compliance will not be material to the corporation s results of operations in certain reporting periods 
in addition  the costs of remediating known environmental sites  as described in note of the corporation s consolidated financial statements  in some instances has been significant and remediation of future sites could also be significant 
there can be no assurance that the final remediation costs will equal currently estimated costs or that additional sites will not require significant remediation expenses 
the corporation is subject to litigation risks that are similar to other corporations of its size and complexity in an increasingly litigious environment 
while the corporation does not believe that any of these matters will be material to its long term financial status  as disclosed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other and note of the corporation s consolidated financial statements  certain litigation related matters may be material to the corporation s results of operations in certain reporting periods
