overview hollywood media is a provider of entertainment related information  content and ticketing services to consumers and businesses 
we manage a number of integrated business units focused on hollywood  broadway and the entertainment industry 
hollywood media has a diverse revenue stream from this array of business units  including revenue from retail and wholesale broadway ticket sales  business to business content syndication  subscription fees  content licensing fees  advertising and book development 
due to a common focus on entertainment each of these business units supports the others  ie sharing content 
we were incorporated in and our business initially consisted of the development  licensing and publishing of intellectual properties  and the operation of entertainment related retail stores 
during we ceased the publishing part of our intellectual property business we continue to develop and license intellectual property and during and we phased out all of our retail stores in order to concentrate our resources on the development of a movie vertical focused on providing movie data to businesses and operating consumer sites 
we expanded our organization further in by adding a ticketing vertical providing broadway ticketing services to businesses and consumers 
a vertical is multiple units which have complimentary operations in the same general type of business 
we also continue to own an intellectual property business including tekno books in which we own and consolidate into our results of operations and netco partners in which we own and account for under the equity method of accounting 
since  we have significantly expanded our business through acquisitions of other entertainment related businesses and the development of strategic relationships with major media companies

these changes to our business have affected our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we generated revenues from our intellectual properties business and our entertainment retail operations 
following the closure of our retail stores by the end of and expansion of our business through acquisitions  we currently rely on our business to business syndication operations  broadway and movie ticketing operations and advertising sales along with our existing intellectual properties business to generate revenues for the foreseeable future 
the growth of our syndication  ticketing and internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and we expect to continue to require additional financing to fund our growth plan and for working capital 
our operating plans and assumptions indicate that anticipated cash flows when combined with other potential sources of capital  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the year in the event that we require additional funding and cannot secure additional funding  hollywood media s chairman of the board and chief executive officer and hollywood media s vice chairman and president  have indicated their intention to provide hollywood media  if required  with an amount not to exceed million 
the commitment will be reduced dollar for dollar as other financing is obtained  provided that such additional financing is not used to finance acquisitions 
the commitment terminates on january  if plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to seek further financing or curtail our operations 
our long term financial success depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations

hollywood media has entered into less barter transactions in fiscal as compared to fiscal in order to maximize its cash advertising revenue 
the decrease of  of advertising sales for fiscal is the result of the softening of the online advertising market as a whole which has caused our normal levels of cpm cost per thousand charged to be reduced in fiscal as compared to fiscal online and traditional advertising was soft in and we were not excluded from the effects 
we saw an improvement in ad sales revenues in the latter part of fourth quarter which was due in part to an increasing trend in our internet traffic to our web sites

we have taken several steps to substantially reduce our cash losses by consolidating resources  the closure of unprofitable divisions  and increased controls on expenses 
the benefits can be seen in our results for and we expect to see these savings continue into in mid  we began a two step approach to consolidate the hollywood 
com web site technology and production into our corporate office in south florida which was completed in january we eliminated duplication of resources  which together with tightened control over expenses  resulted in a total annual savings of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  hollywood media  as part of its operational evaluation process  determined that profitability in the e commerce business could not be reached due to tight margins and high fulfillment costs 
this business  which incurred losses of approximately million in  was closed in january a similar evaluation of our international web site  hollywood 
com international resulted in closure of this business in october  resulting in savings of over  on an annualized basis 
during  we continued with our efforts to reduce costs by further consolidation of activities and services  such as co locations of web servers  consolidating connectivity  t lines and employee resources

ticketing has become the most significant revenue source for hollywood media  most notably through the acquisition of theater direct international in september  the launch of broadway 
com in may and broadway in november expansion of our business to business and internet ad sales is equally as important since we have stabilized the costs to run these operations and we believe the high gross margins generated from these business units will improve overall cash flow

hollywood media is currently exploring additional financing alternatives  including a bank line of credit  for hollywood media although there can be no assurance that such financing alternatives will be available to hollywood media or can be obtained in terms favorable to hollywood media 
in the event that hollywood media requires additional funding and cannot secure additional funding  hollywood media s chairman of the board and chief executive officer and hollywood media s vice chairman and president  have indicated their intention to provide hollywood media  if required  with an amount not to exceed million in order to enable hollywood media to meet its working capital requirements during  provided  however  that the commitment will be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent that hollywood media raises financing from other sources and such additional financing is not used to finance acquisitions

as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following ticketing revenue recognition ticket revenue is derived from the sale of live theater tickets for broadway  off broadway and london shows to individuals  groups  travel agencies  tour groups and educational facilities 
revenue recognition is deferred on ticket sales until performance has taken place 
ticket revenue and cost of revenue are recorded on a gross basis 
hollywood media changed its method of revenue recognition effective january   from recognition of revenue from ticket sales when collection was assured and delivery to the customer had taken place to the date of performance for all ticket sales 
the impact of this change on the financial statements for the period prior to january  was not material 
the impact on reported results of operations for would have been a reduction of recognized net revenues of approximately  or and an increase in reported net loss of  or 
advertising costs hollywood media expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or when such advertising initially takes place 
as further described in note  in the first quarter of  hollywood media issued common stock and warrants to cbs with a fair value of approximately million in exchange for approximately million of advertising on cbs properties to be received over a period of seven years 
hollywood media is entitled to utilize a specified portion of this advertising each contract year

impairment of long lived assets hollywood media applies the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under the provisions of this statement  hollywood media has evaluated its long lived assets for financial impairment  and will continue to evaluate them as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
hollywood media evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
hollywood media determines fair value as the net present value of future cash flows 
based on these evaluations  there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in  or in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  were no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to june  will cease to be amortized beginning january  in addition  sfas will change the way we evaluate goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles will no longer be amortized  however  they will be subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test 
the fair value based test is a two step test 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we will be required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to the assets including unrecognized intangibles and liabilities of the reporting unit  with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss will be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value 
the initial impairment test will be performed as of january  however  the transition provisions of sfas allow until june  to complete step one of the test and  if required  until december  to complete step effective january   we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
our annual goodwill amortization is approximately million 
we believe the provisions of sfas did not materially impact the results of operations 
inflation and seasonality although hollywood media cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation  it does not believe inflation has a material effect on sales or results of operations 
hollywood media considers its business to be somewhat seasonal and expects net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for its tekno books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
the ticketing business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the tony awards c and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holidays 
in addition  although not seasonal  hollywood media s intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis
