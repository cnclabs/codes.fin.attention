item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is to inform you about our financial position  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  and the results of operations for the years ended december   and general during  our economy slipped into a recession due to weakened demand for products creating surplus inventories in a majority of business sectors 
the energy sector  which was not an exception  experienced a significant decline in demand and consequently inventory levels for both natural gas and crude oil materially increased over the previous year s inventory levels 
with the significant build up of inventory by mid  commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil decreased approximately and  respectively  from the beginning of the year 
demand for drilling has significantly decreased during the last half of with a decrease in exploration activity 
liquidity and capital resources a company s liquidity is the amount of time expected to elapse until an asset can be converted to cash or conversely until a liability has to be paid 
liquidity is one indication of a company s ability to meet its obligations or commitment 
historically  our major sources of liquidity have come from internally generated cash flow from operations  funds generated from the exercise of warrants options and proceeds from public and private stock offerings 
the following table represents the sources and uses of cash for the years indicated 
for the years ended december  beginning cash balance    sources of cash cash provided by used in operations    cash provided by financing activities    cash provided by sales of oil gas properties and equipment   cash provided from acquisition  total sources of cash including cash on    hand uses of cash oil and gas expenditures    other assets including advance to industry partners    total uses of cash    ending cash balance    our working capital was a deficit of  at december  compared to surpluses of  at december  and  at december  the significant decrease to our working capital was due to higher capital expenditures associated with our intensified drilling and lease acquisition activity principally occurring in the last half of our capital program was funded from cash flow from operations  funds received from our preferred stock private placement  and proceeds from the sale of certain evaluated and unevaluated oil and gas properties 
approximately million was expended during the year on our exploration and development program  including the acquisition of additional working interests in production and leasehold acreage  both evaluated and unevaluated 
approximately million was expended in the fourth quarter on additional lease acquisition in our west broussard area and the drilling of the signal hill big twelve wilcox test well  the ponson raceland s sand test well  the elk hills texana wilcox test well  the rubel sara white test well  and test or development wells in the brookshire dome area 
for the year our results from our exploration program have been disappointing in regards to the discovery of any significant field or extensions 
however  we have increased proved reserves for by bcfe or  which was primarily the result of the completion of leasing and the unitization of our west broussard prospect which added approximately bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves 
our proved developed reserves declined by bcfe or 
our proved developed discoveries were offset by the current year s production and downward revision of reserves 
this was due to lower commodity prices  higher operating expenses associated with our wehlu production and downward volume revision due to lack of production history  related to the brookshire dome area 
our liquidity has been significantly reduced during the year by our aggressive drilling and exploration program and a significant decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices 
our principal source of short term liquidity is from operating cash flow 
should natural gas and crude oil prices decrease further  our current operating cash flow would decrease and further reduce our liquidity 
our short term liquidity and working capital should increase in the first quarter of due to a significant decrease in capital expenditures as our late drilling projects near completion and lower overall drilling activity 
an additional source of short term liquidity will be funds received from the reduction of our interests in certain unevaluated or proved undeveloped projects 
to date  subsequent to december   we have received approximately  from the sale of interests in our west broussard  lake boeuf and north mexican sweetheart prospects 
we intend to further reduce our working interest in these and other unevaluated projects to enhance our risk profile and raise additional working capital for our capital program and debt reduction 
in  with the decline of commodity prices and a reduction in our proved developed reserves  our borrowing base capacity under the current credit facility  which was acquired through the red river energy acquisition  has not increased and is not a material source of capital 
however  historically we have not used credit facilities for a source of funds in our drilling or leasing activity 
should proved developed reserves not materially increase and or pricing further decline  our borrowing base may be reduced below the amount currently borrowed and outstanding under this facility 
if this event occurs we would be obligated to pay down the outstanding amount to the re determined borrowing capacity 
we would rely on cash flow from operations and funds generated from the sale of unevaluated or proved undeveloped prospects to make this pay down 
the next re determination will take place in april long term liquidity and capital resources we have no material long term commitments associated with our capital expenditure plans or operating agreements 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on the success we have with our exploratory drilling activities in future periods  gas and oil price conditions and other related economic factors 
the following tables show our contractual obligations and commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years after years year long term debt    operating leases    total cash obligations     is related to our current credit agreement with a commercial bank
