history of operations onyx was founded in february we commercially released version of our flagship product  onyx customer center  in december in our first three years of operation  we focused primarily on research and development activities  recruiting personnel  purchasing operating assets  marketing our products  building a direct sales force and expanding our service business 
our revenues totaled million in and million in in mid  we substantially expanded our operations to capitalize on our opportunity within the rapidly emerging crm market 
we decided  at the potential expense of profitability  to accelerate our investments in research and development  marketing  domestic and international sales channels  professional services and our general and administrative infrastructure 
we believe these investments have been critical to our growth 
our revenues grew to million in  million in and million in nevertheless  these investments have also significantly increased our operating expenses  contributing to the net losses that we incurred in each fiscal quarter from the first quarter of through the second quarter of after achieving profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  we decided to again accelerate our investments in research and development  marketing  domestic and international sales channels  professional services and our general and administrative infrastructure to further capitalize on our opportunity within the crm market 
in  our revenues grew to million and we incurred a net loss totaling million 
in  we had revenues of million and incurred a net loss of million  including restructuring and impairment charges totaling million 
we implemented a restructuring plan during to bring our staffing and structure in line with our revenue base 

table of contents it is particularly difficult to predict the timing or amount of our license revenues  which have comprised the majority of our total revenues  because our sales cycles are lengthy and variable  typically ranging between three and twelve months from our initial contact with a potential customer to the signing of a license agreement  although the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and occasionally sales require substantially more time  a substantial portion of our sales are completed at the end of the quarter and  as a result  a substantial portion of our license revenues are recognized in the last month of a quarter  and often in the last weeks or days of a quarter  the amount of unfulfilled orders for our products at the beginning of a quarter is small because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received  and delay of new product releases can result in a customer s decision to delay execution of a contract or  for contracts that include the new release as an element of the contract  will result in deferral of revenue recognition until such release 
even though our revenues are difficult to predict  we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
many of our expenses are relatively fixed  and we cannot quickly reduce spending if our revenues are lower than expected 
during  we saw a shift in the buying behavior of our targeted new and existing customer base as a result of economic conditions leading to a delay of our customers capital spending initiatives  which we believe was the primary reason we experienced a significant license revenue shortfall relative to our original operating plan 
in addition  our revenues for the third and fourth quarters of were adversely affected by the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  which led to further delays in capital spending initiatives of our prospects and installed base 
in this economic environment  we continue to believe it will be difficult to predict our license revenue as capital spending initiatives of our targeted new and existing customer base are delayed 
due to the uncertainty of near term sales growth  we determined that onyx s infrastructure  which had resulted in revenue growth in the prior year  was no longer sustainable 
in april  we began our restructuring efforts to reduce headcount  reduce infrastructure and eliminate excess and duplicate facilities to re align our organization toward profitable growth 
further reductions were enacted in the third and fourth quarters of we continue to align costs and expenses to our expected revenues and review our restructuring efforts 
in the near term  we believe our costs and operating expenses  excluding restructuring related charges  will continue to decrease to a level that is closer to our expected revenues while allowing us to continue to invest in accordance with our strategic priorities 
however  we may be unable to achieve these expense reductions without adversely affecting our business and operating results 
we may continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  even if sales of our products and services continue to grow 
critical accounting policies and estimates onyx s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software companies including statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  sop  and related interpretations including technical practice aids 
onyx generates revenues through two sources a software license revenues and b service revenues 
software license revenues are generated from licensing the rights to use our products directly to end users and vsps and indirectly through vars and  to a lesser extent  through third party products we distribute 
service revenues are generated from sales of customer support services maintenance contracts  consulting services and training services performed for customers that license our products 
license revenues are recognized when a noncancellable license agreement is in force as evidenced by a signed contract  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  or consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
standard terms for license agreements call for payment within days 
probability of collection is based upon the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of their current financial statements or credit reports 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
revenues from distribution agreements with vars are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of cash from the var or identification of an end user 
in the latter case  probability of collection is evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of the var 
our agreements with customers  vsps and vars do not contain product return rights 
revenues from customer support services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis or  in certain situations  on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
implementation services are periodically performed under fixed fee arrangements and in such cases  consulting revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as services are performed 
standard terms for renewal of customer support contracts  consulting services and training services call for payment within days 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of the services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 

table of contents if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
bad debts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we have recorded significant changes in our bad debt reserves in recent periods due to the rapid downturn in the economy  and in the technology sector in particular  and we may record additional changes in the future 
restructuring 
during  we recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring program 
these accruals include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities and other contracts 
although we do not currently anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates  particularly the costs surrounding the excess leased facilities 
if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees  if rental rates continue to decrease in the markets we are located  or if it takes us longer than expected to find a suitable sublease tenant  the actual costs could exceed our estimates 
impairment of intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
beginning in  the methodology for assessing potential impairments of intangibles will change based on new accounting rules issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  and related practice implementation guidance 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to class action lawsuits and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
investment losses and impairment during and  we invested in a small number of private companies 
one of these investments was accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to our ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee and losses were recorded to the extent of our investment 
the remaining private equity investments are accounted for on a cost basis due to the fact that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee and our ownership interest is less than 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
this evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors by members of senior management  including a review of the investee s financial condition  results of operations  operating trends and other financial ratios 
we further consider the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  as well as market prices of comparable public companies 
we generally require our private investees to deliver monthly  quarterly and annual financial statements to assist in reviewing relevant financial data and to assist in determining whether such data may indicate other than temporary declines in fair value below our accounting basis 
we generally consider a decline to be an other than temporary impairment if the estimated value is less than our accounting basis for two consecutive quarters  absent evidence to the contrary

results of operations we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including general economic conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment levels in management information systems  rate of market acceptance of our crm solution  budget and spending decisions by our customers  customers decisions to defer orders or implementations  particularly large orders or implementations  from one quarter to the next  or to proceed with smaller than forecasted orders or implementations  level of purchases by our existing customers  including additional license and maintenance revenues  our ability to enable our products to operate on multiple platforms

no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these periods 
license fee revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and decreased to million in  a decrease of 
the increase in license fee revenues from to reflected the increased market acceptance of our existing products  continued enhancement of these products and increased breadth of our product offerings 
the increase also was attributable to increased follow on sales to existing customers  sales of our products to new industry segments  increased sales as a result of the expansion of our direct and indirect channels of distribution and our marketing organization and overall growth in the crm market during this period 
we believe the decrease in license revenues from to was primarily due to a shift in the buying behavior of our targeted new and existing customer base as a result of economic conditions as well as the september  terrorist attacks on the united states and subsequent hostilities 
both factors led to a delay of our prospective and existing customers capital spending initiatives

of the increase from to  million was due to increased consulting and training services and million was due to increased maintenance and support revenues 
service revenues represented of our total revenues in  in and in we expect our support and service revenues to decrease in absolute dollars in primarily because of our strategic decision to provide more opportunities for our partners to engage with our customers  and due to the reduction in demand for our consulting services resulting from the decrease in our license revenues in recent quarters 
in addition  we may experience a decline in maintenance revenues as customers elect not to renew annual maintenance contracts  primarily due to specific economic circumstances facing each of our customers and fewer new licenses sold in we expect the proportion of support and service revenues to total revenues to fluctuate in the future  depending in part on our customers direct use of third party consulting and implementation service providers  the degree to which we provide opportunities for our partners to engage with our customers and the ongoing renewals of customer support contracts  as well as our overall sales of software licenses to new and existing customers 
revenues outside of north america increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in the increase in revenues outside of north america from to resulted from our investments in direct and indirect sales channels  primarily in europe  japan  australia  singapore and latin america  including the acquisitions of market solutions in the united kingdom and csn computer consulting in germany 
the decrease in revenues outside of north america from to resulted from lower license revenues in these regions 
revenues from indirect sales channels increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in the increase in our indirect revenues from to primarily resulted from the increased number of vars we added domestically and internationally over the period 
we believe the decrease in license revenues from to  both outside of north america and from indirect channels  was primarily due to a shift in the buying behavior of our targeted new and existing customer base as a result of economic conditions  leading to a delay of their capital spending initiatives

cost of support and service revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of  and to million in  an increase of 
the increases in dollar amount resulted primarily from hiring and training consulting  customer support and training personnel to support our growing customer base 
although our professional services headcount had declined at the end of compared to the end of the prior year as a result of our restructuring efforts  the average number of service personnel over the course of was higher than in the increase in was also the result of an increase in the use of third party service providers  which have a higher cost structure than our internal resources 
cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related support and service revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of service revenues as a percentage of related service revenues from to primarily reflects a higher proportion of service revenues from consulting and training services  which have a higher direct cost structure and therefore contribute lower margins than our customer support services  coupled with a higher percentage use of third party service providers in our consulting engagements  which contribute significantly lower margins than internal resources 
the cost of services as a percentage of service revenues may vary between periods primarily for two reasons the mix of services we provide consulting  customer support  training  which have different direct cost structures  and the resources we use to deliver these services internal versus third parties

the increase in dollar amount from to is also 
table of contents due to increases in sales commissions and bonuses associated with increased revenues and increases in marketing activities  including advertising  trade shows  cyber seminars and direct mail campaigns

sales and marketing expenses represented of our total revenues in  in and in the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects the more rapid growth of sales and marketing expenses in each period compared to the growth of revenues  particularly in where we experienced an unexpected shortfall in license revenues

we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in relative to as we gain the full benefit of our restructuring efforts and invest in resource levels that more closely align with the expected demand of our products

table of contents in  we added key executive personnel we believe to be critical to our near term and long term growth strategies 
the expenses related to adding these personnel will offset  in large part  our reduction in other general and administrative expense areas enacted as part of our restructuring plan 
as we gain visibility into our long term sales growth opportunity  we believe our general and administrative expenses may increase as we expand our administrative staff  domestically and internationally  and incur additional professional services fees 
restructuring and other related charges restructuring and other related charges of million in represent our efforts to reduce our overall cost structure 
employee separation costs  which include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other benefits  totaled million during  relating to the termination of more than employees 
all functional areas were affected by the reductions 
excess facilities charges in were estimated at million 
these costs are the result of our decision to reduce or exit certain domestic and international facilities 
the estimated facilities costs are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets or estimated termination fees 
the market for office space is currently weak 
we have had preliminary discussions with the landlord of the excess bellevue  washington facilities regarding a potential termination of the lease associated with these facilities 
if we are able to negotiate a termination of these facilities  we may incur significant costs associated with the termination  some of which may be paid in the form of our equity securities 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating affordable termination fees on certain facilities  if facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets  if it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  or if other estimates and assumptions change  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
we will continue to revise our restructuring charges as more definitive information becomes available 
future cash outlays are anticipated through at least september unless estimates and assumptions change or we are able to negotiate our exit of these leases at an earlier date 
assets disposed of or removed from operations consisted primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment  office equipment  furniture and fixtures 
the estimated cost for fixed asset impairments was million 
other restructuring related costs  including cancellation fees for certain sales and marketing activities  professional fees and the write down of other assets  totaled million 
for the year ended december   restructuring charges were million  of which million related to asset impairments and other non cash charges and million has been paid out in cash

the components of the charges recorded for the year ended december   are as follows charge for the year ended cash balance at december  payments december  and write offs in thousands excess facilities employee separation costs asset impairments other total we are continuing to align our operations and review our restructuring efforts 
in the near term  we believe our costs and operating expenses  excluding restructuring related charges  will decrease modestly 
expenses will increase when and if revenues increase 
however  we may be unable to achieve these expense reductions without adversely affecting our business and operating results 
we may continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  even if sales of our products and services continue to grow

we had no outstanding borrowings under the working capital facility  however  there was approximately million in standby letters of credit outstanding in connection with the leases of equipment and our facilities  of which million represents a security deposit for rent associated with additional facilities in bellevue  washington 
if our borrowing base falls below outstanding standby letters of credit issued by svb on our behalf  svb may require us to cash secure the amount by which our standby letters of credit exceed the borrowing base 
on january   we pledged million in cash to secure the amount by which our standby letters of credit exceeded the borrowing base 
on february   we entered into a new loan and security agreement with svb  which replaces our then existing credit facility with them 
the facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of a of our eligible accounts receivable based on a borrowing base calculation  or b million  and bears interest at svb s prime rate plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
the credit facility is secured by our accounts receivable  property and equipment and intellectual property 
additionally  we must maintain at least million in unrestricted deposit accounts with svb 
the loan and security agreement with svb requires us to maintain certain financial covenants based on a monthly tangible net worth calculation 
also  similar to the prior credit facility  to the extent the borrowing base falls below outstanding letters of credit  svb may require us to cash secure the excess 
the facility expires on december  based on the outstanding standby letters of credit  no additional amounts are currently available under the new credit facility

our near term restructuring costs and excess facilities  along with our ongoing operations  may consume a material amount of our cash resources 
it is also possible that we will use a portion of our cash resources to acquire complementary technologies or businesses  however  we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to any transactions of this nature 
in february  we completed a firm underwritten offering of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price to the public of per share from our million shelf registration  including  shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option granted to wells fargo securities  llc  the sole underwriter for the offering 
we estimate the net proceeds to be million after deducting the estimated costs associated with the offering 
we intend to use the net proceeds for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes  as well as the possible acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products and technologies 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to pay obligations arising in connection with the potential termination of the lease of our excess facilities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may seek additional funds before that time through public or private equity financing or from other sources to fund our operations and pursue our growth strategy 
we have no commitment for additional financing  and we may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in onyx 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
we will apply sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
is expected to result in an increase in operating results of  per quarter in we will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of million along with a deferred tax liability of  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
this will result in approximately million of goodwill and million of other 
table of contents intangibles commencing on january  we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step approach prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our earnings and financial position 
the fasb also recently issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles bulletin opinion  reporting the results of operations 
sfas no 
provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
sfas no 
also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date  as presently required 
we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
to have a significant effect on our financial position or operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
interest rate risk we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  which is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december  foreign currency risk in  international revenues accounted for of consolidated revenues compared to in international revenues  as well as most of the related expenses incurred  are denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding country 
results of operations from our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars upon consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  revenues and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material to onyx during the years ended december   or at december   we were also exposed to foreign currency risk related to the current assets and current liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries  in particular  our consolidated joint venture denominated in yen 
cumulative unrealized translation losses related to the consolidation of our japan entity amounted to  or approximately of total unrealized translation losses included in shareholder s equity at december  although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
