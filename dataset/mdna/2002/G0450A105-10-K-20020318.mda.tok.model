item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a bermuda public limited liability company with billion in equity capital and  through operations in bermuda and the united states  are positioned to write insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
while we are positioned to provide a full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines  we are focusing on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance profitably and earning a superior return on equity as we establish an enduring underwriting franchise 
recent events have provided a significant market opportunity for well capitalized insurance companies that are not burdened by the uncertainties resulting from prior years underwriting losses and material reinsurance recoverable balances 
as a result  we recently launched an underwriting initiative that included the recruitment of new insurance and reinsurance management teams and an equity capital infusion of million 
it is our belief that our existing bermuda and us based underwriting platform  our strong management team and our billion in capital that is unencumbered by significant exposure to pre risks have enabled us both to establish an immediate presence in an increasingly attractive insurance marketplace and to actively participate in the january  reinsurance renewal season 
since january   we have entered into approximately reinsurance treaties and other reinsurance arrangements which are expected to provide approximately million of gross written reinsurance premiums during new underwriting initiative and november  capital infusion on october   we announced the launch of a new underwriting initiative to meet current and future demand in the global insurance and reinsurance markets 
simultaneously with the launch of this new underwriting initiative  we entered into agreements with the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds and certain members of management to purchase from us in a private placement  for million in cash   series a convertible preference shares and  class a warrants 
this capital infusion was consummated on november  the proceeds of the capital infusion were primarily contributed to our bermuda and us subsidiaries to support the new underwriting initiative 
events prior to the new underwriting initiative acquisitions 
on february   we acquired one of our investee companies  american independent insurance company american independent 
american independent underwrites private passenger automobile liability and physical damage insurance primarily in the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
during  of american independent s written premiums were ceded to third party reinsurers 
during  we expect that approximately of american independent s written premiums will be ceded to third party reinsurers 
on june   we acquired all of the remaining ownership interests in arch risk transfer services ltd 
art services  which provides insurance and alternative risk transfer services through rent a captive and other facilities 
first american insurance company  a subsidiary of art services  is an admitted insurer in states with an am best rating of a excellent 
during  approximately of art services written premiums were ceded to third party reinsurers 
during  we expect that less than half of art services written premiums will be ceded to third party reinsurers 
the results of operations of american independent and art services are included in our financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
prior to the date of acquisition of art services  we accounted for our initial ownership interest in art services under the equity method 
we entered into a definitive agreement on september  to acquire rock river insurance company  an approved excess and surplus lines insurer in states and the district of columbia and an admitted insurer in two other states  for million 
we consummated this acquisition on february  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the existing policies and other liabilities of rock river reinsured or otherwise assumed by the seller  sentry insurance  a mutual company  which has an am best rating of a superior 
at february   rock river had net assets of approximately million 
formation of bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary on may   we formed our wholly owned bermuda based reinsurance subsidiary  arch re bermuda 
under the insurance act of  arch re bermuda is registered as a class and long term insurer and reinsurer and  in december  arch re bermuda and arch re us  our wholly owned us based reinsurance subsidiary  were assigned ratings of a excellent by am best 
change of legal domicile to bermuda on november   we completed an internal reorganization that resulted in our changing our legal domicile to bermuda 
in that transaction  the shareholders of arch capital us formerly risk capital holdings inc became the shareholders of acgl 
prior to the reorganization  acgl had no significant assets or capitalization and had not engaged in any business or prior activities other than in connection with the reorganization 
may sale of our prior reinsurance operations on may   we sold our prior reinsurance operations to folksamerica reinsurance company 
the folksamerica transaction was structured as a transfer and assumption agreement and not reinsurance  and  accordingly  the loss reserves and any related reinsurance recoverables relating to the transferred business are not included as assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
however  in the event that folksamerica is unable to make payment of claims on the reinsurance business assumed by it in the may sale  we would be liable for such claims 
folksamerica has an am best rating of a excellent 
see note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our financial statements 
see risk factors risks relating to our company we sold our prior reinsurance operations in may and may have liability to the purchaser and continuing liability from those reinsurance operations if the purchaser should fail to make payments on the reinsurance liabilities it assumed 
in connection with that sale we placed million of the purchase price in escrow 
the agreement required that these funds would be held for a period of five years to reimburse folksamerica if certain loss reserves transferred to it in the asset sale became deficient as measured at the end of such five year period or to satisfy certain indemnity claims folksamerica may have had during such period 
in february  we reached a definitive settlement agreement with folksamerica pursuant to which we will satisfy all of our obligations under the escrow agreement for an amount equal to approximately million  plus accrued interest income of million  in cash 
liquidity and capital resources acgl is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries 
generally  we depend on our available cash resources  liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to make payments  including the payment of operating expenses we may incur and for any dividends our board of directors may determine  and we may need to utilize funds from such sources in connection with acquisitions 
acgl does not currently intend to declare any dividends or make any other distributions 
the ability of our regulated insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards 
prior approval of the bermuda supervisor of insurance is required if any dividend payments or other distributions of arch re bermuda would reduce its total statutory capital by or more 
at december   arch re bermuda had statutory capital of million 
as of december  our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not pay any significant dividends or distributions during without prior regulatory approval 
in addition  the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies 
our ratings from these rating agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance subsidiaries 
pursuant to a shareholders agreement that we entered into in connection with the capital infusion  we have agreed not to declare any dividend or make any other distribution on our common shares  and not to repurchase any common shares  until we have repurchased from the warburg pincus funds  the hellman friedman funds and the other holders of our preference shares  pro rata  on the basis of the amount of each of these shareholders investment in us at the time of such repurchase  preference shares having an aggregate value of million  at a per share price acceptable to these shareholders 
our new underwriting initiative and related capital infusion are designed to position us to address current and anticipated future needs for capacity in the global insurance marketplace 
during the fourth quarter of  we expanded our underwriting activities  initially with a primary focus on reinsurance  and we intend to continue to expand significantly our insurance and reinsurance underwriting activities in the future 
our aggregate invested assets  including cash and short term investments  totaled billion at december   compared to million at december  the increase in cash and invested assets from to resulted primarily from the receipt of the proceeds from the capital infusion in november as of december   our readily available cash  short term investments and marketable securities  excluding amounts held by our regulated insurance subsidiaries  totaled million 
such amount consisted of million of cash and short term investments and million of fixed maturity investments 
as of that date  investments that are restricted or generally unavailable for liquidity purposes other than our ownership interests in our subsidiaries and the invested assets of our regulated insurance subsidiaries included million of privately held securities and million of fixed maturity investments held in escrow in connection with the sale of our prior reinsurance operations to folksamerica in may in addition  at december   we had investment commitments relating to our privately held investment  distribution investors  llc  of approximately million 
in connection with the capital infusion on november   we were released from our obligations to make any further capital contributions to trident ii  other than with respect to outstanding capital calls of approximately million  which we funded in november cash flows are provided by premiums collected  fee income  investment income excluding net realized investment gains and collected reinsurance receivable balances  offset by reinsurance premiums payable  loss and loss expense payments and operating costs 
consolidated cash flows provided by used for operating activities for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in cash flow in was primarily due to an increase in reinsurance recoverables at american independent  and start up costs related to the new underwriting initiative 
our expanded underwriting activities will initially be supported by our capital  and we expect that our other operational needs for the foreseeable future will be met by our balance of cash and short term investments  as well as by funds generated from premiums and investment income and proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments 
we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
it permits us to issue various types of securities  including unsecured debt securities  preference shares and common shares  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments set forth below  in tabular form  is information as of december  for the periods indicated below concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under long term obligations contractual obligations less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating leases     we are in the process of putting in place a letter of credit facility for up to million 
we expect that this facility will have a one year term 
the purpose of this facility is to issue standby letters of credit in favor of primary insurance or reinsurance counterparties with which we have entered into reinsurance arrangements 
such letters of credit when issued will be secured by a first priority  perfected security interest in investment securities 
any issued letters of credit will expire days from the date of issuance 
we have agreed to make a non recourse loan of up to million to our chairman  which will be used to pay income and self employment taxes  payable in april  on restricted shares granted to him on october  see note  commitments  of the notes accompanying our financial statements 
investments at december   consolidated cash and invested assets totaled approximately billion  consisting of million of cash and short term investments  million of publicly traded fixed maturity investments  million of short term investments held in escrow  million of privately held securities and million of publicly traded equity securities 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
the risk of investing in such securities is generally greater than the risk of investing in securities of widely held  publicly traded companies 
lack of a secondary market and resale restrictions may result in an inability by us to sell a security at a price that would otherwise be obtainable if such restrictions did not exist and may substantially delay the sale of a security we seek to sell 
at december   our private equity portfolio consisted of eight investments  with additional investment portfolio commitments in an aggregate amount of approximately million 
see note  investment information  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
at december   almost all of our fixed maturity and short term investments were rated investment grade by moody s or standard poor s and had an average standard poor s quality rating of aa and an average duration of approximately years 
we have not invested in derivative financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options or other financial instruments with similar characteristics such as interest rate caps or floors and fixed rate loan commitments 
our portfolio includes market sensitive instruments  such as mortgage backed securities  which are subject to prepayment risk and changes in market value in connection with changes in interest rates 
our investments in mortgage backed securities  which amounted to approximately million at december   or of cash and invested assets  are classified as available for sale and are not held for trading purposes 
results of operations comparisons of our and results of operations to each other and to prior year periods are not relevant due to the changes in our business during and  including the sale of our prior reinsurance operations in may  our change of legal domicile and reorganization completed in november  our recent acquisition activity  our new underwriting initiative and the capital infusion 
in addition  because of these factors  as well as the other factors noted in cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  our historical financial results do not provide you with a meaningful measure of our future results 
we have attempted to describe certain of these potential changes below 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
requires certain disclosures about operating segments in a manner that is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the segment 
at december   our primary operating segment was insurance 
in  we expect to operate in two different business segments  insurance and reinsurance 
we had consolidated net income loss of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net income is primarily a result of the effects of the sale of our prior reinsurance operations in may  the realignment of our investment portfolio in connection with the sale of our prior reinsurance operations and the realization of gains thereon in connection therewith  and the reversal of a portion of the deferred tax valuation allowance  which was originally established as a result of that sale 
such reversal resulted primarily from the expected tax effects of the new underwriting initiative at our us based underwriting operations 
based on all information available to us to date  we believe that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries do not have any material exposures to the events of september  underwriting activities for the year ended december   premiums written  losses incurred and commissions and brokerage resulted primarily from the acquisitions of american independent and art services 
the corresponding amounts for the years ended december  and december  reflect the results of our prior reinsurance operations which were sold in may approximately of the net premiums written were attributable to american independent  and approximately were attributable to art services 
the remaining was attributable to new business written by arch re bermuda effective december  we expect that our new underwriting initiative and improving market conditions will produce very substantial growth in our direct  assumed and net premiums written in a summary of premiums written is as follows year ended december  in millions direct premiums written assumed premiums written gross premiums written ceded premiums written subtotal unearned premium portfolio transfer and assumption net premiums written reinsurance ceded we follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures  paying to reinsurers and retrocessionaires a part of the premiums received on the policies we write 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires and attempt to place coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
during  we ceded approximately two thirds of our business written on a proportional basis in accordance with our then current business plan 
comparisons of premiums written between and are not meaningful because of the changes in our business discussed above 
at december   substantially all of our reinsurance recoverables were due from carriers which had an am best rating of a or better and we had no amounts recoverable from a single entity or group of entities that exceeded of shareholders equity 
as a result of the new underwriting initiative and our enhanced financial position  we expect to retain a significant amount of business written by american independent and art services as well as premiums written by arch re bermuda and arch re us 
in  reinsurance may be purchased on both a facultative and treaty basis primarily to reduce net liability on individual risks and  if deemed necessary  to reduce our exposure to catastrophic losses 
net investment income at december   approximately of our invested assets consisted of fixed maturity and short term investments  exclusive of securities held in escrow  compared to at december  net investment income was approximately million in  compared to million in and million in such amounts for  and are net of investment expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the investment expense amounts include investment advisory fees of million  million and million  respectively 
the and net investment expenses are offset by advisory fee income that we received from mmc capital  inc in the amount of million 
the decrease in net investment income in compared with reflected primarily the decline in our average invested asset base resulting from the sale of our prior reinsurance operations 
the impact was partially offset by investment income earned on the proceeds received from the capital infusion in november as well as the inclusion of the results of american independent and art services 
the decrease in net investment income in compared with primarily reflected the decline in our average invested asset base resulting from the sale of our prior reinsurance operations  partially offset by the decrease in investment expenses described above and a higher interest rate environment 
our investment yields at amortized cost were as follows for the periods set forth below year ended december  investment yields pre tax net of tax proceeds from the capital infusion were initially invested in short duration  high quality fixed maturities and short term investments 
yields on future investment income may vary based on investment allocation decisions  economic conditions and other factors 
investment yields in and reflect a significant allocation of the total investment portfolio in equity securities  which yield less current income than fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  public and private equity securities approximated and  respectively  of total cash and invested assets 
additionally such investment yields exclude the equity in net income or loss of private equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
reserve for loss of escrowed assets in connection with the definitive settlement agreement reached with folksamerica in february as described above under general may sale of our prior reinsurance operations  for  we recorded an after tax benefit of million to reflect the net effects of this agreement 
during  our net loss included an after tax charge of million related to the escrowed assets 
see note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses other operating expenses were million in  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the acquisitions 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred approximately million of costs from the formation of our new reinsurance operations 
we expect that we will incur a significant amount of additional costs in in connection with the expected increase in our insurance and reinsurance operations 
provision for non cash compensation during  we made certain grants to new and existing employees under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements  resulting in pre tax charges of million 
these grants were made primarily in connection with our new underwriting initiative  which resulted in the increase in non cash compensation in as a result of the new initiative  we expect to reflect a significant increase in non cash compensation in in and  we made grants under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements that resulted in pre tax charges of million and million  respectively 
net realized gains losses on investments our sources of net realized investment gains losses were as follows years ended december  in thousands fixed maturities    publicly traded equity securities    privately held securities   subtotal    loss on fixed maturities included in gain on sale of prior reinsurance operations  net realized investment gains    income tax expense    net realized investment gains  net of tax    income taxes under current bermuda law  we are not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
we have received a written undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits  income  gain or appreciation on any capital asset  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax will not be applicable to us or our operations until march  this undertaking does not  however  prevent the imposition of taxes on any person ordinarily resident in bermuda or any company in respect of its ownership of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda 
acgl and our bermuda and other non us subsidiaries will be subject to non us federal income tax to the extent that they derive us source income that is subject to us withholding tax or income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states and is not exempt from us tax under an applicable income tax treaty with the united states 
they will be subject to a withholding tax on dividends from us investments and interest from certain us payors 
in addition  arch re bermuda will be subject to excise taxes on united states insurance and reinsurance premiums received by it 
we do not consider acgl or our bermuda or other non us subsidiaries to be engaged in a trade or business within the united states and  consequently  do not expect them to be subject to direct us income taxation 
see risk factors risks relating to taxation and business tax matters 
our us subsidiaries will continue to be subject to us income taxes on their worldwide income 
our income tax expense was million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was lower than the us federal income tax rate of primarily as a result of a reduction in the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets  which was slightly offset by foreign losses not subject to us tax 
this reduction resulted primarily from the expected tax effects of the new underwriting initiative at our us based underwriting operations  which included an increase in our on shore investment portfolio 
our income tax expense was million  compared with an income tax benefit of million in in  income tax expense on our pre tax net loss included a charge to establish a valuation allowance of million that adjusted our deferred income tax asset to its estimated realizable value 
income tax expense for also included the write off of certain deferred tax assets in the amount of million in connection with our change of legal domicile to bermuda 
in  arch re us s underwriting results had significantly deteriorated  resulting in a pre tax net loss that generated an income tax benefit for the year 
at december   the net deferred income tax asset was million after reflecting a valuation allowance of million recorded to reduce the net deferred income tax asset to the amount that management expects to more likely than not be realized 
this valuation allowance primarily relates to certain deferred income tax assets of art services  which was acquired during  and also reflects the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded at december  due to the expected tax effects of the new underwriting initiative  as discussed above 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million that adjusted the net deferred income tax asset to its estimated realizable value of million 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance because we believed at that time the entire deferred tax asset was realizable due to our ability to generate future taxable income 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements valuation allowance 
we have net operating loss carryforwards totaling million at december  such net operating losses are currently available to offset our future taxable income and expire between and we also have an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward in the amount of million which can be carried forward without expiration 
on november   we underwent an ownership change for us federal income tax purposes as a result of the capital infusion 
as a result of this ownership change  limitations are imposed upon the utilization of our existing net operating losses 
upon our change of legal domicile to bermuda in november  arch capital us distributed substantially all of its public equity portfolio to its bermuda parent  acgl  at the then current market values and realized gains for tax purposes of million 
the associated us federal income tax expense of million reduced our net operating loss carryforwards by a corresponding amount 
however  for financial reporting purposes  since the securities had not been sold to an unrelated third party  the realized gain had been deferred and was reported as unrealized appreciation in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the income tax expense was also deferred and reduced unrealized appreciation in the consolidated financial statements 
in  we divested of this public equity portfolio in its entirety and  accordingly  have recognized the us federal income tax expense of million in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  see note  income taxes  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
market sensitive instruments and risk management the following analysis presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which are held by us as of december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and is comprised of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and invested assets  excluding investments carried under the equity method of accounting 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risks on the private equity securities included in our investment portfolio 
all of our privately held securities were issued by insurance and reinsurance companies or companies providing services to the insurance and reinsurance industry 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
investments in privately held securities issued by privately held companies may include both equity securities and securities convertible into  or exercisable for  equity securities some of which may have fixed maturities 
our privately held equity securities  which at december  were carried at a fair value of million  have exposure to price risk 
the estimated potential losses in fair value for our privately held equity portfolios resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market prices  dealer quotes or fair value is million 
interest rate risk the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate adverse shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would result in a decrease in total return of  which would produce a decrease in market value of million on our fixed maturity investment portfolio  valued at million at december  there would be no material impact on our short term investments 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to insurance and other reserves  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues and related expenses insurance premiums written are recorded in accordance with the terms of the underlying policies 
reinsurance premiums assumed are recognized as income on a straight line basis over the terms of the related reinsurance contracts 
these amounts are based on reports received from ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums for which ceding company reports have not been received 
subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period they are determined 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of contracts in force 
certain of our contracts included provisions that adjusted premiums or acquisition costs based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned as well as related acquisition expenses under those contracts are recorded based upon the expected ultimate experience under these contracts 
acquisition costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of policies  consisting principally of commissions and brokerage expenses incurred at the time a contract is issued  are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value based on the related unearned premiums and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses  based on historical and current experience and anticipated investment income 
losses and loss adjustment expenses insurance reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
we utilize actuarial models as well as historical insurance and reinsurance industry loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of appropriate claim reserves 
in contrast to casualty claims  which frequently can be determined only through lengthy and unpredictable litigation  non casualty property claims tend to be reported promptly and usually are settled within a shorter period of time 
nevertheless  for both casualty and property claims  actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
for reinsurance assumed  such reserves are based on reports received from ceding companies  supplemented by our estimates of reserves for which ceding company reports have not been received  and our own historical experience 
if our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are determined to be inadequate  we will be required to increase the reserves with a corresponding reduction in net income in the period in which the deficiency is determined 
it is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period or our financial condition in general 
even though most insurance contracts have policy limits  the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and could very significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies 
we will attempt to limit our risk of loss through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
collection of insurance balances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect premiums 
in addition  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance and retrocessions because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the companies we reinsure 
if the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in addition  if we subsequently assessed that the valuation allowance was no longer needed  then a benefit would be recorded to income in the period such determination was made 
investments we currently classify all of our publicly traded fixed maturity  short term investments and equity securities as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity securities and publicly traded equity securities is estimated using quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
stock issued to employees we follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
accordingly  under apb no 
 compensation expense for stock option grants is recognized by us to the extent that the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the measurement date 
in addition  under apb no 
 we do not recognize compensation expense for stock issued to employees under our stock purchase plan 
see note  stock and stock option plans  of the notes accompanying our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the purchase method of accounting to be applied for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we do not expect the application of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
in addition  sfas no 
includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
at december   we had goodwill of approximately million 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we will test our goodwill for impairment upon adoption and  if impairment is indicated  record such impairment as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
we have not yet developed an estimate of the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated results of operations 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends portions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and we adopted it on january  we do not expect the application of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation inflation may have an effect on us because inflationary factors can increase damage awards and potentially result in larger claims 
our underwriting philosophy is to adjust premiums in response to inflation  although this may not always be possible due to competitive pressure 
inflationary factors will be considered in determining the premium level on any multi year policies at the time contracts are written
