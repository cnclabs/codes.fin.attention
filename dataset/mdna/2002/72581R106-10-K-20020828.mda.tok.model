critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are several accounting policies that are important to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy we derive our revenues from the sale of licenses and services and maintenance 
license and maintenance revenues are normally generated from licensing our products with end users  value added resellers and application service providers and  to a lesser extent  through distribution of third party products 
service revenues are generated from consulting services and education services sold to end users 
we recognize license revenues on delivery of our solutions to the customer when all of the following conditions have been satisfied o there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement  o the fee is fixed or determinable we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and if we have not granted extended payment terms to the customer  and o the collection of the license fee is probable we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
revenues for multiple element arrangements  which could consist of software licenses  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance and consulting services  are allocated among the component elements based upon the relative fair value of each element 
the fair value of each element is determined by the price charged by us when that element is sold separately  or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  by the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
we enter into reseller and sub licensing arrangements that provide a fee payable to us based on a percentage of list prices 
we recognize revenue only on the net fee payable to us from the reseller upon sell through to the end customer by the reseller 
we typically sell first year maintenance with the related software license 
revenue related to maintenance is recognized evenly over the term of the maintenance contract  typically one year 
revenues relating to technical support and maintenance have increased due to our increasing customer base and the renewal of technical support and maintenance contracts upon expiration of first year maintenance arrangements 
we recognize revenue from consulting  implementation services and education as these services are performed 
we derive revenue from these services primarily on a time and materials basis under a separate service arrangement with the customer 
in circumstances where we enter into fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which is measured based upon actual person hours performed 
much of the implementation services provided to our customers in connection with installations of our solutions are provided by third party consulting and implementation service providers 
these third party service providers ordinarily contract directly with the customer 
on occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time we have licensed our software to these organizations 
these transactions are negotiated separately and recorded at terms we consider to be arms length 
on january   we adopted topic no 
d topic d requires that certain out of pocket expenses re billed to customers be recorded as revenue versus an offset to the related expense 
prior to the adoption of topic d  we recorded re billed out of pocket expenses as an offset to the related expense 
comparative financial statements for prior periods have been conformed to the current year presentation 
this change had no effect on operating income or net income for any period presented 
provision for doubtful accounts receivable we initially record our provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience of write offs and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  we consider the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of the customers  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by us will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal  we experienced delays in payments from certain customers resulting from a deterioration of financial conditions affecting these customers due to the weak north american economy and capital markets 
as a result  we recorded significant changes in our bad debts reserve 
during the twelve month periods ended june   and  we recorded provisions for doubtful debts of million  million and million  respectively 
restructuring and other charges pivotal has recorded restructuring charges associated with workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  contract settlements and asset impairments 
these charges are based on management s best estimate at the time of the restructuring  and are updated on a quarterly basis based on actual experience 
during the year ended june   these charges totaled million of which million related to restructuring activities  and million related to the impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
total cash charges were million  of which million had been paid prior to june  with the remaining million represented in accrued liabilities as at june  the current portion of this amount is million  with the balance of million representing the non current portion 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in the years ended june  and june   pivotal recorded impairment losses of million and million related to long lived assets having carrying values in excess of the cash flows expected to result from their disposal 
the charge for fiscal included million related to impairments of capital assets and million related to the impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
no such impairment loss had been identified by pivotal for the year ended june  investments in public and non public companies at june  and june   we held investments in publicly traded companies in which we held less than of the voting rights and over which we did not exercise significant influence 
the investments are included in goodwill  intangibles and other assets and are recorded at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices  with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value  an impairment charge is included in other income and expenses and previously recorded mark to market adjustments that were recorded in other comprehensive income are reversed 
during the year ended june   we recorded a writedown of related to other than temporary declines in the value of its investments in public companies 
we also held certain investments in non publicly traded companies in which we held less than of the voting rights and in which we do not exercise significant influence 
these investments are included in goodwill and other assets and are accounted for on a cost basis 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings and additional investments 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
this evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors by members of senior management  including a review of the investee s financial condition  results of operations  operating trends and other financial ratios 
we further consider the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  as well as market prices of comparable public companies 
during the year ended june   we recorded a charge of related to impairment in the value of investments in non public companies 
recent acquisitions during the year ended june   we completed the acquisitions of transitif  sa  exactium ltd 
and simba technologies inc during the year ended june   we completed acquisitions of ionysys technology corporation  project one business technologies inc  software spectrum crm  inc 
and inform  inc 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of each acquisition are included in our consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date  and the related assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
during the year ended june   we did not complete any acquisitions 
results of operations the following table sets forth the consolidated statement of operations data for each of the years in the three years ended june  expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended june  revenues license services and maintenance total revenues cost of revenues license services and maintenance total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring and other charges amortization of goodwill in process research and development and other charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income expenses interest and other income impairment of investments loss before income taxes income taxes net loss years ended june  and revenues total revenues decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  license revenues from licenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  our revenues from licenses decreased as a result of the recent economic slowdown in the latter half of through this change in economic conditions has had a direct impact on the buying patterns of our potential customers  as evidenced through reduced corporate capital budgets and longer sales cycles 
our license revenue growth depends on the overall demand for customer relationship management solutions 
the overall demand for our software depends in large part on the general economic and business conditions 
revenues from licenses represented and of total revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
license revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues primarily due to the fact that license revenues are more immediately impacted by changes in economic conditions  whereas service revenues are derived from longer term projects and also include maintenance revenues that tend to be recurring in nature 
north american license revenues accounted for and of total license revenues in the years ended june  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues as demand for our products increased as we expanded our european and other international operations combined with a weakening us economy 
no single customer accounted for or more of our revenues for the years ended june  and license revenues are difficult to forecast and will be significantly influenced by the overall global economy and corporate spending trends 
services and maintenance revenues from services and maintenance increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this resulted from an increase of million in revenues recognized from technical support and maintenance contracts  which entitle customers to new versions of our products and technical support and maintenance services and a decrease of million in revenues from implementation  education and consulting service engagements 
our revenues from services and maintenance represented and of total revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we believe that revenues from services and maintenance will decrease over time as a percentage of total revenues  since we believe that license revenues will grow faster than services revenues in the near to medium term 
we intend to expand consulting services targeted at helping customers understand more about matters such as effective one to one marketing and using the internet to increase revenues and improve customer service 
we plan to continue relying on third parties to provide a majority of implementation services to our customers  rather than providing those services directly 
cost of revenues our cost of license revenues primarily consists of production  packaging and distribution of solutions and related documentation  as well as royalty fees due to third parties for integrated technology 
our cost of services revenues includes salaries and related expenses for our implementation  consulting  support and maintenance  and education organizations and an allocation of facilities  communications and depreciation expenses 
total cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  license cost of revenues from licenses consists of costs relating to the packaging and distribution of solutions  related documentation and other production costs and royalty fees paid for incorporation of third party solutions into our solutions 
cost of revenues from licenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in license sales 
cost of revenues from licenses as a percentage of revenues from licenses was for the year ended june  and for the year ended june  we expect that the cost of licenses as a percentage of revenue from licenses will remain at approximately the same levels as in prior periods 
services and maintenance cost of revenues from services and maintenance consists of personnel and other expenses relating to the cost of providing maintenance and customer support  education and consulting services 
cost of revenues from services and maintenance will vary depending on the mix of services we provide between support and maintenance  education  implementation and consulting services 
gross profit margins are higher for support and maintenance services than they are for education and consulting services 
support and maintenance services involve the delivery of software upgrades  which our customers download and install themselves and customer support 
education and consulting services generally require more involvement by our employees  resulting in higher compensation  travel and similar expenses 
cost of revenues from services and maintenance increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase in dollar amount resulted from a higher average number of consulting  customer support and education personnel during the year 
cost of revenues from services and maintenance as a percentage of revenues from services and maintenance was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we expect that cost of revenues from services and maintenance will range from to of revenues from services and maintenance 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
we allocate the costs for overhead  depreciation and facilities to each of the functional areas based on their proportional headcount 
in response to the weakening global economy  and the resulting impact on license revenues  we implemented a restructuring program in the fall of fiscal in order to bring costs in line with revised revenue forecasts 
this restructuring initiative resulted in significantly reduced operating costs in the second half of the year  as compared to the first half 
while we expect to continue to closely monitor expenditures and to continue cost control initiatives  we expect that operating expenses in the second half of fiscal are indicative of those to be expected in the first part of fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses and benefits earned by sales and marketing personnel  direct expenditures such as travel  communication and occupancy for direct sales offices  and marketing expenditures related to direct mail  online marketing  trade shows  advertising and promotion 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in dollar amounts is the result of a reduction in sales and marketing employees from to and a decrease in marketing program expenditures following the implementation of our restructuring plans 
commissions decreased due to lower sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to in the year ended june  from in the year ended june  this increase of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues resulted from lower revenues for the year ended june  we expect that sales and marketing expenditures  as a percentage of total revenues  will decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with new products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities and consist primarily of salaries  benefits and equipment for software engineers  quality assurance personnel  program managers  product managers  technical writers and outside contractors used to augment the research and development efforts 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development costs as incurred 
since license revenues from our solutions are not recognized until after technological feasibility has been established  software development costs are not generally expensed in the same period in which license revenues for the developed solutions are recognized 
there are no software development costs capitalized on our balance sheet 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease is the result of a reduction in employees and contract labor following the implementation of our restructuring plans 
research and development expenses were and of total revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we believe that r d activities are imperative to our strategic plans 
we may increase the level of r d expenditures  in absolute dollars  in order to expand our product line and ensure that our products remain competitive in the marketplace 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and occupancy costs for executive  finance  and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses also include legal and other professional fees and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues  respectively  for the same periods 
the decrease is a result of a reduction in general administration employees from to offset by an increase in bad debts expense 
the total bad debt expense was million and million for the years ended june  and the increase in bad debt expense was due to the fact that we experienced a delay in payments from certain customers resulting from a weakening in the global economy in the final quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal we have recently tightened our credit policies and procedures  however unanticipated charges may be incurred in future periods if economic conditions or the credit quality of individual customers further deteriorate 
over the next year we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues as compared to fiscal restructuring costs and other charges in light of the significant downturn in the north american and global economies and the related impact on corporate capital spending  we implemented restructuring plans in the second quarter of fiscal in order to streamline our operations and align our cost structure with revised revenue expectations 
we adjusted our restructuring plan during the year to reflect the continued deterioration in the industry and economic environment 
in connection with our restructuring plans  we recorded charges of million related to both restructuring activities and write downs of intangible assets 
these charges included costs of million associated with workforce reductions  consolidation of excess facilities  contract settlements and tangible asset impairments 
these charges also included million related to the impairment of previously recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
employee severance and related benefit costs for approximately terminated employees totaled approximately million 
the workforce reduction was primarily in the united states  canada and the united kingdom and extended across all geographical segments and business units 
as at june   we had made cash payments to terminated employees of million 
the remaining obligations will be paid in the first half of fiscal we incurred non cash charges of million related to asset impairments for certain capital assets that were either abandoned during the year or for which the resulting estimated future reduced cash flows were insufficient to cover the carrying amounts of the related assets 
the impairment of these assets was directly related the restructuring initiatives implemented during the year 
charges of million were incurred for remaining lease commitments  net of expected sublease income  and other costs related to facilities made redundant as a result of the workforce reduction and the discontinuance of previous expansion plans 
redundant facilities included certain corporate facilities  sales offices and research and development centers in north america and europe 
as at june   we had paid million associated with these charges  and the remaining obligations  which are comprised of future lease commitments  will be paid over the respective lease terms through to june the charges may be increased in future periods if further consolidations are required or if sublease income is less than expected 
we recorded charges of million for contract settlement costs including penalties expected to be incurred due to our withdrawal from certain purchase and partner contracts and for various unrecoverable prepaid expenses related to future services forfeited as a direct result of the restructuring 
the cash portion of these charges totaled million  of which million was paid prior to june  the remaining cash portion will be paid in fiscal if additional contracts are cancelled in future periods  or if additional unforeseen costs are incurred in respect of current contracts  this charge may increase 
as part of our review of financial results during the year ended june   we performed an impairment assessment of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill recorded in connection with our past acquisitions 
the impairment assessment was performed due to changes in overall economic conditions that have negatively impacted our revenues and forecasted revenue growth rates 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with acquisitions and other purchased intangibles to its estimated fair value 
this impairment charge was primarily associated with the acquisitions of exactium ltd 
and digital conversations inc formerly simba technologies inc  software spectrum crm  inc 
and project one business technologies inc to determine the impairment loss for goodwill  we determined the fair value of our recorded intangible asests using a business enterprise methodology that included a terminal value assigned to the related entities 
this value was then compared to the carrying value  and if less  the difference represented the impairment to be recorded 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the estimated terminal values  reflect management s best estimates 
it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used under this assessment may change in the short term  resulting in the need to further write down the goodwill and other long lived assets 
in addition  it is possible that we may have additional reductions in goodwill in future periods 
our potential for future profitability depends on our ability to align costs and expenses to expected revenues 
if general economic and business conditions continue to soften  or if the demand for our products or customer relationship management products and services in general is less than we forecast  or if we are unable to maintain costs and expenses within our targeted range  we may incur additional restructuring charges in subsequent periods 
amortization of goodwill amortization of goodwill was million in the year ended june  and million in the year ended june  the decrease resulted from a million charge recorded in the quarter ended december  for the impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended june  is comprised of amortization for additions to goodwill for acquisitions which totaled million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
included in goodwill is million in additional consideration  of which  was paid during the year ended june   in connection with earn out amounts due to former principals of project one 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination and sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets 
these standards require all future business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
we adopted sfas no 
as of july   although it has not had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on a prospective basis as of july  we will complete an initial goodwill impairment assessment in to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas no 
interest and other income interest and other income consists of earnings on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments net of interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on investments 
interest and other income was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease of million during the year ended june  was due primarily to our lower average cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances held during the year  combined with lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances

impairment of investments during the fiscal year ended june   we incurred a charge of million related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of our investments in a private company and a public company 
similar charges were not incurred in fiscal income taxes the provision for income taxes was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
these income tax amounts were attributable to our operations in the united states  the united kingdom and france 
the provisions for taxes for the year ended june  was offset by  related to canadian research and development tax incentives received during the years ended june  years ended june  and revenues total revenues increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  licenses revenues from licenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  our revenues from licenses increased due to sale of licenses to new customers and to follow on sales to existing customers 
these increases were attributable to increased market acceptance of our solutions and increased sales as a result of our expansion of our direct and indirect channels of distribution both in north america and internationally 
in addition  we believe that the availability of new features added to the pivotal crm suite has increased revenues as this has extended the overall functionality of our solutions by permitting organizations to collaborate with customers and partners over the internet

 revenues license services and maintenance total revenues cost of revenues license services and maintenance total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring costs and other charges amortization of goodwill total operating expenses loss from operations other income expenses interest and other income impairment of investments loss before income taxes income taxes net loss for the year ended june  we experienced an increase in revenues during our second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters  which we believe was primarily related to increased license sales to new customers  follow on license sales to existing customers  and an increased number of technical support and maintenance contracts due to a growth in our customer base 
we believe the decrease in revenue in the quarters ended june  and september  were due to the economic slowdown and related reluctance of companies to acquire significant software and systems during this time 
in addition  a pattern of reduced buying by european customers during july and august has resulted in lower european license revenues in the quarters ended september the decrease in operating expenses  excluding restructuring costs and other charges  beginning in the quarter ended december  is a result of a reduction in employees and marketing program expenditures following the implementation of our restructuring plans as well as increased operating efficiencies and decreased commissions due to lower sales 
these costs are expected to remain approximately the same in the first quarter of fiscal we will continue to examine the level of sales and marketing costs based on revenue projections 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result of our limited operating history  recent acquisitions and restructuring  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on historical results 
accordingly  we base our anticipated level of expense in part on future revenue projections 
most of our expenses are fixed in the short term and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to forecast our quarterly revenues accurately is limited given our limited operating history  length of the sales cycle of our solutions and other uncertainties in our business 
if revenues in a particular quarter do not meet projections  our net losses in a given quarter would be greater than expected 
as a result  we believe that our quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million in total working capital 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million as of june  from million as of june  our working capital decreased to million at june  from million at june net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was million compared to net cash used of million in the same period in this increase was primarily due to the higher net loss incurred during the year ended june   which included million of cash related restructuring charges 
net cash provided by investing activities was million during the year ended june  and net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  during the year ended june  we received proceeds of million from the sale and maturity of short term investments and proceeds of million from the sale and leaseback of assets  whereas during the year ended june  we used million for net purchases of short term investments 
capital expenditures totalled million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
long term investments and other assets totaled million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
during the year ended june   there were no acquisitions 
during the year ended june   we used million net of cash acquired on acquisitions including ionysys  project one  software spectrum  and inform 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  resulted primarily from the issuance of common shares 
as of june   our future fixed commitments for cash payments primarily related to obligations under non cancelable operating and capital leases 
we lease facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring between and and certain equipment under non cancelable operating and capital leases expiring between and future minimum lease payments and other future fixed commitments for the years ending june are as follows years ending june  thousands total capital leases and long term debt restructuring liabilities   operating leases excluding amounts charged to restructuring        licencing commitments   total cash obligations        our principal source of liquidity at june  was our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have a credit agreement with a canadian chartered bank  which includes a revolving letter of credit facility of million  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate plus per year  secured by a charge on all our current and future personal property 
as of june  and  letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively  were outstanding to secure facilities and equipment lease obligations 
our accounts receivable at june   were days of sales outstanding  which is below our target range of to days 
days of sales outstanding decreased because of our improved collection procedures  a more even distribution of sales during the fourth quarter  and the additional provision for doubtful accounts 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of to million in the first half of fiscal  largely due to our move to new vancouver head office facilities  as well as various upgrades to our computer systems infrastructure 
we believe that the total amount of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  along with the credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital or other purposes at least for the next months 
thereafter  depending on the development of our business  we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses 
in the interim  however  lower than anticipated revenues  higher than anticipated expenses  or opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash commitments  or other unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time 
if we need to raise additional cash  financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all

audit committee pivotal has an audit committee of the board of directors  the charter of which is to oversee the activities of management and our external auditors as they relate to the financial reporting process 
currently  the audit committee is comprised of robin louis  jeremy jaech  steven gordon and howard gwin 
in particular  the audit committee s role includes ensuring that management properly develops and adheres to a sound system of internal controls  and that our external auditors  through their own review  assess the effectiveness of those controls and management s adherence to them

in these meetings  the audit committee discussed with management and our external auditors the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and significant transactions or issues encountered during the period 
in addition  the audit committee met with our external auditors independent of management to provide for independent and confidential assessment of management and the internal controls as they relate to the quality and reliability of our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments  including government bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk 
these investments are typically denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances and are only invested in demand or short term deposits of the local operating bank 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
under this policy  all short term investments must be made in investment grade securities with original maturities of less than one year at the time of acquisition 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments due to the short term nature of the investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of june   the fair value of our short term investment portfolio would not be materially impacted by a shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points 
other investments included in other assets are certain investments in public and private companies 
our investment in two public companies are considered available for sale and are subject to considerable market price volatility and are additionally risky due to resale restrictions 
the investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we may lose some or all of our investment in those shares 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in the equity price would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of june  during the year ended june   we recorded a writedown of million related to an other than temporary decline in the value of investments in public companies 
our investments in privately held companies are carried at cost less writedowns related to other than temporary declines 
these investments are inherently risky  as they typically are comprised of investments in companies that are still in start up or development stages 
the market for their product or technologies that they have under development is typically in the early stages  and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies or may incur an impairment charge if we determine that the value of these assets has been impaired 
during the year ended june   we recorded a charge of million related to an impairment in the value of investments in non public companies 
foreign currency risk we have operations in canada and a number of countries outside of the united states and therefore we are subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our sales and corresponding receivables are substantially in us dollars 
through our operations in canada and outside north america  we incur the majority of our research and development  customer support costs and administrative expenses in canadian and other local currencies 
we are exposed  in the normal course of business  to foreign currency risks on these expenditures 
we have evaluated our exposure to these risks and have determined that our only significant foreign currency exposure at this time is to the canadian dollar through our operations in canada 
at this time  we do not believe our exposure to other currencies is material 
on occasion  we use forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with transactions originating in canadian dollars 
we have not designated these forward contracts to be hedging instruments 
therefore  all gains or losses resulting from the change in fair value of these contracts have been included in earnings in the current period 
if we were to designate these types of forward contracts or other derivatives as hedges in the future and such derivatives satisfy the criteria for hedging instruments  then depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivatives will be offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments recognized in earnings fair value hedges or recognized in other comprehensive income until the related hedged item is recognized in earnings cash flow hedges 
any change in fair value related to the ineffective portion of a derivative will be recognized in earnings through periodic mark to market adjustments 
in addition to the use of foreign exchange forward contracts noted above  from time to time we may also purchase canadian dollars in the open market and hold these funds in order to satisfy forecasted operating needs in canadian dollars for the next operating period  which is generally limited to six months or less 
if our actual currency requirement in the period forecasted differs materially from the notional amount of our forward contracts and or the amount of canadian dollars purchased in the open market during a period of currency volatility or if we do not continue to manage our exposure to foreign currency through forward contracts or other means  we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses 
our foreign currency risk management policy subjects us to risks relating to the creditworthiness of the commercial banks with which we enter into forward contracts 
if one of these banks cannot honor its obligations  we may suffer a loss 
we also invest in our international operations which will likely result in increased future operating expenses denominated in united kingdom and irish pounds  french francs  euros  german marks  japanese yen  australian dollars and new zealand dollars 
our exposure to exchange fluctuations in foreign currencies has not been material to date and accordingly  our current foreign currency risk management practices do not cover foreign exchange risks related to these other currencies 
in the future  our exposure to foreign currency risks from these other foreign currencies may increase and if not managed appropriately  we could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains and losses 
the purpose of our foreign currency risk management policy is to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuation on our results of operations 
therefore  while our foreign currency risk management policy may reduce our exposure to losses resulting from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates  it also reduces or eliminates our ability to profit from favorable changes in currency exchange rates 
at june  and june   we had no outstanding currency forward exchange contracts 
during the year ended june   we recorded a foreign exchange gain of  compared to a gain of  during the year ended june
