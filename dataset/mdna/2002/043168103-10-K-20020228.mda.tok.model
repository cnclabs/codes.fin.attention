revenues from art s way branded products were down while oem sales decreased 
the reduction in sales reflects the continuing weakness in the farm economy 
the agricultural niche markets the company serves were all hit very hard by declining prices in both livestock and commodities 
the sugar beet industry has suffered from over production and increasing competition from the sugar cane industry and competition from foreign sources 
these market situations and a general lack of confidence by us farmers in the direction the us agricultural industry will move has adversely affected the company 
the one main area of good activity was the cattle industry where increased demand for beef caused an increase in beef cattle prices  which resulted in good demand for our feed processing equipment 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from for the year ended november  to for the year ended november  this decrease was primarily due to selling old inventory at distressed prices and a  inventory valuation writedown to realign the inventory values to current market conditions in the agricultural industry

utilization of deferred tax assets the company has established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately  and  at november  and  respectively  due to the uncertainty of realizing various net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets for these years  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the expiration dates of tax credits and carryforwards and projected future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of the november  net deferred tax assets
