item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
factors that may affect future stock performance the performance of our common stock is dependent upon several factors including those set forth below and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
control by majority shareholders  ability to issue preferred stock mr 
david a 
schuff  our chairman and co founder  and mr 
scott a 
schuff  our president  chief executive officer  co founder and a member of our board of directors  collectively control the voting of approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these individuals control the vote on all matters requiring approval of the stockholders  including causing or restricting our sale or merger 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  the designation  
table of contents number  voting powers  preferences  and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock 
volatility of stock price the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market for many companies and have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the market price of the common stock is also subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results  analyst reports  announcements concerning our business  legislative or regulatory changes or the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting our business  litigation  general trends in the industry and other events or factors 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock for per share 
since that time  our common stock has traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
the market price for our common stock remains volatile and there is no assurance that the market price will not experience significant changes in the future 
shares eligible for future sale there were  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  of these shares   shares of common stock are freely tradable 
the  remaining shares of common stock are beneficially held by messrs 
david a 
schuff and scott a 
schuff and are restricted securities as that term is defined under rule promulgated under the securities act of the securities act 
in general  under rule as currently in effect  subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions  if one year has elapsed since the later of the date of acquisition of restricted shares from either an issuer or an affiliate of an issuer  the acquirer or subsequent holder is entitled to sell in the open market  within any three month period  a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of one percent of the outstanding shares of the same class or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of the required notice of sale 
of the restricted securities outstanding  all of these shares have been held for the one year holding period required under rule no predictions can be made with respect to the effect  if any  that sales of common stock in the market or the availability of shares of common stock for sale under rule will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the open market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock and may make it more difficult for us to sell our equity securities in the future on terms it deems appropriate

table of contents gives effect to our acquisition of b k steel fabrications  inc b k steel on january   which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
financial information relating to b k steel has not been included in periods prior to the acquisition 
gives effect to our acquisitions of addison and quincy on june   six on august   and bannister on october   which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
financial information relating to addison  quincy  six and bannister has not been included in periods prior to the acquisitions 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering in july  we elected to be treated as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of as an s corporation  we were not subject to income taxes 
pro forma income taxes reflect the provision for income taxes that would have been recorded had we been subject to income taxes as a c corporation for all periods  assuming an effective tax rate of 
provision for income taxes for includes credits of  to income recorded upon revocation of our s corporation election in june backlog is the amount of potential future revenues to be recognized upon performance of contracts awarded to us 
backlog increases as new contract commitments  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders are received  decreases as revenues are recognized  and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under a contract or potential contract 
of our million backlog as of december   approximately million was attributable to one project for a single customer in arizona and approximately million was attributable to one project for a single customer in california 
restricted funds on deposit represent funds on deposit in interest bearing escrow accounts  which are maintained in lieu of retention for specific contracts 
retentions on contract receivables are amounts due which are withheld until the completed project has been accepted by the customer in accordance with the contract 
we recognize revenues and costs from construction projects using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon either the ratio of the costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours  commencing when progress is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy 
construction contracts with customers generally provide that billings are to be made monthly in amounts which are commensurate with the extent of performance under the contracts 
costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts primarily represent revenues earned under the percentage of completion method which have not been billed 
billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts represent amounts billed on contracts in excess of the revenues allowed to be recognized under the percentage of completion method on those contracts 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information regarding our financial and operating position as of december  and  and our results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
recent developments during the third and fourth quarters of  the commercial construction industry experienced a dramatic downturn as a result of macroeconomic conditions and the terrorist attacks of september  these factors resulted in elongated selling cycles and reduced demand for our products and services  especially in leisure and tourism based construction projects 
the net results were lower revenues and depressed gross margins across all of our business units and in projects both large and small 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have adopted the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we perform our services primarily under fixed price contracts and recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon either the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours 
revenue recognition begins when progress is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy 
revenues relating to changes in the scope of a contract are recognized when the customer has authorized the change  the work is commenced and we have made an estimate of the amount that will be paid for the change 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which revisions become known 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable  actual write off history  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market under the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value many not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review included the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of income 
based on preliminary steps we have taken to prepare for the adoption of statement  it is likely that a substantial portion of the goodwill related to our acquisitions will be impaired  resulting in a significant cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we feel that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our net deferred tax liability was  legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates as necessary 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 

table of contents overview our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of commercial and industrial construction in our principal markets  ii our ability to win project contracts  iii the amount and complexity of project changes requested by customers or general contractors  iv our success in utilizing our resources at or near full capacity  and v our ability to complete contracts on a timely and cost effective basis 
the level of commercial and industrial construction activity is related to several factors  including local  regional and national economic conditions  interest rates  availability of financing  and the supply of existing facilities relative to demand 
we believe that there is an ongoing trend in the steel fabrication and erection industry to design and build large  complex projects according to accelerated time schedules 
with many projects  only portions of the detail design drawings are completed when construction begins 
the remaining drawings are completed  with numerous design changes being implemented  throughout the construction process 
these fast track  design as you go projects are well suited to integrated contractors that can i reduce the logistical and coordination problems inherent in the use of multiple subcontractors to complete a large  complex project  and ii more efficiently respond to rapid and multiple design changes while minimizing project delays and cost overruns commonly associated with such changes 
the complexity and size of these projects require subcontractors possessing extended financial and operational capabilities 
individual large projects can have a substantial impact upon our results of operations and cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from quarter to quarter 
during and  we instituted new controls regarding the bidding and execution of large  complex projects that we believe help protect us against such significant quarter over quarter financial fluctuations 
these guidelines included modifications to our detailing and estimating procedures that we believe result in more timely visibility regarding the status of these projects as well as procedures to rectify errors or inconsistencies that could cause unrealized change orders 
we obtain contracts through competitive bidding or negotiation  which generally are either fixed price  cost plus or unit cost arrangements 
during  and  most of our revenues were derived from projects performed pursuant to fixed price contracts 
in bidding or negotiating contracts  we must estimate our costs  including projected increases in labor  material  and service costs 
project duration typically lasts from one to months 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon either the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours 
revenue recognition begins when progress is sufficient to estimate final results with reasonable accuracy 
revenues relating to changes in the scope of a contract are recognized when the customer has authorized the change  the work is commenced and we have made an estimate of the amount that will be paid for the change 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which revisions become known 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
cost of revenues consists of the costs of materials  equipment  direct labor  fringe benefits  and indirect costs associated with detailing  fabrication and erection  including rent  depreciation and supervisory labor 
other costs not associated with specific projects are included in general and administrative expenses 
gross profit margins can be positively and negatively affected by large  more complex projects  the percentage of negotiated contracts relative to competitively bid contracts  the number and scope of contract modifications  and improvements in operating efficiencies 
gross profit margins can be adversely affected by the competitive environment  construction delays  inefficient or underutilization of our resources  availability and cost of materials and labor  the timing and performance of work by other contractors  weather conditions and construction site conditions 
backlog increases as contract commitments  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders are obtained  decreases as revenues are recognized  and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work 
table of contents to be performed under the contract 
the timing of contract commitments  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders  the size of projects and other factors beyond our control can cause significant fluctuation in backlog outstanding at any given date 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data as a percentage of revenues years ended december revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses goodwill amortization operating income interest expense other income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of the aforementioned downturn in the commercial construction industry 
the average revenues for our largest revenue generating projects were million in versus million in this decrease was primarily due to one project in colorado that generated approximately million of revenue in but did not generate comparable of revenues in gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in due primarily to the decrease in revenues coupled with a decrease in gross profit percentage during the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased to in from in  primarily due to the aforementioned downturn in the commercial construction industry during the third and fourth quarters of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the decrease in legal fees and other professional fees and the million write off of capitalized costs associated with computer software developed for internal use in  offset by the million stock option buyout in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase was primarily a result of decreased revenues during general and administrative expenses include those for contract bids  estimating  sales and marketing  facilities  project management  and support services 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization was million for the years ended december  and goodwill amortization represents the amortization of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from the addison  quincy  six  and bannister business combinations 
the goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over years 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to our decreased use of our available lines of credit and 
table of contents the reduction of long term debt during interest expense is primarily attributable to our remaining million senior notes issued in june other income 
other income increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the  gain on the extinguishment of debt  the  gain on the sale of a long term investment  and additional interest income due to greater funds being available for investment in income tax expense 
income tax expense for was million which represents an effective tax rate of approximately compared to million in which represented a effective tax rate on earnings 
the effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rates primarily because of state income taxes and the amortization of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily due to the large impact of the nondeductibility of goodwill for tax purposes because of decreased income before taxes in net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income decreased by to million in from million in backlog 
backlog increased by to million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase in backlog compared to december  was primarily the result of the award of one large project under a notice to proceed to our pacific southwest segment 
of the backlog at december   approximately million was attributable to one project in arizona and approximately million was attributable to one project in california 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily a result of additional revenues generated by our pacific southwest segment from a greater number of projects 
the average revenues for our ten largest revenue generating projects were million in versus million in this increase was primarily due to one project in colorado that generated approximately million of revenue in gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in due primarily to the increase in revenues coupled with an increase in gross profit percentage 
approximately million of the increase was the result of the settlement with the arizona professional baseball team limited partnership received in the fourth quarter of as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in from in  primarily due to higher average margins achieved by our pacific southwest and southwest segments 
excluding the above settlement  gross profit would have been in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million in from million in  and to of revenues compared to of revenues in the increase in general and administrative expenses was largely attributable to the write off of capitalized costs associated with computer software developed for internal use  additional general and administrative costs required to support the revenue growth of the companies  the costs associated with our new joist manufacturing facility in buckeye  arizona and increased legal fees associated with the settlement of pending claims 
general and administrative expenses include those for contract bids  estimating  sales and marketing  facilities  project management  and support services 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization was million for the years ended december  and goodwill amortization represents the amortization of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from the addison  quincy  six  and bannister business combinations 
the goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over years 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in and million in the interest expense is primarily attributable to our million senior notes issued in june and our use of the available line of credit 

table of contents other income 
other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in other income was attributable primarily to a decrease in cash available for investment during the first three quarters of income tax expense 
income tax expense for was million which represents an effective tax rate of approximately compared to million in which represented a effective tax rate on earnings 
the effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rates primarily because of state income taxes and the amortization of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily due to a decrease in income tax credits recognized in which were attributable to qualifying research and experimentation expenses associated with our engineering  detailing and software development activities 
net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income increased by to million in from million in backlog 
backlog decreased by to million at december  compared to million at december  the million decrease in backlog compared to december  was the result of job mix based on selected targeted projects 
we have made an effort to focus on bidding a greater number of projects with shorter duration to maximize efficiencies and reduce risk 
of the backlog at december   approximately million was attributable to one project in arizona and approximately million was attributable to one project in florida 
liquidity and capital resources we attempt to structure the payment arrangements under our contracts to match costs incurred under the project 
to the extent we are able to bill in advance of costs incurred  we generate working capital through billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts 
to the extent we are not able to bill in advance of costs  we rely on our credit facilities to meet our working capital needs 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit  with approximately million available for borrowings see discussion on the following page of the amendment in the first quarter of  which reduced the credit line availability  and working capital of approximately million 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity through our present resources and the existence of our bank credit facility to meet our near term operating needs 
our short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations including receivables  inventories  and other costs incurred in performing our contracts 
operating activities provided cash flows of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   operating cash flows were more than net income primarily due to non cash charges of million related to depreciation and amortization and a million decrease in inventory  offset by a million increase in costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and a million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
for the year ended december   operating cash flows were more than net income primarily due to a million decrease in costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and a million increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  coupled with million of depreciation and amortization  and offset by other changes in working capital 
cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   including purchases of property and equipment of million in and million in financing activities required million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the credit facility is secured by a first priority  perfected security interest in all of our assets and our present and future subsidiaries 
we will be eligible for reductions in the interest rates on the credit facility if we achieve certain leverage ratio targets 
the interest rates  based on the leverage ratio achieved  can range from a minimum of libor plus to a maximum of libor plus 
at december   there was approximately million of credit available under the credit facility for borrowings  which has been reduced by approximately million of outstanding letters of credits under which we are committed 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain specified leverage ratios  interest coverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios and a specified minimum ebitda 
the credit facility also contains other covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions  change our business  merge  consolidate or dispose of material portions of our assets 
the security agreements pursuant to which our assets are pledged prohibit any further pledge of such assets without the written consent of the bank 
during the first quarter of  we amended our credit facility by modifying the fourth quarter covenant compliance and amending the current covenants due to our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the year new maximum levels were established for the leverage ratio covenant along with new minimum levels for ebitda and the fixed charge coverage ratio 
two additional covenants were added which restrict the revolver availability to million and prohibit any repurchase of the senior notes until the month ebitda exceeds million 
on june   we completed a private placement of million in principal amount of our senior notes due senior notes 
net proceeds of the senior notes were used to repay certain indebtedness and to pay the cash portions of the purchase price for our acquisitions of addison  quincy  six and bannister 
the senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  beginning in at a premium declining ratably to par by we may redeem up to of the senior notes at a premium with the proceeds of an equity offering  provided that at least of the aggregate amount of the senior notes originally outstanding remain outstanding 
the senior notes contain covenants that  among other things  provide limitations on additional indebtedness  sale of assets  change of control and dividend payments 
the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on a senior subordinated basis by our current and future  direct and indirect subsidiaries 
during  we repurchased million in principal amount of our senior notes at a discount on the open market 
we have no other long term debt commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 

table of contents we lease some of our fabrication and office facilities from a partnership in which our principal beneficial stockholders and their family members are the general and limited partners 
we have three leases with the partnership for our principal fabrication and office facilities  the property and equipment acquired in the acquisition of b k steel  and additional office facilities adjacent to our principal office and shop facilities 
each lease has a year term and is subject to increases every five years commencing in pursuant to a consumer price index formula 
our annual rental payments for the three leases were million in and each year thereafter during the remaining terms of the leases 
see item properties 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which includes improvements at two of our plants 
we are also considering the expansion of certain of our facilities and production capacities  which would increase the estimated capital expenditures 
we believe that our available funds  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital needs 
however  we may expand our operations through future acquisitions and may require additional equity or debt financing 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we will apply statement beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions of statement is expected to result in an increase in income before taxes of million in we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to complete the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the first quarter of based on preliminary steps we have taken to prepare for the adoption of statement  it is likely that a significant portion of the goodwill related to the southeastern  southwest and western segments will be impaired using the impairment test required by statement we currently evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the entity level unamortized balance of goodwill to projected undiscounted cash flows  which does not result in an indicated impairment 
an impairment that is required to be recognized when adopting statement will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of we have not yet determined the amount of the potential impairment loss  as statement requires a measurement date of january  we plan to complete the measurement of the impairment loss in the first quarter of factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
the following potential risks and uncertainties  together with those mentioned elsewhere herein  including in item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  could affect our future operating results  financial condition  and the market price of our common stock 
substantial leverage and ability to service debt with our senior notes and existing line of credit facility  we are highly leveraged with substantial debt service in addition to operating expenses and planned capital expenditures 
our senior notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness  subject to certain limitations  including additional secured indebtedness under existing credit facilities 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation  i a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations 
table of contents must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness  reducing the funds available for operations and for capital expenditures  including acquisitions  ii covenants contained in the senior notes or the credit facility or other credit facilities will require us to meet certain financial tests  and other restrictions will limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  including possible acquisition activities  iii our leveraged position will substantially increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  iv our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited and v our leveraged position and the various covenants contained in the senior notes and the credit facility may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic  industry and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the senior notes  to sell selected assets  or to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and growth or business strategies 
there can be no assurance that any such measures would be sufficient to enable us to service our debt  or that any of these measures could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
dependence on construction industry we earn virtually all of our revenues in the building construction industry  which is subject to local  regional and national economic cycles 
our revenues and cash flows depend to a significant degree on major construction projects in various industries  including the hotel and casino  retail shopping  health care  mining  computer chip manufacturing  public works and other industries  each of which industries may be adversely affected by general or specific economic conditions 
if construction activity declines significantly in our principal markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments 
fluctuating quarterly results of operations we have experienced  and in the future are expected to continue to experience  substantial variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in particular  our operating results may vary because of downturns in one or more segments of the building construction industry  changes in economic conditions  our failure to obtain  or delays in awards of  major projects  the cancellation of major projects  or our failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion 
in addition  from time to time we have disputes with our customers concerning change orders to our contracts 
to the extent such disputes are not resolved on a timely basis  our results of operations may be affected 
any of the foregoing factors could result in the periodic inefficient or underutilization of our resources and could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
revenue recognition estimates we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on either the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when we determine that a loss will be incurred 
we frequently review and revise revenues and total cost estimates as work progresses on a contract and as contracts are modified 
accordingly  revenue adjustments based upon the revised completion percentage are reflected in the period that estimates are revised 
although revenue estimates are based upon management assumptions supported by historical experience  these estimates could vary materially from actual results 
to the extent percentage of 
table of contents completion adjustments reduce previously reported revenues  we would recognize a charge against operating results  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the applicable period 
variations in backlog  dependence on large contracts our backlog can be significantly affected by the receipt  or loss  of individual contracts 
for example  approximately million  representing of our backlog at december   was attributable to five contracts  letters of intent  notices to proceed or purchase orders 
if one or more large contracts are terminated or their scope reduced  our backlog could decrease substantially 
our future business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to replace significant contracts when lost or completed  or if we otherwise fail to maintain a sufficient level of backlog 
in addition  if a project representing a significant portion of our backlog is delayed or otherwise postponed  our anticipated revenue from that project may not be realized until later than anticipated 
in particular  political and site selection considerations may cause a delay in constructing the arizona cardinals multipurpose facility  which currently accounts for million of our current backlog 
to the extent that political or other considerations delay this project  the recognition of revenue we anticipate from this project also will be delayed 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
fixed price contracts most of our million backlog at december  represented projects being performed on a fixed price basis 
in bidding on projects  we estimate our costs  including projected increases in costs of labor  material and services 
despite these estimates  costs and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract may vary from estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions  variations in labor and equipment productivity over the terms of contracts  higher than expected increases in labor or material costs and other factors 
these variations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of our operations for any period 
geographic concentration our fabrication and erection operations currently are conducted primarily in arizona  nevada  florida  georgia  california and texas  states in which the construction industry has experienced substantial growth during recent years 
because of this concentration  future construction activity and our business may be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in economic conditions existing in these states and in the southwestern and southeastern united states generally 
factors that may affect economic conditions include increases in interest rates or limitations in the availability of financing for construction projects  decreases in the amount of funds budgeted for governmental projects  decreases in capital expenditures devoted to the construction of plants  distribution centers  retail shopping centers  industrial facilities  hotels and casinos  convention centers and other facilities  the prevailing market prices of copper  gold and other metals that impact related mining activity  and downturns in occupancy rates  office space demand  tourism and convention related activity and population growth 
competition many small and various large companies offer fabrication  erection and related services that compete with those we provide 
local and regional companies offer competition in one or more of our geographic markets or product segments 
out of state or international companies may provide competition in any market 
we compete for every project we obtain 
although we believe customers consider  among other things  the availability and technical capabilities of equipment and personnel  efficiency  safety record and reputation  price competition usually is the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract 
competition has resulted in pressure on pricing and operating margins  and the effects of competitive pressure in the industry may continue 
some of our competitors have greater capital and other resources than ours and are more established in their respective markets 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase their commitment of resources devoted to competing aggressively with us or that we will be able to compete profitably with our competitors 

table of contents substantial liquidity requirements our operations require significant amounts of working capital to procure materials for contracts to be performed over relatively long periods  and for purchases and modifications of heavy duty and specialized fabrication equipment 
in addition  our contract arrangements with customers sometimes require us to provide payment and performance bonds and  in selected cases  letters of credit  to partially secure our obligations under our contracts  which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to receipt of payments 
furthermore  our customers often will retain a portion of amounts otherwise payable to us during the course of a project as a guarantee of completion of that project 
to the extent the we are unable to receive project payments in the early stages of a project  our cash flow would be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
capacity constraints  dependence on subcontractors we routinely rely on subcontractors to perform a significant portion of our fabrication  erection and project detailing to fulfill projects that we cannot fulfill in house due to capacity constraints or that are in markets in which we have not established a strong local presence 
with respect to these projects  our success depends on our ability to retain and successfully manage these subcontractors 
any difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified subcontractors on terms and conditions favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete these projects in a timely and cost effective manner 
dependence upon key personnel our success depends on the continued services of our senior management and key employees as well as our ability to attract additional members to our management team with experience in the steel fabrication and erection industry 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of our management or other key personnel  or our inability to attract new management when necessary  could have a material adverse effect upon our operations 
union contracts we currently are a party to a number of collective bargaining agreements with various unions representing some of our fabrication and erection employees 
these contracts expire or are subject to expiration at various times in the future 
our inability to renew such contracts could result in work stoppages and other labor disturbances  which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations 
no assurance of successful acquisitions in addition to acquisitions we made in of addison  quincy  six and bannister  we intend to consider acquisitions of and alliances with other companies in our industry that could complement our business  including the acquisition of entities in diverse geographic regions and entities offering greater access to industries and markets not currently served by us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or alliance candidates can be identified or  if identified  that we will be able to consummate such transactions 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any acquired companies into our existing operations  which could increase our operating expenses 
moreover  any acquisition by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as diverting attention of our management from other business concerns  our entrance into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisitions of addison  quincy  six  and bannister have consumed and will continue to consume substantial management attention and resources and will require substantial efforts and entail certain risks in the integration of their operations 
there can be no assurance that anticipated cost savings or synergies will be achieved 
we will be dependent on the retention and future performance of key officers and employees of addison  quincy  six  and bannister for day to day management and future operating results 

table of contents operating risks  litigation construction and heavy steel plate weldments involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  design  fabrication and erection errors and work environment accidents can cause death or personal injury  property damage and suspension of operations 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in loss of revenues  increased costs  and liability to third parties 
we are subject to litigation claims in the ordinary course of business  including lawsuits asserting substantial claims 
currently  we do not maintain any reserves for our ongoing litigation 
we periodically review the need to maintain a litigation reserve 
we maintain risk management  insurance  and safety programs intended to prevent or mitigate losses 
there can be no assurance that any of these programs will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
potential environmental liability our operations and properties are affected by numerous federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations  such as those governing discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
compliance with these laws and regulations has become increasingly stringent  complex and costly 
there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or their interpretation will not change in a manner that could materially and adversely affect our operations 
certain environmental laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and its state law counterparts  provide for strict and joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of spills and other releases of toxic and hazardous substances 
these laws may apply to conditions at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors  as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located 
although we have not incurred any material environmental related liability in the past and we believe that we are in material compliance with environmental laws  there can be no assurance that we  or entities for which we may be responsible  will not incur such liability in connection with the investigation and remediation of facilities we currently operate or formerly owned or operated or other locations in a manner that could materially and adversely affect our operations 
governmental regulation many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate  including regulations relating to occupational health and workplace safety  principally the occupational safety and health act and regulations thereunder 
in addition  we are subject to licensure and hold or have applied for licenses in each of the states in the united states in which we operate and in certain local jurisdictions within such states 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and permitting requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this status 
further  we cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing regulations 
risks of international operations we currently operate in selected international markets and are seeking to further expand our presence in these markets 
less than of our revenues in  however  were related to projects outside the united states 
our international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of war  nationalization of assets  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  changing political conditions  changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment  and overlap of different tax structures 
although we currently attempt to limit our exposure to currency fluctuations by dealing solely in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that our international operations will escape the risks of fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  or controls on currency exchange

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instrument during and  we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial or derivative commodity instruments 
primary market risk exposure we are potentially exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our initial million fixed rate senior notes  which were issued on june  specifically  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the remaining million senior notes 
at december   the fair value of the senior notes was approximately of par or million 
from january  to december   the senior notes had a fair value that was as low as of par and as high as of par 
the variation in fair value is a function of market interest rate changes and the investor perception of the investment quality of the senior notes
