mks was treated as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes prior to its initial public offering in mks s corporation status terminated upon the closing of the offering  at which time mks became subject to federal  and certain state  income taxation as a c corporation 
the pro forma net income reflects a pro forma effective tax rate of in to reflect federal and state income taxes which would have been payable had mks been taxed as a c corporation in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses mks consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  in process research and development  merger expenses  intangible assets and goodwill  inventories and investments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales generally upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
the company has no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
the company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
shipping and handling fees  if any  billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
the company monitors and tracks the amount of product returns and reduces revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while product returns and warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates and warranty repair costs that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the cost to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
the company makes estimates evaluating its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
in process research and development the company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions at fair value including in process research and development ipr d 
the company determines ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses ipr d when technical feasibility is not reached 
during  the company expensed approximately million in ipr d charges in connection with the on line acquisition because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
if the company acquires other companies with ipr d in the future  we will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technical feasibility 
merger expenses the company expenses fees and costs related to mergers accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
in connection with the acquisition of astex in january  the company expensed approximately million of merger related expenses  consisting of million of investment banking  legal  accounting  printing and other professional fees  and million of regulatory and other costs in the first quarter of in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
merger expenses associated with any future purchase business combination will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and included as part of the purchase price 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by the company s management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s business model 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
effective with the january  adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company will cease to amortize approximately  of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas on our financial position  cash flows and results of operations and expects to complete this review by the second quarter of inventory the company values its inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand for the next to months 
as demonstrated during  demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly 
the company recorded special charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the second quarter of the charges were significantly higher than normal and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for older technology products 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s product could result in a short term increase or decrease in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  the company s industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
investments the company holds investments in companies having operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to its strategic focus  which are in non publicly traded companies whose value is difficult to determine 
these investments are accounted for under the cost and equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent a to percent ownership of the equity securities of the investee  the company s proportionate share of the earnings or losses of the investee is included in other income and expense 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total net sales of certain line items included in mks consolidated statement of income data year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill impairment restructuring charge merger expenses purchase of in process technology income loss from operations interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss pro forma data historical income before income taxes pro forma provision for income taxes pro forma net income year ended compared to net sales net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales and million for the year ended december  or of net sales 
the decrease in net sales is due to a worldwide slowdown in demand for semiconductors during which resulted in a decline in demand for the company s products from the company s semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturer customers  offset by an increase in net sales of approximately million from the companies acquired in and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  gross margin was negatively effected by special charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the second quarter of these charges were significantly higher than normal and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand  including reduced demand for older technology products 
additionally  gross margin was negatively effected due to lower absorption of manufacturing overhead costs 
research and development mks research and development efforts are directed toward developing and improving mks process control instruments and components for semiconductor and advanced thin film processing applications and identifying and developing products for new applications for which gas management plays a critical role 
research and development expense increased to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased compensation expense resulting from the companies acquired in and the company s research and development efforts include numerous projects which generally have a duration of to months 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreased salaries and wages and incentive compensation expense of million  offset by increased professional fees of million primarily related to costs associated with defending certain of the company s patents 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets of million for the year ended december   represents the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisitions completed by the company  of which million relates to acquired intangibles and million relates to goodwill 
effective with the january  adoption of sfas  the company will cease to amortize approximately  of goodwill 
goodwill impairment charge when the company acquired the shamrock product line  it was expected that sales of the existing system design and development of new system designs would generate future revenues 
since the acquisition  the company has provided potential customers with purchase quotations for shamrock systems  including a significant quotation to a potential customer in january for the sale of several systems 
the customer did not purchase the systems  and the quotation expired in march the company has been unsuccessful in selling any systems of the product line since the acquisition and  with the expiration of the significant quote in march  the company evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets  primarily goodwill 
as a result  based on a discounted cash flow analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge for the carrying value of the related goodwill of approximately  in the quarter ended march  merger costs on january  mks completed its acquisition of astex in a transaction accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
under the pooling of interests method of accounting  fees and expenses related to the merger are expensed in the period of the merger 
during the year ended december   mks expensed approximately million of merger related expenses  consisting of million of investment banking  legal  accounting  printing and other professional fees  and million of regulatory and other costs 
purchase of in process technology in april  the company acquired on line in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for various projects  generally expected to have durations of to months  that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 
the company believes this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage of completion for in process projects acquired ranged from to  based on management s estimates of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the second quarter of interest income expense  net during the years ended december  and  the company generated net interest income of million and million  respectively  primarily from the invested net proceeds of its common stock offerings  offset by interest expense on outstanding debt 
interest income decreased by million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower interest rate yields on investments during other income expense  net other expense of million for the year ended december  represents a loss on sale of assets of million and a loss on the sale of an investment in a company of million 
other expense of million in the year ended december  represents expenses related to the preparation of the registration statement for the company s follow on public stock offering 
the company decided not to proceed with the follow on offering  and converted the registration statement to a shelf registration statement 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively  resulting in an income tax benefit of million and provision for income taxes of million  respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate and the resulting income tax benefit for the year ended december  as compared to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily due to non deductible charges associated with acquisitions made in year ended compared to net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales and million for the year ended december  or of net sales 
the increase in net sales was due to increased worldwide sales volume of the company s existing products which resulted primarily from increased sales to the company s semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer and semiconductor device manufacturer customers  and an increase of approximately million from the companies acquired in gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period of the increase was primarily due to fuller utilization of existing manufacturing capacity as a result of increased sales  other manufacturing efficiencies  and a lower fixed cost structure from restructurings in gross margins in fiscal were adversely impacted by a million inventory writedown 
research and development research and development expense increased to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the same period of the increase was due to increased compensation of million  increased spending for development materials related to projects in process of million  development of new products and increased spending on other costs related to development work 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the same period of the increase was due primarily to increased compensation expense of million  earnout payments of million related to the acquisition of spectra international  llc  increased professional fees and other selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the increase is due to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisitions completed by the company during purchase of in process technology in july  the company acquired spectra international  llc in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the in process technology projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the three months ended september  interest income expense  net during the years ended december  and  the company generated net interest income of million and million  respectively  primarily from the invested net proceeds of its common stock offerings  offset by interest expense on outstanding debt 
provision for income taxes prior to the closing of its initial public offering in april  mks was treated as an s corporation for tax purposes 
as an s corporation  mks was not subject to federal and certain state income taxes 
upon the closing of its initial public offering on april   mks status as an s corporation was terminated and it became subject to taxes as a c corporation 
the company s pro forma provision for income taxes in reflects the estimated tax expense the company would have incurred had it been subject to federal and state income taxes as a c corporation 
the pro forma provision differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the effects of state and foreign taxes and certain tax credits 
the provision for income taxes of is approximately the same as the pro forma provision in liquidity and capital resources mks has financed its operations and capital requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  long term real estate financing  capital lease financing and short term lines of credit

the company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  in thousands are as follows payment due by period less than total year years years after years debt     capital leases operating leases     mks believes that its working capital  together with the cash anticipated to be generated from operations and funds available from existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy its estimated working capital and planned capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
prior to its initial public offering  the company entered into a tax indemnification and s corporation distribution agreement with its then existing stockholders the pre ipo stockholders 
the agreement includes provisions for the payment  with interest  by the pre ipo stockholders or mks  as the case may be  for the difference between the million distributed as an estimate of the amount of the accumulated adjustments account as of april   which is the date the company s s corporation status was terminated  and the actual amount of the accumulated adjustments account on that day 
the actual amount of the accumulated adjustments account was million 
accordingly  the company made an additional distribution of million  plus interest of million  to the pre ipo stockholders during the three months ended september  the amount of the additional distribution payable had been estimated to be million 
this estimated amount was charged directly to retained earnings during and had no impact on net income or earnings per share 
the difference of million between the actual additional distribution and the estimated additional distribution was credited directly to retained earnings during the three months ended september  and had no impact on net income or earnings per share 
the amount of the accumulated adjustments account can be affected by future income tax audits of mks 
if any audit increases or decreases the accumulated adjustments account  mks or the pre ipo stockholders  as the case may be  will also be required to make a payment  with interest  of such difference to the other party 
no shareholders  other than the pre ipo stockholders  are parties to the tax indemnification and s corporation distribution agreement 
derivatives the company conducts its operations globally 
consequently the results of our operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales of inventory  over a maximum period of fifteen months  using forward exchange contracts and currency options primarily related to japanese and european currencies 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges  and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings  the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales 
as of december  the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings over the next twelve months is an unrealized gain of  net of taxes 
the ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to option premiums  is recorded in cost of sales  and was immaterial in realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased option contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in earnings 
the cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as investing activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling  and  to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
of such forward exchange contracts  and  to exchange japanese yen for us dollars were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
local currency purchased options with notional amounts totaling   and  to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars were outstanding at december   and  respectively 
there were no foreign exchange gains or losses on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify for hedge accounting in foreign exchange gains of  and  on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify for hedge accounting were recognized in earnings during and  respectively  and are classified in other income  net 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a gain of  and  and a loss of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fair values of forward exchange contracts at december   determined by applying period end currency exchange rates to the notional contract amounts  amounted to an unrealized gain of  the fair values of local currency purchased options at december  and  which were obtained through dealer quotes were immaterial 
the company hedges certain intercompany payables with currency options 
since these derivatives hedge existing amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies  the options do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the foreign exchange gain on these currency options was not material in  and interest rate risk management the company utilizes an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on certain variable rate term loans in order to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on earnings 
in  the company entered into a four year interest rate swap agreement  with a major bank  on a declining notional amount basis which matches with the scheduled variable term loan principal payments 
at december   the remaining notional amount of the interest rate swap  and the remaining principal amount of the bank term loan was  under the agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of on the notional amount and receives libor 
the interest differential payable or accruable on the swap agreement is recognized on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
the criteria used to apply hedge accounting for this interest rate swap is based upon management designating the swap as a hedge against the variable rate debt combined with the terms of the swap matching the underlying debt including the notional amount  the timing of the interest reset dates  the indices used and the paydates 
at december   the fair value of this interest rate swap  which represents the amount the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement  was not material  based on dealer quotes 
the variable rate received on the swap at december  was

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
upon adoption of sfas the company will cease to amortize approximately  of goodwill 
the impairment review will involve a two step process as follows step the company will compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  the company will move on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step the company will perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
the company will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess

in order to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on earnings  mks entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on its variable rate term loans 
under the swap agreement  mks pays a fixed rate of on the notional amount and receives libor 
at december  and  the notional amount of the interest rate swap was equal to the principal amount of the variable rate term loans 
the potential increase in the fair value of term loans resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  after adjusting for the interest rate swap  was not material 
due to its short term duration  the fair value of the company s cash and investment portfolio at december  and approximated its carrying value 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying values
