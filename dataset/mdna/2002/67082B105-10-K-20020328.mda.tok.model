oaot offers both customized and pre packaged solutions 
integration services are delivered on a consulting and project basis under both time and materials and fixed price arrangements  while our application management and software solutions are made available through an application support model or outsourced from the customer

in  the company s data center management contract with a strategic customer was renewed for ten years

there are also instances where an engagement has started on a time and materials basis and evolved to a fixed price basis  as the requirements became sufficiently defined 
the professional staffing services business is concentrated within one strategic customer  however  the company has expanded its customer base and will continue to focus on expanding its customer base in the future

the company considers revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy see note to the financial statements included in item of this form k for a full description of the company s accounting policies 
the company recognizes software revenue under the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
and sop no 

except as noted below  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon the customer s execution of a noncancelable license agreement and the company s delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable  and no customization of the software is required 
if customization of the software is required  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis over the period during which customization is performed generally six to twelve months 
revenues are recognized from pmpm software license arrangements monthly over the term of the arrangement 
as the healthcare industry and the needs of our customers become more complex  the number of license sales requiring customization could increase in the future 
the resulting shift to percentage of completion accounting could defer the company s ability to recognize revenue and profit in our healthcare it solutions segment in the short term 
the company plans to continue efforts to market its software solutions on a pmpm subscription basis 
the pay as you go feature of the pmpm model is attractive to customers concerned with managing cash flow and broadens the target market for our products 
in addition  the pmpm model provides a more consistent and predictable cash flow and revenue stream and could have a greater contract value than a perpetual license sale 
this effort to market our products on a pmpm basis could result in the deferral of revenue  profit and cash flow in our healthcare it solutions segment in the short term 
general overview the company has grown since its inception  with revenues increasing to million in  from million in revenues from the two largest strategic customers were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the largest strategic customer ibm accounted for and  and the second largest strategic customer compaq accounted for and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has diversified the types of services provided to its strategic customers and expanded the number of strategic customer business units to whom it provides services 
for the year ended december   oaot earned of its revenues from data center management services provided to strategic customers 
for the year ended december   the company earned of its revenues from data center management 
a decrease in revenues from or loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the early termination or non renewal of a strategic customer s contract by an end user customer could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
for the years ended december  and  approximately  and of the company s revenues  respectively  were derived from fixed price contracts 
certain of the company s fixed price contracts require the company to meet pre established levels of service  while achieving operating or managerial efficiencies during the course of the engagements 
profitability is generally lower during the early term of the engagements as the company invests in assuring a smooth start up and in attaining certain service levels prior to the implementation of productivity improvements 
upon completion of the initial performance phase  the company initiates activities to attempt to increase profitability through improved management practices and the establishment of new technical and operational methodologies 
engagements that involve new services to existing customers or services to new customers may also result in lower margins during the early term of the engagement 
the company has historically experienced margin improvements after the start up phase of its engagements 
in addition  operating results can be affected by the level of the company s investments in international and other business development activities 
the company believes that its business is not seasonal 
the company sells technology services and solutions predominantly to technology companies 
a significant portion of annual revenues  in and in  is recurring revenue under long term contracts and other annually renewable contracts that have historically been renewed year to year at relatively constant levels of revenue 
the company begins with backlog under long term contracts of approximately million  of which approximately million is not expected to be filled in backlog is expected to be realized over the next ten years 
however  the company s long term contracts generally have early termination provisions  which  if invoked by its customers  could have a significant adverse impact on the company s profitability  cash flow and backlog 
further  the company s business is subject to general economic conditions and economic conditions within the technology industry  which appear to have been softening  especially with the decline of dot 
com businesses 
while historically the it services industry has generally experienced labor shortages and wage inflation in excess of many other industries  the company s engagements have not been materially affected 
the company prices its services under these engagements on the basis of the historical cost of the outsourced function  managerial experience  and its assessment of evolving technical factors 
the company also enters into professional services engagements requiring high demand it specialists for terms ranging up to months  usually on a time and materials basis 
as general economic conditions have weakened in the past year  the trend in the it industry has shifted from a shortage of labor to a surplus of labor 
the company is subject to the same general industry pricing pressures  required efficiency improvements and labor pressures inherent in the it services industry when performing engagements 
as a result  the company has experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressure  especially from strategic customers 
the company expects to be able to partially pass along any price reductions to its suppliers 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract  hire and retain personnel who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to meet the service requirements of its clients 
in pricing its services under shorter term engagements  the company evaluates the existing labor market for it specialists and the expected duration of the engagement

revenues from application solutions increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in revenues was due primarily to increased activity in the application support and application management businesses attributable to a full year of activity on a project that began in and activity under a new contract in this activity resulted in an increase in billable headcount by to a total of in it is anticipated that this business will continue to have a favorable impact with headcount expected to increase through may however  new contracts will have to be won for headcount to continue to increase 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in application development integration revenue as a result of fewer active projects  particularly in software implementation services 
revenues from it infrastructure solutions decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this decline is primarily due to decreases in network and desktop management services and professional staffing services revenues 
the decline in network and desktop management services revenues was due to in sourcing of services by one customer  and lower pricing and service levels under its current contract requirements 
the decrease in professional staffing services revenues is due to continued softness in staffing requisitions from a strategic customer and by the decline in it staff requisitions as a result of the slow down in the technology market 
this softness is expected to continue into future periods 
additionally  the professional staffing services line has experienced and expects to continue to experience pricing pressure from a strategic customer due to an excess supply of it professionals  which is expected to be partially passed through to the company s suppliers 
the company is diversifying its customer base in its managed it solutions segment  which is expected to partially mitigate reliance on strategic customers and diversify services 
revenues from the healthcare it solutions segment increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of mc perpetual license sales in and the ez cap acquisition

the increases in application solutions direct costs reflect the overall increase in business activity in the segment 
excluding the write down of million  the application solutions division gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the improvement in profitability is the result of a more favorable mix in billable to non billable headcount  and an overall increase in billable headcount from in december to in december in the application support and application management businesses 
the decrease in direct costs in it infrastructure solutions reflects the overall decrease in activity in the division as well as improvements in the management of direct labor expenses and savings from the reduction of overhead personnel

increased profitability is due to an increase in mc perpetual license sales in selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses sga were million and million or and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in sga is the result of increases in both the managed it solutions and healthcare it solutions segments

also affecting the increase in sga  for the year ended december   was an increase in bonus accrued under a management incentive plan and an increase in bad debt expense
