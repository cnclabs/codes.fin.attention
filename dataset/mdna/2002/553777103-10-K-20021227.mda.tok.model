revenue recognition in financial statements in fiscal the cumulative effect adjustment of the change in accounting for all periods through september  was a reduction in net income of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  which has been accounted for as a change to the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal during the fiscal years ended september  and september  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of revenues  which were previously recognized prior to the company s adoption of sab for orders that are manufactured and delivered in less than twelve months with routine installations and no special acceptance protocol  revenue is recognized when systems are shipped and title has passed to the customer  less the portion of related revenues associated with installation  which is deferred until customer acceptance 
the remaining revenue on these contracts is recognized upon installation and customer acceptance 
in cases where special acceptance protocols exist  the company recognizes revenue upon the completion of installation and fulfillment of obligations specific to the terms of the customer s contract 
revenue on contracts requiring longer delivery periods long term contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the cost incurred to date relative to estimated total cost of the contract 
in most cases  orders with complex installations and or unusual acceptance protocols involve long term contracts for custom systems that follow the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition through customer acceptance 
the company enters into long term contracts for customized equipment sold to its customers 
under the terms of such contracts  revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method may not be invoiced until completion of contractual milestones  upon shipment of the equipment  or upon installation and acceptance by the customer 
unbilled amounts for these contracts appear in the consolidated balance sheets as unbilled contracts and retainage receivable

the negative trend over the last two years is the result of continued weakness in the north american economy and a more recent softening in japan 
at this time  the company does not anticipate a significant change in these economies in the near term 
in the company received three orders from customers that were in excess of million compared to one million order in and one million order in  all of which were customers of the mechanical testing and simulation mt s segment 
orders for the mt s segment totaled million in  an increase of million or  compared to customer orders of million for the mt s segment booked of total company orders in  compared to for and in during  the company continued to experience strong order demand worldwide for motor sports and geological and civil structure products within the advanced systems business unit and within the material testing business unit  partially offset by the continuing slowdown in the global automotive markets 
the automotive market was particularly weak in japan and the rest of the asia pacific region  which was partially offset by a modest increase in europe 
the other mt s businesses experienced a similar geographic impact with soft north american demand and growth in europe that was offset by a decline in asia pacific 
the growth in europe is primarily due to continued demand for motor sports products 
generally  orders from customers in all geographies during were down slightly for each of the business units comprising the mt s segment when compared to new orders for the factory automation fa segment totaled million for  a decrease of million  or  compared to new orders during of million 
customer orders in this segment were particularly weak during fiscal  driven by aggressive cut backs in capital spending and manufacturing output in the north american automotive market and a significant drop in north american and european demand for the company s automation components in the semiconductor  electronic assembly and industrial markets 
this was the second year of depressed orders in the fa segment 
this segment accounted for of total company orders during fiscal  compared to and in and  respectively 
during fiscal  the fa segment experienced a decline in orders growth worldwide for industrial automation applications servo motors  amplifiers and motion controllers  and industrial sensors and automation components 
new orders in reflected strong industrial segment growth with a significant influence from the telecom market in europe 
on a geographic basis  orders from customers located in north america totaled million during  down million or compared to orders received of million in north american orders received during fiscal totaled million 
international orders received during of million increased by million  or  compared to orders received during of million 
international orders in fiscal totaled million 
the backlog of undelivered orders at september  totaled million  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to backlog of million at september  the increase in backlog is attributable to a change in business mix that resulted from an increase in long cycle versus short cycle orders in the strong order trend in the advanced systems and the material testing business units account for the majority of the increase in backlog 
backlog at the end of fiscal totaled million 
we believe that backlog is not an absolute indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog could be cancelled at the customers discretion 
net revenue expressed in thousands restated total    net revenue of million for fiscal decreased million or  compared to million for fiscal net revenue for fiscal totaled million 
on a segment basis  net revenue for the mt s segment in totaled million  comparing unfavorably to revenue of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in revenue for fiscal was principally driven by the decline in capital spending worldwide which was partially offset by the growth in the advanced systems and materials testing businesses 
the shorter cycle business units  particularly those related to the automotive industry  experienced the largest decline in revenue 
net revenue in the fa segment totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net revenue in the fa segment during was negatively impacted by world wide economic factors which resulted in a significant drop in demand

gross profit expressed in thousands restated gross profit    of net revenue gross profit  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to in  compared to in and in gross profit for the mt s segment was in fiscal  up substantially from in and in  while the gross profit of the fa segment declined to  compared to in and in gross profit in the mt s segment increased during despite continued competitive pricing pressures and was the result of a number of factors  including a favorable mix of aerospace and material testing business shipped during the year  better overall project management and the positive impact of headcount reductions 
cost containment and productivity initiatives have led to two successive years of gross profit improvement in the mt s segment 
the reduction in the fa segment s manufacturing and shipping volumes during fiscal negatively impacted the gross profit rate by percentage points 
the decline in business volume during drove a similar reduction in the fa segment when compared to selling  general  and administrative expenses expressed in thousands restated selling    general administrative    total    of net revenue selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net revenue  have been relatively flat for the past three years

spending in the fa segment in was reduced to million from million in and was relatively flat compared to the spending level of million 
during the segment focused on cost control activities which balanced discretionary spending against market opportunities which had the greatest possibility for profitable return 
the segment has also completed several initiatives begun during the past three fiscal years associated with site reductions and the centralization of core administrative functions

during  approximately of r d spending was in the mt s segment  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal and the overall decrease in r d spending  as a percentage of net revenue over the three year period  is primarily due to management initiatives to focus its spending on developments that have the greatest market potential and the highest return opportunity 
as a result of these initiatives and management s planned cutback in spending due to the decline in net revenue  r d spending  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in fiscal  compared to in and in interest income expense expressed in thousands interest expense    interest income   interest expense of million in  a decrease of million compared to fiscal  primarily resulted from lower average borrowings during and generally lower interest rates on its short term borrowings under its bank line of credit

for further information  see note to consolidated financial statements 
income from operations of the mt s segment increased to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of an improved gross profit rate of percentage points and management s cost containment initiatives 
income from operations of the mt s segment totaled million in the increase in operating income in was the result of improvements in the project management of large  complex custom projects  favorable mix in the advanced systems business unit  and the benefit of cost productivity initiatives 
the significant increase in operating income from to was due to issues experienced in that did not reoccur in these included technical difficulties in several large  complex custom projects and contract losses in the entertainment market  which resulted in a point increase in gross margin as a percent of net revenue 
loss from operations of the fa segment increased to a loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in primarily due to the impact of a decline in volume on the factory and fixed overhead cost absorption 
income from operations of the fa segment totaled million in the million decline from to was primarily due to a million write down of slow moving and obsolete inventory 
the decrease in income from operations from to was also driven by a reduction in gross margin associated with volume which was partially offset by an investment in sg a expenses during which were made in an anticipation of accelerated revenue growth

goodwill and other intangible assets increased to million per diluted share  from million per diluted share in and million per diluted share in changes in foreign currency exchange rates the company conducts business in countries outside the united states and is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that can affect its operating results and financial condition 
to minimize the risk  the company manages exposure to changes in foreign currency rates  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  principally forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the company s overall exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  since the gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
historically  approximately of the company s net revenue occurs from shipments to customers outside of the united states and about of this revenue approximately of the company s total net revenue is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies decreases the foreign currency denominated revenue and earnings when they are translated into us dollars 
conversely  weakening of the us dollar has the reverse impact on revenue and earnings 
during the past three years  the us dollar was generally stronger against other major currencies 
during this period the dollar gained approximately against the yen and against the euro 
gains and losses attributed to translating the financial statements for all non us subsidiaries are included in the currency translation adjustments 
the gains and losses on forward exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures are included as part of other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

the change in shareholders investment during was primarily the result of profitable operating results  funds received of million from the exercise of employee stock options and employee purchases of the company s stock under its stock purchase plan 
this increase was offset  in part  by the payment of cash dividends of million and repurchases of the company s stock totaling million 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities provided cash of million during  compared to million generated in and million generated in the increase in cash during resulted primarily from the impact of a decline in net revenue  which tends to reduce investment in operating activities  and a company focus on working capital

during  the company used cash of million in its financing activities primarily as the result of the net repayment of interest bearing debt of million  increased borrowings of million  cash dividends of million  and repurchasing million of its common stock 
this was partially offset by funds received in connection with employees exercise of stock options and stock purchases 
during  the company used cash flow of million on its financing activities  which reflected the payment of dividends of million and the repurchase of stock of million 
this use of funds in was nearly offset by the increase in both notes payable of million and net long term debt of million and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
overall cash flow has significantly improved from due to the company s focus on working capital and other elements of cash consumed in operating activities 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased by million

quarterly financial information revenue and operating results  as reflected on a quarterly basis  do not necessarily reflect changes in the demand for the company s products or its operating efficiency 
revenue and operating results in any quarter can be significantly affected by customer shipment and or installation timing or the timing of the completion of one or more high value systems where revenue is recognized upon shipment or customer acceptance rather than on the percentage of completion accounting method 
the company s use of the percentage of completion revenue recognition method for large  longer term projects generally has the effect of smoothing out significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter
