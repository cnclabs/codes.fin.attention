the largest component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average interest earning assets represents the company s net interest margin

the previous table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information related to the company s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from the daily balances throughout the periods indicated 
analysis of changes in net interest income

interest sensitivity 
the company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income 
the principal monitoring technique employed by the company is the measurement of the company s interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity at december  interest sensitivity analysis greater after one after three than one within through through within year or december  one three twelve one non dollars in thousands month months months year sensitive total assets earning assets loans       securities     federal funds sold and other total earning assets       liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits    savings deposits    time deposits       total interest bearing deposits       other short term borrowings    federal home loan bank advances   obligations under capital leases total interest bearing liabilities       period gap      cumulative gap      ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans 
the above table reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their repricing or maturity dates 
overnight federal funds are reflected at the earliest pricing interval due to the immediately available nature of the instruments 
debt securities are reflected at each instrument s ultimate maturity date 
scheduled payment amounts of fixed rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date 
scheduled payment amounts of variable rate amortizing loans are reflected at each scheduled payment date until the loan may be repriced contractually  the unamortized balance is reflected at that point 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period due to contractual arrangements which give the company the opportunity to vary the rates paid on those deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
fixed rate time deposits  principally certificates of deposit  are reflected at their contractual maturity date 
other short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
federal funds purchased are reflected at the earliest pricing interval since funds can be repriced daily 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the maturity date of each repurchase agreement which generally matures within one day 
advances from the federal home loan bank are reflected at their contractual maturity dates 
obligations under capital leases are reflected at each payment date 
the company generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap position and generally would benefit from decreasing market rates of interest when it is liability sensitive 
the company is liability sensitive within the one year period 
however  the company s gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
accordingly  management believes a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of the company s true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision and allowance for loan losses general 
the company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a quarterly basis  the company s board of directors reviews and approves the appropriate level for capitalbank s allowance for loan losses based upon management s recommendations  the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets  and a review of historical statistical data for both the company and other financial institutions 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on the company s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s allowance for loan losses is based upon judgments and assumptions of risk elements in the portfolio  future economic conditions  and other factors affecting borrowers 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant problem credits 
in addition  management monitors the overall portfolio quality through observable trends in delinquency  chargeoffs  and general and economic conditions in the service area 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the effectiveness of the company s monitoring and analysis system are also reviewed periodically by the banking regulators and the company s independent auditors 
based on present information and an ongoing evaluation  management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to meet presently known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that chargeoffs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
the company does not allocate the allowance for loan losses to specific categories of loans but evaluates the adequacy on an overall portfolio basis utilizing a risk grading system 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses and the composition of chargeoffs and recoveries for each of the last five years 
allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of period      average loans outstanding      balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period     allowance for loan losses from acquisitions loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage consumer total loan losses   recoveries of previous loan losses commercial and industrial real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net loan losses  provision for loan losses    balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period      allowance for loan losses to period end loans net chargeoffs to average loans nonperforming assets

nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans    restructured or impaired loans total nonperforming loans    other real estate owned total nonperforming assets    loans days or more past due and still accruing interest nonperforming assets to period end loans accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from current earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or chargeoff of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to earnings 
for all periods presented  the additional interest income  which would have been recognized into earnings if the company s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  is immaterial 
total nonperforming assets increased to million at december   from  at december  this amount consists primarily of nonaccrual loans which totaled million at december  nonperforming assets were of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december  potential problem loans 
at december   through its internal review mechanisms  the company had identified million of criticized loans and million of classified loans 
the results of this internal review process are the primary determining factor in management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company s criticized loans increased from million at december  to million at december  total classified loans increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in criticized and classified loans is attributable to the overall decline of the economy 
management is committed to addressing potential problem loans 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
noninterest income increased million  or  to million in from million in  which was primarily attributable to the gain recognized on the sale of the five branches in the premium on this sale totaled million

in  the amount of nontaxable income from securities offset the majority of income before taxes 
earning assets loans 
loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans were million compared to million at december  the decrease in loans during was primarily due to the sale of the five branches

at december   this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in the company s market areas to obtain a security interest in real estate  whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
real estate construction loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential mortgage loans  which is the largest category of the company s loans  increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  residential real estate loans consist of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
nonresidential mortgage loans  which include commercial loans and other loans secured by multi family properties and farmland  decreased  or  to million at december   from million at december  the overall increase in real estate lending was attributable to the continued demand for residential and commercial real estate loans in our markets 
the bank has been able to compete favorably for residential mortgage loans with other financial institutions by offering fixed rate products having three and five year call provisions 
commercial and industrial loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  consumer loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the company s loan portfolio reflects the diversity of its markets 
the company s twelve branches are located from the northern midlands of south carolina through the upstate 
primary market areas include anderson  belton  clemson  greenwood  newberry and saluda 
the economies of these markets are varied and represent different industries including medium and light manufacturing  higher education  regional health care  and distribution facilities 
these areas are expected to remain stable with continual growth 
the diversity of the economy creates opportunities for all types of lending 
the company does not engage in foreign lending 
the repayment of loans in the loan portfolio as they mature is also a source of liquidity for the company 
the following table sets forth the company s loans maturing within specified intervals at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates december  over one year one year or through over five dollars in thousands less five years years total commercial and industrial    real estate     consumer and other     loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates  floating interest rates the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio shown in the above table

large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  the company does not solicit brokered deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of short term borrowings and advances from the federal home loan bank 
short term borrowings are primarily federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
average short term borrowings were million in  a decrease of million from federal funds purchased from correspondent banks averaged million in at december   federal funds purchased totaled million 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged million in at december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million 
average federal home loan bank advances during were million compared to million during  a decrease of  advances from the federal home loan bank are collateralized by one to four family residential mortgage loans and the company s investment in federal home loan bank stock 
at december   borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million compared to million a year earlier 
although management expects to continue using short term borrowing and federal home loan bank advances as secondary funding sources  core deposits will continue to be the company s primary funding source 
of the million advances from the federal home loan bank outstanding at december    mature in   mature in   mature in   in  and  in capital the federal reserve board and bank regulatory agencies require bank holding companies and financial institutions to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off balance sheet exposures  adjusted for risk weights ranging from to 
under the risk based standard  capital is classified into two tiers 
tier capital of the company consists of common shareholders equity  excluding the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities  minus intangible assets 
the company s tier capital consists of the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
a bank holding company s qualifying capital base for purposes of its risk based capital ratio consists of the sum of its tier and tier capital 
the regulatory minimum requirements are for tier and for total risk based capital 
the holding company and capitalbank are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on average total assets as defined  which is known as the leverage ratio 
only the strongest bank holding companies and banks are allowed to maintain capital at the minimum requirement of 
all others are subject to maintaining ratios to above the minimum 
the company and capitalbank exceeded the federal reserve s fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december   and  as set forth in the following table

liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
the company s loans to assets ratio and loans to funds ratio increased from to the loans to assets ratio at december  was compared to at december   and the loans to funds ratio at december  was compared to at december  the amount of advances from the federal home loan bank were approximately million at december  compared to million at december  management expects to continue using these advances as a source of funding 
additionally  the company had approximately million of unused lines of credit for federal funds purchases and million of securities available for sale at december  as sources of liquidity 
the company depends on dividends from capitalbank as its primary source of liquidity 
the ability of capitalbank to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions which may  but are not expected to  have a material impact on the liquidity available to the company 
the company paid stock dividends in september  june and may and may do so in the future 
the company paid cash dividends in september  december and has declared a cash dividend for march accounting rule changes in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method 
the statement also requires that intangible assets be reported separately from goodwill 
this statement is effective for all transactions initiated after june  under sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  however  it should be evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis and adjusted to its fair value 
in addition  an acquired intangible should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  regardless of intent to do so 
however  the fasb recommends that financial institutions continue to follow the basic guidelines of sfas in recording and amortizing goodwill and other unidentifiable intangible assets 
the company adopted sfas on july  sfas is effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to adopt sfas on january  the adoption of these statements will not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which as amended by sfas and sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on how the derivative is used and how the derivative is designated 
the company adopted sfas on january  the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements since the company did not have any derivative instruments nor any derivative instruments embedded in other contracts in impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and its subsidiary are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
impact of off balance sheet instruments the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer at predetermined interest rates as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument 
since certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee a customer s performance to a third party and have essentially the same credit risk as other lending facilities 
standby letters of credit often expire without being used 
the company uses the same credit underwriting procedures for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as we do for our on balance sheet instruments 
the credit worthiness of each borrower is evaluated and the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary  is based on the credit evaluation 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
the company is not involved in off balance sheet contractual relationships  other than those disclosed in this report  that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or that could significantly impact earnings 
as of december  our commitments to extend credit totaled  and our standby letters of credit totaled  management believes that through various sources of liquidity  we have the necessary resources to meet obligations arising from these financial commitments 
our experience has been that a significant portion of these commitments often expire without being used 
industry developments on november   the us senate and house of representatives each passed the gramm leach bliley act  previously known as the financial services modernization act of the act was signed into law by president clinton in november among other things  the act repeals the restrictions on banks affiliating with securities firms contained in sections and of the glass steagall act 
the act also creates a new financial holding company under the bank holding company act  which will permit holding companies to engage in a statutorily provided list of financial activities  including insurance and securities underwriting and agency activities  merchant banking  and insurance company portfolio investment activities 
the act also authorizes activities that are complementary to financial activities 
the act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  the act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies 
in fact  it is not possible to predict the full effect that the act will have on the company 
from time to time  various bills are introduced in the united states congress with respect to the regulation of financial institutions 
certain of these proposals  if adopted  could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial services industry 
the company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  how these proposals would affect the company
