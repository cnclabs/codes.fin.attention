item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general over the last several years  we have emphasized adding reserves through drilling activity 
we also add reserves through strategic purchases of producing properties when oil and gas prices are at lower levels and other market conditions are appropriate 
during the past three years  we have used this flexible strategy of employing both drilling and acquisitions to add more reserves than we have depleted through production 
proved oil and gas reserves 
at year end  our total proved reserves were bcfe with a pv value of million 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
from to  our proved natural gas reserves increased by bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased by mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of bcfe  or 
we added reserves from to through both our drilling activity and through purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand of proved reserves in  bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in  and bcfe in through acquisitions we added bcfe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end while our total proved reserves quantities increased by during  the pv value of those reserves decreased  due to much lower prices at year end than at year end between those two year ends  there was a decrease in natural gas prices and a decrease in oil prices 
this decrease in prices resulted in bcfe of downward reserve revisions  solely attributed to the decrease in prices at year end gas prices were per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices were per bbl at year end  compared to a year earlier 
under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
the year end gas price of was significantly lower than the average gas price of we received during the year end oil price of per barrel was also lower than the average oil price of we received in had year end reserves been calculated using the average prices we received  for oil and for gas  the pv value would have been approximately million compared to the million reported using year end prices 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
the cost of unproved properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly  on a country by country basis  to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining whether such costs should be impaired  our management evaluates  among other factors  current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  international economic conditions  capital availability  foreign currency exchange rates  the political stability in the countries in which we have an investment  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
to the extent costs accumulate in countries where there are no proved reserves  any costs determined by management to be impaired are charged to income 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis for those countries with proved reserves 
the calculation of the ceiling test is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in  as a result of low oil and gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our domestic properties 
we had no write down on our new zealand properties 
in addition  any unsuccessful exploratory well costs in countries in which there are no proved reserves are charged to expense as incurred 
during the second quarter of  we charged to income as additional depreciation  depletion  and amortization costs our portion of drilling costs associated with an unsuccessful exploratory well drilled by another operator in new zealand 
this charge was  because of the delineation of our rimu discovery with two successful delineation wells drilled in  proved reserves were recognized in new zealand as of december  given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly  even if only for a short period  it is possible that additional write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
price risk management activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statements and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 was adopted by us on january  we have a policy to use derivative instruments  mainly the buying of protection price floors  to protect against price declines in oil and gas prices 
we elected not to designate our price floors for special hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 as amended 
however  we have elected to use mark to market accounting treatment for our derivative contracts 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a net of taxes charge of  which is recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during we recognized net gains of  relating to our derivative activities  with  in unrealized losses at year end this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   we had open price floor contracts covering notional volumes of million mmbtu of natural gas 
these natural gas price floor contracts relate to the nymex contract months of february and march at an average price of per mmbtu 
the fair value of our open price floor contracts at december   totaled  and is included in other current assets on the accompanying balance sheet 
related party transactions we are the operator of a number of properties owned by our affiliated limited partnerships and joint ventures and  accordingly  charge these entities and third party joint interest owners operating fees 
the operating fees charged to the partnerships in   and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
we are also reimbursed for direct  administrative  and overhead costs incurred in conducting the business of the limited partnerships  which totaled approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
in partnerships in which the limited partners have voted to sell their remaining properties and liquidate their limited partnerships  we are also reimbursed for direct  administrative  and overhead costs incurred in the disposition of such properties  which costs totaled approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next four years and thereafter are as follows thereafter total non cancelable operating lease commitments      senior notes due august   credit facility which expires in october   the repayment of the credit facility is based upon the balance at december  the amount borrowed under this facility has increased from year end levels 
this amount excludes million of a standby letter of credit issued under this facility 
liquidity and capital resources during  we relied both upon internally generated cash flows of million and million of additional borrowings from our bank credit facility to fund capital expenditures of million 
during  we primarily used internally generated cash flows of million to fund capital expenditures of million  along with the remaining net proceeds from our third quarter issuance of senior notes and common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities 
in  net cash provided by our operating activities increased by to million  as compared to million in and million in the increase of million was primarily due to reductions in working capital as oil and gas sales receivables decreased in along with a reduction in interest expense of million 
these increases in cash flow were offset by an million reduction of oil and gas sales  a million increase in oil and gas production costs  and a million increase in general and administrative expense 
the increase of million was primarily due to million of additional oil and gas sales  partially offset by million of increases in oil and gas production costs and interest expense 
existing credit facilities 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
our credit facility at year end consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
the borrowing base is redetermined at least every six months 
our revolving credit facility includes  among other restrictions  requirements as to maintenance of certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to working capital  debt  and equity ratios and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
the credit facility extends until october at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this facility 
subsequent to december   upon the closing of the new zealand tawn acquisition  the credit facility was increased to million and the borrowing base became million 
working capital 
our working capital decreased from a deficit of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the decrease was primarily due to reductions in oil and gas sales receivables  as oil and gas prices were lower at year end  and an increase in payables to partnerships related to december oil and gas property sales 
capital expenditures 
in  our capital expenditures of approximately million included domestic activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling  o million  or  for producing properties acquisitions  with approximately million spent on the lake washington acquisition and the remainder for the purchase of property interests from partnerships managed by us  o million  or  on exploratory drilling  o million  or  on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million  or less than  for fixed assets  o million on field compression facilities  and o million on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas 
new zealand activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling to further delineate the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on the rimu production station  o million  or  for exploratory drilling in the rimu and kauri areas  o million  or  on prospect costs  principally seismic and geological costs  o million  or less than  on producing properties acquisition evaluation costs related to our tawn acquisition  and o million for fixed assets  principally computers and office furniture and fixtures 
in  we participated in drilling development wells and exploratory wells  of which development wells and six exploratory wells were successes 
four of the development wells were drilled in new zealand to delineate the rimu and kauri areas  two of which were successful 
two of the exploratory wells were drilled in new zealnad  one unsuccessful and one was temporarily abandoned 
of our million of unproved property costs  million relates to our inventory of developmental and exploratory acreage to sustain drilling activity for future growth  while the remaining million pertains to the rimu production station which will be reclassified to proved properties once it comes on line near the end of the first quarter of capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
approximately million of the budget is allocated to domestic drilling  primarily in the lake washington area 
in new zealand  approximately million of the budget is allocated to drilling  with another million expected to be spent primarily for production facilities 
in  we anticipate drilling development wells and exploratory wells domestically  along with six development wells and one exploratory well in new zealand 
approximately million is targeted towards producing property acquisitions  the majority for the tawn properties in new zealand that closed in january of the remainder million will be used primarily for domestic leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  and million is budgeted for such costs in new zealand 
this million budget also excludes any producing property acquisitions that may arise in this low price environment and also excludes any property sales 
although we expect our total production to incrase by to over due to the focus of our budget in the lake washington area and in new zealand  we expect production to decline in our other core areas as no new drilling is currently budgeted to offset their natural production decline 
we believe that the anticipated internally generated cash flows for  together with bank borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to finance the costs associated with our currently budgeted capital expenditures 
should other producing property acquisitions activity become attractive in the current environment  the company would intend to explore the use of debt and or equity offerings to fund such activity 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in during  we used internally generated cash flows of million to fund capital expenditures of million 
during  we primarily used internally generated cash flows of million to fund capital expenditures of million  along with part of the remaining net proceeds from our third quarter issuance of senior notes and common stock 
our capital expenditures in included domestic activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling  o million  or  for producing properties acquisitions  approximately half of which was for the purchase of property interests from partnerships managed by us  with the other half purchased from a third party  o million  or  on domestic prospect costs  principally leasehold  seismic  and geological costs  o million  or  on exploratory drilling  o million  or  for fixed assets  o million  or less than  on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas  and o million on field compression facilities 
new zealand activities of million as follows o million  or  on developmental drilling to further delineate the rimu area  o million  or  on prospect costs  principally seismic and geological costs  o million  or  for exploratory drilling  o million  or  on the initial stages of production facilities  and o million  or less than  for fixed assets  principally a field office and warehouse 
in  we participated in drilling development wells and nine exploratory wells  of which development wells and five exploratory wells were successes 
two of the exploratory wells were drilled in new zealand to delineate the rimu area  both of which were successful 
subsequent events tawn acquisition 
through our subsidiary  swift energy new zealand limited  we acquired southern petroleum exploration limited southern nz in january for approximately million in cash 
southern nz was an affiliate of shell new zealand and owns interests in four onshore producing oil and gas fields  hydrocarbon processing facilities  and pipelines connecting the fields and facilities to export terminals and markets 
as of december   the reserves associated with this acquisition were estimated to be approximately bcfe  all of which were proved developed 
this acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
upon the closing of this acquisition  our credit facility was increased to million  and the borrowing base became million 
in conjunction with the tawn acquisition  we granted shell new zealand a short term option to acquire an undivided interest in our permit  which includes our rimu and kauri areas  as well as a interest in our rimu production station 
we do not know if shell new zealand will exercise this option 
the option would be subject to numerous notifications  governmental approvals and consents if exercised 
if the option is exercised  our credit facility would be reduced to million and our borrowing base would be million 
antrim acquisition 
we purchased through our subsidiary  swift energy new zealand limited  all of the new zealand assets owned by antrim oil and gas limited for  shares of swift energy company common stock 
antrim owned a interest in permit and a interest in permit as of december   the reserves associated with this acquisition were estimated to be approximately bcfe 
this transaction closed in march results of operations revenues 
our revenues in decreased by compared to revenues in due primarily to decreases in oil prices 
oil and gas sales revenues in decreased by  or million  from the level of those revenues for even though our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average prices received for oil decreased to per bbl in from per bbl in average gas prices received decreased slightly to per mcf in from per mcf in in  our million decrease in oil and gas sales resulted from o price variances that had a million unfavorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the decrease in average oil prices received and million was attributable to the slight decrease in average gas prices received  and o volume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with million of increases coming from the  bbl increase in oil sales volumes  offset somewhat by a decrease of million from the bcf decrease in gas sales volumes 
revenues in increased by compared to revenues 
in  oil and gas sales revenues increased by  or million  over those revenues in in  net sales volumes decreased by  or bcfe  compared to net sales volumes in average oil prices received went from per bbl in to per bbl in  and average gas prices received increased from per mcf in to per mcf in in  our million increase in oil and gas sales resulted from o price variances that had an million favorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the increase in average oil prices received and million was attributable to the increase in average gas prices received  and o volume variances that had a million unfavorable impact on sales  with million of decreases coming from the  bbl decrease in oil sales volumes  partially offset by an increase of million from the  mcf increase in gas sales volumes

revenues from our oil and gas sales comprised of total revenues for both and and of total revenues for natural gas production made up of our production volumes in  in  and in costs and expenses 
our general and administrative expenses  net in increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses increased million  or  over levels 
these increases reflect the increase in our corporate activities along with a reduction in reimbursement from partnerships we manage as these continue undergoing planned liquidation as voted upon by their limited partners 
our general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the portion of supervision fees netted from general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for depreciation  depletion  and amortization of our assets  or dd a  increased million  or  in from  while dd a increased million  or  from levels 
in  the increase was primarily due to additional dollars spent to add to our reserves and increased associated costs in an environment where demand for such services had increased compared to  along with a increase in production 
in  the increase was primarily due to the additional dollars spent to add to our reserves and associated costs in over our dd a rate per mcfe of production was in  in  and in  reflecting variations in per unit cost of reserves additions 
our production costs in increased million  or  over such expenses in  while those expenses in increased million  or  over costs 
our production costs per mcfe produced were in  in  and in the portion of supervision fees netted from production costs was million for  million for  and million for approximately million of the increase in production costs during was related to severance taxes 
severance taxes increased primarily from the expiration of certain specific well severance tax exemptions 
the remainder of the increase reflected costs associated with new wells drilled and acquired and the related increase in costs in procuring such services in an environment where demand for such services has increased from the prior year 
while our production costs increased in  our oil and gas sales increased 
that increase in oil and gas sales had a direct impact on the increase in production costs  as severance taxes have a direct correlation to sales and were million higher in also  the increase in commodity prices brought increased demand and competition for field services that resulted in an increase in the cost of those services 
remedial well work and workover costs increased million over levels 
in the masters creek area  salt water disposal charges  which increased million over charges  increased as the volume of water associated with that production increased 
also in the masters creek area  production chemical costs increased million as we began our scale inhibitor program in that area 
interest expense on our senior notes issued in july  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in both and and million in interest expense on our convertible notes due  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in interest expense on the credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in and million in the total interest expense in was million  of which million was capitalized 
the total interest expense was million  of which million was capitalized 
the total interest expense was million  of which million was capitalized 
we capitalize that portion of interest related to our exploration  partnership  and foreign business development activities 
the decrease in total interest expense in was attributed to the conversion and extinguishment of our convertible notes in december and the increase in capitalized interest  partially offset by the increase in interest paid on our credit facility 
the increase in interest expense in was attributed to the replacement of our bank borrowings in august with the senior notes that carry a higher interest rate 
in the fourth quarter of  we took a domestic non cash write down of oil and gas properties  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
lower prices for both oil and natural gas at december   necessitated a pre tax domestic full cost ceiling write down of million  or million after tax 
in addition to this domestic ceiling write down  we also expensed million of non recurring charges in the fourth quarter of for certain delinquent accounts receivable  the majority of which is related to gas sold to enron  and a write off of debt issuance costs for a planned offering that was cancelled based upon market conditions following the events of september  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
 amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 on january  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time net of taxes charge of  which is recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of income 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non recurring loss on the early extinguishment of debt net of taxes  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we called our convertible notes for redemption effective december  holders of approximately million of the convertible notes elected to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
holders of the remaining million of the convertible notes elected to redeem their notes for cash plus accrued interest 
this cash redemption resulted in this non recurring item 
net income loss 
our loss before extraordinary item and change in accounting principle in of million was lower and basic loss per share basic eps before extraordinary item and change in accounting principle of was lower than our net income of million and basic eps of 
these decreases reflected the effect of million in non recurring charges in as described above 
the lower percentage decrease in basic eps reflects a increase in weighted average shares outstanding in  primarily due to the conversion of our convertible notes into million shares of common stock in december our net loss for was million with a loss per share of per diluted share 
our net income for  excluding non recurring charges of million as described above  totaled million with eps of per diluted share 
these amounts are lower than our net income of million and eps of per diluted share  primarily due to significantly lower oil prices and overall increased costs 
our income before extraordinary item in of million was higher and basic eps before extraordinary item of was higher than our net income of million and basic eps of 
these increases reflected the effect of the increase in average oil prices received and increase in average gas prices received 
oil and gas prices rose each quarter and resulted in quarterly sequential increases in earnings 
the lower percentage increase in basic eps reflects an increase in weighted average shares outstanding in  primarily due to our third quarter public sale of million shares of common stock 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may pertain to  among other things  financial results  capital expenditures  drilling activity  development activities  cost savings  production efforts and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  liquidity  regulatory matters  and competition 
such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  internationally or in the united states  availability of services and supplies  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for capital  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed herein  and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
also  because of the volatility in oil and gas prices and other factors  interim results are not necessarily indicative of those for a full year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
our price risk program permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward and options contracts  and swaps to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
o price floors in we elected not to designate our price floors for special hedge accounting treatment  and instead used mark to market accounting treatment 
our adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
below is a summary of the utilization of price floors for the years ending december    and o during we recognized net gains of  related to our hedging activities  with  of losses unrealized at year end this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   we had open price floor contracts covering notional volumes of million mmbtu of natural gas 
these contracts relate to the nymex contract months of february and march at an average price of per mmbtu 
the fair value of our open contracts at december   totaled  and is included in the other current assets account on the accompanying balance sheet 
prior to adopting sfas no 
in  costs and any benefits derived from price floors were recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenues for and the costs to purchase put options were amortized over the option periods in and o the costs related to hedging activities totaled approximately  with benefits of approximately  being received  resulting in a net cash outlay of approximately  or per mcfe 
the costs related to the open contracts as of december   totaled approximately  which was our maximum exposure under those contracts 
those open contracts covering production for had a fair market value of approximately  at that date 
each of those contracts expired on or before march  o the costs related to hedging activities totaled approximately  with benefits of approximately  being received  resulting in a net cash outlay of approximately  or per mcfe 
the costs related to the open contracts as of december   totaled approximately  and had a fair market value of  o participating collars during the fourth quarter of  we entered into participating collars to hedge oil production through june below is a summary of the collar arrangements for the participating collars were designated as hedges  and realized losses were recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurred 
o we hedged  bbls of oil per month for the months january through june  with a floor price of per bbl and a ceiling price of per bbl  whereby we participate in of any amount above the ceiling price 
these participating collars closed with our recording a loss of approximately  or per mcfe produced 
there were no open participating collars at either year end or interest rate risk 
our senior notes have a fixed interest rate  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow or fair value risk from market interest rate changes on our senior notes 
at december   we had million borrowed under our credit facility  which is subject to floating rates and therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would impact cash flows by approximately million based on this same level of borrowing 
financial instruments debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based on quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair value of our senior notes was million at december   and million at december  our credit facility with the banks expires october  our million senior notes mature on august
