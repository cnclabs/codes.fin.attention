if paid in currency other than us dollars  certain currency translation rules will apply to determine the us dollar amount realized 
such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the share was a capital asset in the hands of the us shareholder and generally will be short term capital gain or loss if the share has been held for less than one year  and long term capital gain or loss if the share has been held for one year or longer
