the information in this report is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in our common stock 
we urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the sec 
the section entitled risk factors set forth in this report  and similar discussions in our other sec filings  discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully consider those risks  in addition to the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the following are critical accounting policies  which may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  which are determined based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
sales returns and allowances 
we establish  upon shipment of our products  a provision for estimated returns 
under certain circumstances we allow our customers to return products and a provision is made for such returns 
our estimate of product returns is based on contractual terms or sales agreements  historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased gross profit  should we experience increased product returns 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we may record charges to write down inventories due to excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology  the timing of these changes and our estimate of forecasted demand for our products 
we typically use a six month rolling forecast based on anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog 
we assess our current or committed inventory levels to these forecasts on a regular basis and any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased writedowns  resulting in decreased gross profit 
litigation and contingencies 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights 
in certain cases  we have accrued estimates of the amounts we expect to pay upon resolution of such matters 
should we not be able to secure the terms we expect  these estimates may change and may result in increased accruals  resulting in decreased profit 
overview we provide system level products that enable broadband communications to the home and business enterprise 
we serve the dsl and the voice over packet markets 
our current customers are broadband access equipment vendors who manufacture dsl equipment for use in the phone companies communications infrastructure or in the customer premise for internet or other network access in a home or small business 
our customers also include equipment vendors who supply voice over packet products that allow convergence of data and voice networks 
we were incorporated on february  and commenced operations on april  during the period from february through june  we were a development stage company focused on developing our initial products  recruiting personnel  building our corporate infrastructure and raising capital  and therefore had no product revenue 
in  we began shipping products and recorded our first significant product revenues in the third quarter  emerging from the development stage at that time 
since  we have also increased our investment in research and development  sales and marketing  operations and our general and administrative infrastructure 
on may   we issued million shares of our common stock in a registered underwritten initial public offering and  shares of our common stock in a concurrent private placement at a price of per share 
on june   we sold an additional  shares pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option granted in connection with our initial public offering 
net proceeds from these offerings were million and are being used for general working capital purposes and selected asset purchases 
our revenues currently are derived from the sale of our dsl and voice over packet network products  which include the copperlite co  copperlite cpe  optimizer  and entropia families of products 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for the year ended december   sumitomo electric industries and nec represented and of our revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   lucent technologies  sumitomo electric industries  copper mountain networks  nec and nortel networks represented    and  of our revenues  respectively 
our top two customers in were sumitomo electric industries and nec  who accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
during and  we recorded million and million of revenues  respectively  under best efforts technology development agreements 
revenues under these agreements represent payments we received for the performance of contract engineering services 
under these agreements  we generally received payments upon the completion of contractual milestones 
we are not required to refund any payments under the contracts 
our policy is to recognize revenue under technology development agreements when applicable contractual milestones have been met  including deliverables  in any case  revenue recognized does not exceed the amount that would be recognized using the percentage of completion method 
in this regard  the timing of technology development revenue depends on the timing of completion of milestones under individual agreements 
technology development revenue was not significant after  but we still generate revenue from certain customers under development agreements from time to time 
the costs associated with our technology development revenues are closely related to the costs of our ongoing research and development activities 
generally  the incremental costs of providing any deliverables under our technology development arrangements are not easily distinguishable from the costs of our ongoing activities  are not significant and have been included in research and development in our statements of operations 
we have focused our initial sales and marketing efforts on asian and north american communications equipment manufacturers 
during the years ended december    and   and of our revenues  respectively  were to asia 
revenues from our customers in asia increased in compared to primarily due to the broad market acceptance and use of our dsl products in japan 
revenues from our customers in north america decreased in compared to primarily due to decreases in spending in the communications equipment industry 
we currently sell through our direct sales force in china  japan  north america and the united kingdom 
we also sell through sales representatives in canada  china  hong kong  israel  italy  japan  korea  north america and taiwan 
international revenues are denominated solely in us dollars  which reduces our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred and no significant obligations remain 
allowances are provided for estimated returns at the time of shipment 
in circumstances where we have not shipped the final version of our product  or when a customer has delayed its acceptance of our product  we defer recognition of the revenue associated with the given product at the time of shipment 
in addition  we defer technology development revenues when customers make advance payments and specified milestones under the technology development contract have not been met 
this deferred revenue is recognized when the final version of the product is delivered  upon acceptance by the customer  or when the specified milestones have been met 
as of december   there was no deferred revenue 
deferred revenue as of december  was  and was comprised primarily of unearned technology development fees and prepayments from certain customers 
it usually takes more than one year for us to realize volume shipments of our products after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take six months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation of their systems and begin the marketing process  a period which typically lasts an additional three to six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our sales efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchases of our products by our customers 
our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products and can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice 
we outsource the fabrication  assembly and testing of our products 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our manufacturing partners 
costs of revenues also encompass our internal manufacturing and operations functions and a portion of our information systems and facilities costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  prototype costs related to the fabrication of our silicon chips  and depreciation associated with software development tools and amortization of deferred compensation 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
for example  we require a substantial number of prototypes to build and test our complex products and therefore incur significant prototype costs 
because our research and development is key to our future success  we intend to increase our research and development expenditures in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  customer service and applications engineering support functions  costs associated with promotional and other marketing expenses  as well as amortization of deferred compensation 
we intend to expand our direct and indirect sales operations substantially  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase market awareness  support customer requirements  and increase orders for our products 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase over the next year as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  initiate additional marketing programs to support our products and establish sales offices in additional domestic and international locations 
we intend to expand our use of independent manufacturers representatives 
we believe that to be successful  we must reach agreement with additional representatives in several countries 
in addition  the complexity of our products and the applications support necessary for successful interoperability and customer specific applications requires highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we expect to expand our customer service and support organization to meet these requirements 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  finance  accounting  facilities  information services  human resources  recruiting expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses  and amortization of deferred compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include management s estimate of potential bad debt expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business 
in connection with the grant of certain stock and other equity based compensation to our employees  technical advisors and directors  we have recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
deferred compensation is recorded upon grant and represents the difference between the grant price and the deemed fair value of our common stock options granted during these periods 
deferred compensation expense is being amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
under the graded vesting method  each option grant is separated into portions based on its vesting terms  which results in acceleration of amortization expense for the overall award 
the accelerated amortization pattern results in expensing approximately of the total award in year one  in year two  in year three and in year four 
unamortized deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our equity based compensation programs 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since our incorporation and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles in process research and development 
total operating expenses operating loss interest income interest expense loss on long term investment provision for income taxes net loss years ended december  and net revenues net revenues in were million  compared with million in  an increase of 
the growth in revenue was due to a higher volume of shipments  which increased  offset by a decrease in our average selling price and changes in product mix 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in revenues from cancellation fees 
cost of revenues cost of revenues  which reflects costs of product revenues  was million in and million in resulting in gross profit as a percentage of revenues of and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was attributable to improved yields and cost reductions at our suppliers  an increase in unit volume of shipments  and a decrease in excess and obsolete inventory writedowns as a percentage of sales 
our gross margins in the future may be affected by competitive pricing strategies and the future introduction of certain lower margin items 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to additions in engineering personnel  increased usage of materials necessary to build prototypes  increases in depreciation resulting from the additional purchases of laboratory equipment and software development tools offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of personnel  an increase in marketing activity such as customer visits and attendance at trade shows offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  which was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million  offset by increases in payroll and related costs  professional services  and business insurance expenditures 
during and  we charged  and  respectively  to bad debt expense based on our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
amortization of deferred compensation and non cash stock compensation amortization of deferred compensation  which is allocated among the above expense categories  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the use of the graded vesting method  which results in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards expected life 
in addition  expenses for and include charges of  and million  respectively  related to grants to consultants 
in process research and development expense in the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of acquired in process research and development ipr d related to our acquisition of vengines  inc the entire ipr d charge of million related to one project 
this project related to the development of high density voice processing semiconductor products  which bridge circuit switched voice and data networks 
the write off was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative future uses for the technology 
at the time of the acquisition  the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning  design  development and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product could be produced to meet its design specifications including features  function and performance 
at the acquisition date  we expected certain aspects of the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
we estimated the fair value of the acquired in process technology based upon projected future revenues and cash flows related to the product that was expected to result from the in process project 
specific consideration was given to the percentage of completion of the in process project  which was estimated at 
the forecast cash flows were discounted back to a present value using a discount rate of 
at the acquisition date  we expected to incur additional costs of million to complete the in process project  which we expected to complete in june subsequent to the acquisition date  we discontinued development efforts on this specific project and intend to use certain aspects of this technology in future products 
loss on non current investment we monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our non current equity investment and if events and circumstances indicate that the decline in value of this asset is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value to estimated fair value 
in june  in connection with the ongoing evaluation and review of our non current equity investment  we recorded a non cash charge of  to write down the basis of this investment to zero as a result of this impairment 
in january  we sold this non current equity investment for  and will report this as a gain in the first quarter of interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates obtained on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio  offset partially by an increase in average invested balances 
interest expense interest expense was  in  compared to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to the termination of our revolving credit agreement with mitsubishi international corporation in june provision for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of  for the year ended december   which represents federal and state minimum taxes as well as foreign income taxes 
we recorded a provision for foreign income taxes of  for the year ended december  as of december   we have million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively 
the net operating losses and federal credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses to date  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  includes approximately million related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be recorded in paid in capital when realized 
years ended december  and net revenues net revenues in were million  compared with million in  an increase of 
the growth in revenue resulted mainly from increases in volume shipments of our semiconductor products 
cost of revenues cost of revenues  which reflects costs of product revenues  was million in and million in resulting in gross profit as a percentage of revenues of and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to the significant increase in the unit volume of shipments 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was driven by cost reductions from our suppliers 
our gross margins in the future may be affected by competitive pricing strategies and the future introduction of certain lower margin items 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to additions in engineering personnel  increased usage of materials necessary to build prototypes  increases in depreciation resulting from the additional purchases of laboratory equipment and software development tools and an increase in amortization of deferred compensation of million 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
these increases were due primarily to the addition of personnel  an increase in marketing activity such as customer visits and attendance at trade shows and an increase in amortization of deferred compensation of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
these increases were due primarily to the addition of personnel in the accounting  human resources  information services and facilities functions and an increase in amortization of deferred compensation of million 
during and  we charged  and  respectively  to bad debt expense to reserve for specific aged customer receivable balances and to establish a reserve for unidentified potential bad debt exposures 
amortization of deferred compensation and non cash stock compensation amortization of deferred compensation  which is allocated among the above expense categories  was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase was attributable to deferred stock compensation recorded in of million related to option grants made to a significant number of new and existing employees and the use of the graded vesting method  which results in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards expected life 
in addition  expenses for and include charges of million and  respectively  related to grants to consultants 
interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase was due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from our initial public offering in may interest expense interest expense was  in  compared to  in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher outstanding balances under our working capital line of credit during liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  operating activities provided million in cash 
this was primarily the result of the net loss of million being more than offset by the non cash impact of million in amortization of deferred compensation  million of depreciation and amortization expense  million of acquired in process research and development expense and a write down of  in non current investments 
net cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a decrease in accounts receivable of million and an increase in accrued liabilities of million  offset by decreases in accounts payable of million and other current assets of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily related to net purchases of short term investments  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
cash generated from financing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily related to the net proceeds from employee stock plans 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
in  we began generating cash in an amount sufficient to fund our operations 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and planned operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments are shown in the table below in thousands payments due by period total year years ye ars over years operating leases facilities    operating leases software    inventory purchase commitments   total cash obligations    we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales  marketing  and product development programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and to fund other general corporate activities 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with intellectual property and other rights and may become party to associated claims 
in certain cases  management has accrued estimates of the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters 
depending on the amount and timing of the resolutions of these claims  our future cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas establishes accounting methods for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
we adopted fas as of january  because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities  the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  fas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  fas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
fas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we will apply fas beginning in the first quarter of fiscal application of the nonamortization provisions of fas is expected to result in an increase in net income of million per share in fiscal we will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in fas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we expect to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  in the second quarter of fiscal any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the second quarter of we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will have on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective january  fas supersedes fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of segments of a business under accounting principles board opinion no 
we do not expect that the adoption of fas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this form k 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since our incorporation and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
a general economic slowdown  and a slowdown in spending in the telecommunications industry specifically  may negatively affect our business and operating results 
there have been announcements throughout the worldwide telecommunications industry of current and planned reductions in component inventory levels and equipment production volumes  and of delays in the build out of new infrastructure 
any of these trends  if continued  could result in lower than expected demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations generally  and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
several companies in the dsl market have experienced significant business difficulties during the past year  and if there is continued softness in demand for dsl equipment  our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
since mid  a number of competitive local exchange carriers clecs in the business of installing and providing dsl service have had difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital to build their infrastructure and to introduce their services 
in  northpoint communications and rhythm netconnections voluntarily filed for bankruptcy under chapter these companies have reduced their spending on dsl equipment  which has resulted in lower than expected sales volume for dsl equipment manufacturers including some of our major customers 
in may  nortel networks  historically one of our major customers  announced plans to exit the dsl equipment business 
a continued or further slowdown in sales of dsl equipment will likely result in a decline  cancellation or delay in sales orders for our products  which are components of dsl equipment 
any such decline  cancellation or delay may negatively affect our business and operating results 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been extremely volatile and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of integrated circuit companies  announcements by us  our competitors  or others in related market segments of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss or decrease in sales to a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  loss or reduction in manufacturing capacity from one or more of our key suppliers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of our common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent or low trading volume levels of our stock  commencement of or involvement in litigation  announcements by us or our competitors of key design wins and product introductions  a decrease in the average selling price of our products  ability to achieve cost reductions  and fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments 
due to our recent implementation of an option exchange program  our management and employees may have a near term incentive to keep our stock price low 
we recently filed a statement on schedule to with the securities and exchange commission relating to an offer to our employees  including our chief executive officer  our president and our other executive officers  to exchange outstanding underwater stock options priced at or higher for new options to be issued on a future date  currently expected to be on or after june  the exercise price for the new options is expected to be equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
since the relative value of the stock option increases as the exercise price decreases  management and employees participating in the option exchange would benefit from a lower market price for our common stock on june  or such later date the new options are granted 
because our principal stockholders and management may have the ability to control stockholder votes  the premium over market price that an acquiror might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
our officers and directors and their affiliates owned or controlled approximately of our common stock as of february  accordingly  our officers and directors and their affiliates  as a group  may have the ability to control the election of a majority of the members of our board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us  or may impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us 
this concentration of ownership could also adversely affect our stock s market price or lessen any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay 
an economic slowdown in japan may adversely affect our business and operating results 
sales to customers located in japan accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  and of net revenues for the year ended december  any slowdown in the demand for our customers equipment in japan may cause our revenues to decline 
our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and major fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially affect our japanese customers demand  thereby forcing them to reduce their orders  which could adversely affect our operating results 
competing dsl technologies may be deployed in the japanese market  which may adversely impact the demand for our dsl products  market share and operating results 
we have worked in partnership with local telecommunications companies to develop the annex c standard for the japanese market and have been able to achieve a dominant market share of dsl equipment purchases in japan 
in july  a certain service provider announced plans to deploy lower priced competing dsl technologies in the japanese market 
if these competing technologies are successful  we may lose our dominant position in the japanese market and our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from international sources  and difficulties associated with international operations could harm our business 
a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from customers located outside of the united states 
for the year ended december   of our net revenues were to customers located in asia 
we may be unable to successfully overcome the difficulties associated with international operations 
these difficulties include staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  obtaining governmental approvals for products  and complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties 
we depend on a few customers and if we lose any of them our sales and operations will suffer 
we sell our dsl products primarily to network equipment manufacturers 
our top two customers for the year ended december  were sumitomo electric industries and nec  accounting for and of our revenues  respectively 
our top five customers for the year ended december  were lucent technologies  sumitomo electric industries  copper mountain networks  nec and nortel networks accounting for    and  of our revenues  respectively 
we do not have formal long term agreements with these customers  but rather sell our products to them on an order by order basis 
we expect to be dependent upon a relatively small number of large customers in future periods  although the specific customers may vary from period to period 
if we are not successful in maintaining relationships with key customers and winning new customers  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and personnel may not remain with us in the future 
we depend upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm us 
in addition  we have not obtained key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees 
competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries is intense  and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining these personnel  we will not be able to execute our business plan 
competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel 
there may be only a limited number of people with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and it may become increasingly difficult to hire these people 
also  competitors and others have in the past  and may in the future  attempt to recruit our employees 
furthermore  we rely  in part  on equity incentives to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in may we have granted  and may grant  additional equity and or cash compensation to our employees as incentive to remain with our company 
in addition  any perception by potential employees that our equity incentives are less attractive could harm our ability to attract qualified employees 
we depend on sole source suppliers for several key components of our products 
we obtain certain parts  components and packaging used in the delivery of our products from sole sources of supply 
for example  we obtain certain semiconductor wafers from mitsubishi electric and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd 
if we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required  and are unable to meet customer demand  our business could be harmed  as our customers would consider purchasing products from our competitors 
we also rely on united microelectronics corporation to manufacture our analog silicon wafers 
developing and maintaining these strategic relationships with our vendors is critical for us to be successful 
any of our sole source suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price  or be subject to production disruptions such as earthquakes 
sales of our products depend on the widespread adoption of broadband access services  especially dsl 
if the demand for broadband access service does not increase as expected  we may not be able to generate substantial sales 
sales of our products depend on the increased use and widespread adoption of broadband access services  and dsl services in particular  and the ability of telecommunications service providers to market and sell broadband access services 
our business would be harmed  and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected  if the use of broadband access services does not increase as anticipated 
certain critical factors will likely continue to affect the development of the broadband access service market 
these factors include inconsistent quality and reliability of service  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  lack of interoperability among multiple vendors network equipment  congestion in service providers networks  inadequate security  and slow deployment of new broadband services over dsl lines 
rapid changes in the market for dsl chip sets may render our chip sets obsolete or unmarketable 
the market for chip sets for dsl products is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions by our competitors  changes in customer demands  and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors could make our products obsolete or unmarketable 
to compete  we must innovate and introduce new products 
if we fail to successfully introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet customer requirements and are compatible with evolving industry standards  then our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
because other broadband technologies may compete effectively with dsl services  our products may not capture market share 
dsl services are competing with a variety of different broadband data transmission technologies  including cable modems  satellite and other wireless technologies 
if any technology that is competing with dsl technology is more reliable  faster  and less expensive or has other advantages over dsl technology  then the demand for our dsl products may decrease 
our markets are highly competitive and many of our competitors are established and have greater resources than we have 
the market for communications semiconductor and software solutions is intensely competitive 
given our stage of development  there is a substantial risk that we will not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully 
in addition  a number of other semiconductor companies have announced their intent to enter the market segments adjacent to or addressed by our products 
these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
they may be able to introduce new technologies  respond more quickly to changing customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
our customers may demand preferential terms or delay our sales cycle  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our customers are in most cases larger than us and are able to exert a high degree of influence over us 
these customers may have sufficient bargaining power to demand low prices and other terms and conditions that may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  prior to selling our products to such customers  we must typically undergo lengthy product approval processes  often taking up to one year 
accordingly  we are continually submitting successive versions of our products as well as new products to our customers for approval 
the length of the approval process can vary and is affected by a number of factors  including customer priorities  customer budgets and regulatory issues affecting telecommunication service providers 
delays in the product approval process could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have been successful in the past in obtaining product approvals from our customers  such approvals and the ensuing sales of such products may not continue to occur 
delays can also be caused by late deliveries by other vendors  changes in implementation priorities and slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that our products support 
a delay in  or cancellation of  the sale of our products could adversely affect our results from operations or cause them to significantly vary from quarter to quarter 
future consolidation in the telecommunications equipment industry may increase competition that could harm our business 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by increasing consolidation both within the telecommunications equipment sector and by companies combining or acquiring data communications assets and assets for delivering voice related services 
we cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry 
increased competition and consolidation in our industry may require that we reduce the prices of our products or result in a loss of market share  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we are now  and may in the future be  dependent on certain strategic relationships with third parties in our industry  any additional consolidation involving these parties could reduce the demand for our products and otherwise harm our business prospects 
we may make future acquisitions where advisable and acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our business is highly competitive  and as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we have addressed and may continue to address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage such growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
because our products are components of other equipment  if broadband equipment manufacturers do not incorporate our products in their equipment  we may not be able to generate sales of our products in volume quantities 
our products are not sold directly to the end user  they are components of other products 
as a result  we rely upon equipment manufacturers to design our products into their equipment 
we further rely on the manufacturing and deployment of the equipment to be successful 
if equipment that incorporates our products is not accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve sales of our products in volume quantities  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
because manufacturers of communications equipment may be reluctant to change their sources of components  if we do not achieve design wins with such manufacturers  we may be unable to secure sales from these customers in the future 
once a manufacturer of communications equipment has designed a supplier s semiconductor into its products  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of semiconductors due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier 
accordingly  our failure to achieve design wins with equipment manufacturers  which have chosen a competitor s semiconductor  could create barriers to future sales opportunities with these manufacturers 
if we deliver products with defects  our credibility will be harmed  and the sales and market acceptance of our products will decrease 
our products are complex and have contained errors  defects and bugs when introduced 
if we deliver products with errors  defects or bugs  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed 
further  if our products contain errors  defects and bugs  then we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems 
defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability from defects in our products 
a successful product liability claim could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because the sales cycle for our products typically lasts up to one year  and may be subject to delays  it is difficult to forecast sales for any given period 
if we fail to realize forecasted sales for a particular period  our stock price could decline significantly 
the sales cycle of our products is lengthy and typically involves a detailed initial technical evaluation of our products by our prospective customers  followed by the design  construction and testing of prototypes incorporating our products 
only after these steps are complete will we receive a purchase order from a customer for volume shipments 
this process generally takes from to months  and may last longer 
given this lengthy sales cycle  it is difficult to accurately predict when sales to a particular customer will occur 
in addition  we may experience unexpected delays in orders from customers  which may prevent us from realizing forecasted sales for a particular period 
our products are typically sold to equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products in the products that they in turn sell to consumers or to network service providers 
as a result  any delay by our customers  or by our customers customers  in the manufacture or distribution of their products  will result in a delay in obtaining orders of our products 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and the technologies used in our principal products  and if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property  our business will be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these measures afford only limited protection 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary 
third party claims regarding intellectual property matters could cause us to stop selling our products  pay monetary damages  or obtain licenses on adverse terms 
there is a significant risk that third parties  including current and potential competitors  will claim that our products  or our customers products  infringe on their intellectual property rights 
the owners of these intellectual property rights may bring infringement claims against us 
any such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  would be costly and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
inquiries with respect to the coverage of our intellectual property could develop into litigation 
in the event of an adverse ruling for an intellectual property infringement claim  we could be required to obtain a license or pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products stopped by an injunction 
such a license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if a customer of our chip sets cannot acquire a required license on commercially reasonable terms  that customer may choose not to use our chip sets 
we have obligations to indemnify our customers under some circumstances for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive letters from customers inquiring as to scope of these indemnity rights 
if any claims from third parties required us to indemnify customers under our agreements  the costs could be substantial and our business could be harmed 
we have received correspondence from certain parties  including texas instruments  alcatel  and ricoh  requesting us to discuss the potential need for non exclusive licenses permitting us to utilize technology covered by various patents held by these parties 
we could be subject to claims similar to the texas instruments  alcatel and ricoh claims in the future 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these claims  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
there can be no guaranty that the aggregate effect of any such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may need to raise additional capital which might not be available or which  if available  could be on terms adverse to our common stockholders 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investment balances and cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to ours 
further  if we issue equity securities  the ownership percentage of our stockholders would be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while concurrently maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the current value of the principal amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market funds  high quality commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and auction rate preferred stock 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
