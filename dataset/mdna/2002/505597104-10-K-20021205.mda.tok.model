the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the combined notes thereto 
results of operations earnings laclede group s results are primarily impacted by the regulated activities of its largest subsidiary  laclede gas  missouri s largest natural gas distribution company 
utility earnings are generated by the sale of heating energy  which historically have been heavily influenced by the weather 
the seasonal effect of the utility is tempered somewhat by the results of sm p utility resources  inc sm p  a wholly owned underground locating and marking service business acquired on january   whose operations tend to be counter seasonal to those of laclede gas 
net income applicable to common stock for fiscal was million  compared with million for fiscal  and for fiscal temperatures in the laclede gas service area during fiscal  the fifth warmest on record  were warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal temperatures during fiscal were colder than normal and colder than in fiscal which was the third warmest over the last years 
laclede group s earnings were per share for the twelve months ended september  compared with per share for the same period last year 
the 
per share decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to reduced earnings reported by laclede gas 
the utility s earnings were adversely affected by lower gas sales arising from temperatures in its service area that were significantly warmer than last year  and  the missouri public service commission s decision not to extend the utility s gas supply incentive plan gsip beyond september  the gsip produced significant benefits for customers and shareholders during the past five years during which the program was in effect 
these factors were partially offset by the benefit of the general rate increase effective on december   nearly million of pre tax income from the utility s price stabilization program psp recorded this year  and higher income from off system sales and capacity release revenues 
the psp is discussed further in the regulatory matters section below 
laclede group s consolidated earnings were positively impacted by income recorded by sm p since its acquisition on january   amounting to approximately million  or 
per share 
as a result of the colder weather experienced during fiscal compared with fiscal  consolidated earnings  at per share  were up nearly over fiscal earnings of per share 
the 
per share increase in fiscal earnings versus fiscal was primarily due to the benefit of the colder weather experienced during this benefit was partially offset by higher expenses resulting from high wholesale natural gas prices during fiscal these included a higher provision for uncollectible accounts and higher carrying costs reflecting the interest and other costs incurred by laclede gas from the date it purchased gas in the wholesale market to the time it received payment from its customers 
laclede gas does not benefit from higher wholesale natural gas prices  which are set in a competitive national market  but passes its actual purchased gas costs through to customers 
in addition to the increased costs related to the high wholesale gas prices  fiscal expenses were higher  when compared with fiscal  due to higher pension costs  expenses related to the formation of the holding company  and other increased costs of doing business 
operating revenues regulated operating revenues for fiscal year decreased million  or  below fiscal  reflecting both the return to a more traditional level of wholesale gas prices and a weather related reduction in natural gas sales 
wholesale natural gas prices are passed on to utility customers  subject to prudence review  under the purchased gas adjustment pga clause 
the decrease in operating revenues was primarily comprised of lower wholesale natural gas costs of million and lower natural gas sales levels and other variations of million 
these factors were slightly offset by the benefit of the utility s general rate increase  implemented december   amounting to million  and higher off system sales  capacity release and incentive revenues of million 
fiscal regulated operating revenues increased million  or  above fiscal primarily due to higher wholesale gas costs of million reflecting an unprecedented rise in market prices during the fiscal winter  higher gas sales volumes and other variations amounting to million  and the remaining effect of the laclede gas general rate increase of million 
these factors were slightly offset by lower off system sales and incentive revenues of million 
total therms sold and transported in were billion compared with billion in and billion in laclede group s non regulated operating revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting revenues recorded this year by its newly acquired subsidiary  sm p 
other non regulated operating revenues decreased million in fiscal from fiscal  and increased million in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to variations in gas marketing sales by laclede energy resources  inc operating expenses regulated operating expenses in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal natural and propane gas expense decreased million primarily due to decreased rates charged by suppliers and lower volumes purchased for sendout due to the warmer weather  partially offset by higher off system gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to higher group insurance charges  higher wage rates  increased insurance premiums  lower net pension credits  and costs to remove retired utility plant 
these factors were partially offset by a lower provision for uncollectible accounts and reduced distribution and maintenance charges 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to the effect of lower depreciation rates instituted december  and negative amortization of a portion of the depreciation reserve effective july   as authorized by the mopsc see note related to utility plant  depreciation and amortization 
these effects were partially offset by increased depreciable property 
taxes  other than income  decreased million  or  primarily due to lower gross receipts taxes  reflecting the decreased revenues 
regulated operating expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal natural and propane gas expense increased million in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to nationwide increases in natural gas rates charged by our suppliers and higher volumes purchased for sendout arising from the colder weather  the effects of which were slightly offset by lower off system sales gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses in increased million  or  over primarily due to increased net pension costs  a higher provision for uncollectible accounts  increased distribution and maintenance costs  higher wage rates  and other increases in the costs of doing business 
depreciation and amortization expense in increased million  or  primarily due to additional depreciable property 
taxes  other than income taxes  increased million in compared with the increase was principally attributable to higher gross receipts taxes  reflecting increased gas sales revenues 
laclede group s non regulated operating expenses increased million in fiscal due to the operating expenses of sm p 
other non regulated operating expenses decreased million in fiscal compared with  and increased million in fiscal compared with primarily due to variations in expenses associated with gas marketing sales by laclede energy resources  inc other income and income deductions net other income and income deductions net decreased 
million in fiscal compared with fiscal  and increased 
million in fiscal compared with fiscal 
the variations for both periods primarily reflect higher interest income recorded in fiscal  partially offset by expenses related to the holding company formation and strategic planning initiatives also recorded in that same year 
interest charges interest expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to decreased short term interest expense reflecting lower rates and reduced average borrowings  partially offset by higher interest on long term debt resulting from the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in june and interest charges related to the bank note used to finance the acquisition of sm p 
interest expense increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in september  the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in june  and increased short term interest expense reflecting the net effect of higher average borrowings and lower rates 
income taxes the variations in income taxes for all periods reported are primarily due to changes in pre tax income 
labor agreement on july   laclede gas and union representatives reached a new four year labor agreement replacing the prior agreement that was to expire july  the new contract extends through july  the settlement resulted in wage increases of in all four years  along with lump sum payment provisions and other benefit improvements 
recent developments in november  sm p was notified by two customers that  due to actions they have taken to address workforce management issues  they do not intend to continue to outsource certain functions at this time  which include locating services provided by sm p after february and march revenue from these customers totaled approximately million  or approximately of sm p s revenues and of laclede group s consolidated revenues  for fiscal management is currently evaluating the impact of this development on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
laclede gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
the provisions of sfas no 
require  among other things  that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators  where appropriate 
these actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non regulated enterprises 
when this occurs  costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet regulatory assets and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates 
also  regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future regulatory liabilities 
regulatory matters at the state level  there have been several important developments during the fiscal year affecting laclede gas  some of which are still pending 
on january   laclede filed a request with the missouri public service commission mopsc or commission for a general rate increase of million annually to recover costs related to the operation of its gas distribution system 
as part of this rate increase filing  the utility proposed a weather mitigation plan that would protect its customers from weather related fluctuations in their bills and help stabilize its annual revenues in that regard 
on october   the commission approved a settlement reached among the parties to the case 
the terms of the settlement include an annual rate increase of million effective on november   a moratorium on additional rate filings until march   and an innovative rate design that is expected to provide the utility with the ability to recover its distribution costs  which are essentially fixed  in a manner that is significantly less sensitive to weather 
the settlement also provided for  among other things  changes resulting in negative amortization of the depreciation reserve of million annually effective from july  until the utility s next rate case proceeding  minor changes in depreciation rates effective january   and changes in the regulatory treatment of pension costs primarily designed to stabilize such costs  effective during fiscal also approved was an incentive program beginning in fiscal under which the utility may achieve  under specific conditions  income related to management of its gas supply commodity costs 
on march   laclede gas filed an application requesting that the mopsc issue an accounting authority order aao that would allow laclede gas to defer for future recovery consideration unrecovered costs due solely to the negative impact of the extraordinarily warm weather experienced in the utility s service area during the winter of laclede gas has filed to withdraw its application in conjunction with the rate case settlement 
on may   laclede gas filed a request with the missouri public service commission for a general rate increase of million annually to recover costs related to the operation of its distribution system 
this filing culminated in a settlement among the parties to the case  which was approved by the commission on november  the settlement provided laclede gas an annual increase of about million effective december  additionally  effective on december  laclede gas was permitted to charge customers to cover the cost of initiating service at a particular address 
this new charge was anticipated to generate additional revenue of approximately million annually 
the settlement also provided for the continued deferral of certain costs related to the laclede gas pipe replacement program as well as recovery of costs previously deferred under that program 
the cost of removing retired utility plant is treated as an expense pursuant to this settlement  rather than being included in depreciation rates 
however  laclede gas will continue to pursue a reversal of the commission s treatment of depreciation rates in the courts as discussed in greater detail below 
as part of the settlement  laclede gas agreed to implement the terms of a rulemaking promulgated by the commission on november  that relaxed the requirements for the fiscal heating season for reinstatement of certain customers who had been disconnected for nonpayment 
the settlement provides for a recovery mechanism under which laclede gas will be reimbursed for any incremental costs associated with the new rule 
finally  under the terms of the agreement  laclede gas continues to be permitted to retain all income resulting from sales made outside its traditional service area  and is permitted to retain all income from releases of available pipeline capacity 
laclede gas previously appealed the mopsc s decision in its rate case relative to the calculation of its depreciation rates 
the circuit court remanded the decision to the mopsc based on inadequate findings of fact 
the mopsc upheld its previous order and laclede gas appealed this second order to the circuit court 
on april   the court ruled that the mopsc s second order was lawful and reasonable 
on june   laclede gas appealed the circuit court s decision to the missouri western district court of appeals 
all briefs to the court of appeals have been submitted and oral arguments have been scheduled for december under the gsip of laclede gas  the utility shared with its customers certain gains and losses related to the acquisition and management of its gas supply assets 
in fiscal  the gsip contributed 
per share to consolidated earnings 
the provisions of the gsip extended through september  in september  the mopsc ruled that the gsip should be allowed to expire 
on february   the mopsc denied laclede gas application for rehearing 
laclede gas filed a petition for judicial review of the mopsc s decision with the cole county circuit court  together with a motion requesting that the mopsc s decision be stayed 
the request for stay was denied on may  the petition for judicial review is still pending 
however  pursuant to the rate case settlement approved by the mopsc in november  and consistent with the rate case settlement  the mopsc authorized laclede gas to retain all income from releases of pipeline capacity effective december   which previously was shared with customers under the gsip 
laclede gas continues to retain all income resulting from sales outside of its traditional service area  as previously authorized by the mopsc 
however  laclede gas was not able to retain any of the savings it obtains relative to gas supply costs or any savings it obtains from pipeline discounts 
income related to releases of available pipeline capacity and sales made outside its traditional service area are volatile in nature and subject to market conditions 
see note for more information on the gsip 
the price stabilization program psp authorized laclede gas to purchase certain financial instruments in an effort to hedge against significant increases in the cost of natural gas 
the cost of such financial instruments  however  like the cost of natural gas itself  increased significantly during fiscal as a result  the mopsc granted the request of laclede gas to reduce the amount of natural gas purchases required to be covered by such financial instruments for that heating season 
in february  the mopsc approved modifications to the psp  including a provision that million in supplemental funding be added to the psp for the purchase of financial instruments for the fiscal heating season 
concurrently  laclede gas relinquished a claim on million arising from gains realized from the purchase and sale of such instruments during the fiscal heating season and offered to utilize a similar amount to provide for future funding for such instruments in the event the program was allowed to continue 
the mopsc also approved modifications to the psp to reduce the fiscal percentage of gas requirements to be covered by the psp 
the psp was allowed to expire at the end of the fiscal heating season  at which time the utility recorded nearly million of pre tax income produced through the program 
on june   the staff of the mopsc filed its recommendation in a proceeding established to review laclede gas gas costs for fiscal in its recommendation  the staff proposed to disallow the approximately million of pre tax income achieved under the psp 
laclede gas believes that staff s position lacks merit and continues to vigorously oppose the adjustment in a proceeding before the mopsc  the hearing for which is currently scheduled to occur in february regulatory proceeding results are uncertain  and to the extent that a final commission decision sustains staff s recommended disallowance  the outcome of the proceeding could have a material effect on the future financial position and results of operations of laclede gas 
missouri statutes provide an opportunity for court review of commission decisions 
the pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies 
the utility is allowed to file to modify  on a periodic basis  the level of gas costs in its pga 
previously  the commission allowed two scheduled pga filings each year  one for the summer months and another for the winter period  plus one unscheduled winter filing if certain conditions were met 
the significant fluctuations in natural gas prices during fiscal necessitated additional unscheduled filings  which were approved by the mopsc  to better match customer billings with market natural gas prices 
in february  the mopsc approved laclede gas proposal to revise its pga clause to adjust the gas cost component of its rates more frequently to recover its costs 
the new approved tariffs allow scheduled gas cost adjustments in november  january  march and june  thereby enabling laclede gas to more closely recover its costs of gas  especially during the high volume winter months 
as part of the same ruling  the mopsc clarified that costs  cost reductions and carrying costs associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments except as provided previously under the psp are gas costs recoverable through the pga mechanism 
on march   the staff of the mopsc recommended in a proceeding to review laclede gas gas costs for fiscal to disallow the recovery of approximately million in gas costs 
the alleged grounds were that laclede gas had slightly more transportation capacity than necessary to serve its customers 
the utility demonstrated to the staff the appropriateness of the then current level of transportation capacity 
on may   the staff revised its recommendation to withdraw the million proposed disallowance 
on may   the staff of the commission filed a motion to investigate laclede gas company s alleged transfer of its gas supply function to laclede energy services  inc les  a subsidiary of laclede group  and such action s ramifications  including whether such alleged transfer required commission approval or was otherwise lawful 
on june  laclede gas responded  pointing out that it had not transferred its gas supply functions to les but had instead delegated six employees to les with responsibility for performing various gas supply administrative duties  many of which had been performed in prior years by an outside party 
laclede gas remains primarily responsible for the gas supply function 
laclede gas urged the commission to deny staff s motion on this and other grounds 
the commission concluded that a case should be established to investigate the issues raised by the staff 
the commission also ordered the staff to file a status report regarding progress of the investigation and laclede gas to file any responses to the staff s status report 
laclede gas believes its actions comply with applicable law and intends to vigorously defend its position 
the outcome of any regulatory proceeding is uncertain 
however  laclede gas does not believe that the eventual outcome of the case will have a material effect on the financial results of laclede gas 
on july   laclede gas filed a proposed catch up keep up program with the mopsc that would permit the company to use a portion of the savings from its negotiated pipeline discounts to fund a low income energy assistance program 
pursuant to  and among revisions to the program filed by the utility on september   the amount of discount savings that could be used for this purpose would be limited to million per year 
in response to certain objections filed by the mopsc staff and missouri office of the public counsel  the commission has suspended the tariffs implementing the program and scheduled a prehearing conference that occurred on october  evidentiary hearings are scheduled for early december  accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires all business combinations in the scope of this statement to be accounted for using the purchase method 
the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated after june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses how acquired goodwill and other intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon acquisition and after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied at the beginning of fiscal the company had adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with the acquisition of sm p 
as required by sfas no 
 the goodwill for sm p is being accounted for consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas nos 
and did not have a material effect on the financial position and results of operations of laclede group 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement is effective for fiscal the provisions of the statement provide for rate regulated entities that meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 such as laclede gas  to recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for differences in the timing of recognition of the period costs associated with asset retirement obligations for financial reporting pursuant to this statement and rate making purposes 
the effect of the adoption of this statement on october  did not have a material effect on the financial position and results of operations of laclede group 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to consolidate accounting guidance on various issues related to this matter 
this statement is effective for fiscal adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position and results of operations of laclede group 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of laclede group 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
the consensus rescinded eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
the consensus precludes mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts not within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
the consensus to rescind eitf is applicable for fiscal periods beginning after december   except that energy trading contracts not within the scope of sfas no 
purchased after october   but prior to the implementation of the consensus  are not permitted to apply mark to market accounting 
the eitf also reached a consensus that gains and losses on derivative instruments within the scope of sfas no 
should be shown net in the income statement if the derivative instruments are purchased for trading purposes 
application of these consensuses is not expected to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of laclede group 
inflation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions  regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business of laclede gas  the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant 
rate regulation  to which laclede gas is subject  allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation 
while no plans exist to undertake replacements of plant in service other than normal replacements and those under existing replacement programs  laclede gas believes that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities would be recovered through the normal regulatory process 
credit ratings as of september   credit ratings for outstanding securities for laclede group and laclede gas issues were as follows type of facility s p moody s fitch laclede group corporate rating a laclede gas first mortgage bonds a a a laclede gas commercial paper a p on april   standard poor s s p downgraded the rating for laclede gas first mortgage bonds from aa to a  and also downgraded the commercial paper rating from a to a s p cited bondholder protection parameters that have eroded due to several successive warmer than normal winters and increasing debt leverage as reasons for the downgrade 
s p ratings outlook is currently stable 
moody s investors service moody s downgraded laclede gas first mortgage bonds from aa to a on may  moody s cited concerns regarding laclede s weakened credit measures due to increased earnings pressure and near term regulatory risk 
on august   moody s announced additional downgrades  as the laclede gas first mortgage bonds were lowered from a to a and its commercial paper rating was lowered from p to p the outlook indication from moody s is now stable 
moody s cited laclede gas declining debt protection measures and the continuing sensitivity of its earnings and cash flow to weather fluctuations in the absence of regulatory relief for warmer than normal winters  as well as other pending regulatory matters 
moody s indicated that it would review the potential impact of pending regulatory decisions as they occur 
ratings from fitch ratings remained unchanged from the past year 
however  on october   fitch ratings revised the rating outlook from stable to negative  citing recent deterioration in consolidated credit measures 
despite these recent downgrades  the company s ratings remain investment grade  and the company believes that it will have adequate access to the markets to meet its capital requirements 
these ratings remain subject to review and change by the rating agencies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from the operations of laclede gas  net of dividend payments  has generally provided the principal liquidity to meet operating requirements and to fund the majority of its construction program 
any remaining funding requirements for construction or other needs have been provided by long term and short term financing 
the issuance of long term financing is dependent on management s evaluation of need  financial market conditions  and other factors 
short term financing is used to meet seasonal cash requirements and or to defer long term financing until market conditions are favorable 
short term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when laclede gas borrows money to cover the gap between when it purchases its natural gas and when its customers pay for that gas 
these short term cash requirements have traditionally been met through the sale of commercial paper supported by lines of credit with banks 
during the fiscal year heating season  laclede gas had lines of credit in place of up to million 
laclede gas sold commercial paper aggregating to a maximum of million at any one time during the fiscal year  but did not borrow from the banks under the aforementioned agreements 
at this writing  laclede gas has aggregate lines of credit totaling million 
short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
based on short term borrowings at september   a change in interest rates of basis points would increase or decrease pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis 
most of laclede gas lines of credit include a covenant limiting total debt  including short term debt  to no more than of total capitalization 
on september   total debt was of total capitalization 
on june   laclede gas issued million of first mortgage bonds with an interest rate of at an overall cost of 
the bonds were dated june  and mature june  the proceeds were used to repay short term debt 
the bonds were rated aaa by standard poor s and fitch ratings and aaa by moody s in consideration of insurance issued by ambac assurance covering the timely payment of the principal of  and interest on  the bonds 
these ratings apply only to these insured bonds  and not to the other outstanding uninsured bonds of laclede gas 
these bonds were issued under laclede gas shelf registration statement on form s and mopsc authorization obtained in of the million of securities originally registered under this s  million of debt securities remained registered and unissued as of september  the amount  timing and type of securities remaining to be issued under the shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
at september   laclede gas had fixed rate long term debt  including current portion  totaling million 
while these long term debt issues are fixed rate  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
however  increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if laclede gas were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity 
short term cash requirements outside of laclede gas have been met thus far with internally generated funds 
however  laclede group has put into place a working capital line of credit for million  expiring in june  to meet short term funding needs of its non utility subsidiaries 
while this line has not been used to date  it is expected to be used for seasonal needs of the various subsidiaries from time to time throughout the year 
at september   laclede group had a bank note in the amount of million related to the acquisition of sm p 
the weighted average interest rate during fiscal was 
on april   laclede group filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec in connection with the sale of up to million of equity securities  other than preferred stock  and debt securities 
this registration statement became effective on may  the amount  timing and type of financing to be issued under this shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
certain of the company s credit facilities include rating triggers which would trigger default in the event that the company s ratings fall below a specified level 
these triggers apply specifically to the million outstanding bank loan which was used to acquire sm p and the million working capital line of credit none of such line of credit has been employed at this writing 
both the bank loan and the line of credit were obtained from u 
s 
bank national association  and include interest rates at the lower of a rate indexed to libor  or prime 
the applicable rating triggers are a rating on laclede gas company s senior secured debt of no lower than a moody s or a s p 
therefore  these triggers would take effect in the event of a downgrade of three notches from the current level by s p or of one notch by moody s 
construction expenditures for utility purposes were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal laclede gas expects fiscal utility construction expenditures to approximate million 
non regulated construction expenditures for fiscal were million  and are estimated at approximately 
million in fiscal sm p has several operating leases  the aggregate annual cost of which is approximately million  consisting primarily of month operating leases  with renewal options  for vehicles used in its business 
upon acquisition of sm p  laclede group assumed parental guarantees of certain of those vehicle leases 
laclede group anticipates that the maximum guarantees will not exceed million 
during fiscal  laclede group issued guarantees totaling million for performance and payment of certain gas supply purchases by laclede energy resources  inc its non regulated marketing affiliate 
consolidated capitalization at september  consisted of common stock equity  
preferred stock and long term debt 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was for  for and for it is management s view that the company has adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources  both internal and external  to meet anticipated capital requirements 
market risk the management of laclede gas has adopted a risk management policy that provides for the purchase of natural gas financial instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers 
this policy prohibits speculation 
costs and cost reductions  including carrying costs  associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments except as provided for previously under the psp are allowed to be passed on to the utility s customers through the operation of its purchased gas adjustment clause  through which the mopsc allows the utility to recover gas supply costs 
accordingly  laclede gas does not expect any earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments 
at september   the utility held approximately million mmbtu of futures contracts at an average price of per mmbtu 
additionally  approximately million mmbtu of price risk mitigation was in place through the use of option based strategies 
these positions have various expiration dates  the longest of which extends through march in the course of its business  laclede group s non regulated marketing affiliate  laclede energy resources  inc ler  enters into fixed price commitments for the sale of natural gas to customers 
ler manages the price risk associated with these sales by closely matching the purchases of physical supplies at fixed prices to lock in margins 
at september   ler s open positions were not material to laclede group s financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters laclede gas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations that  to date  have not materially affected the company s financial position and results of operations 
as these laws  regulations  and their interpretation evolve  however  additional costs may be incurred 
with regard to a former manufactured gas plant site located in shrewsbury  missouri  laclede gas and state and federal environmental regulators have agreed upon certain actions and those actions are nearing completion 
laclede gas currently estimates the overall costs of these actions will be approximately million 
as of september   laclede gas has paid or reserved for these actions 
if regulators require additional actions  laclede gas will incur additional costs 
laclede gas enrolled a second former manufactured gas plant site into the missouri voluntary cleanup program vcp 
the vcp provides opportunities to minimize the scope and cost of site cleanup while maximizing possibilities for site development 
this site is located in and is presently owned by the city of st 
louis  missouri 
the city of st
