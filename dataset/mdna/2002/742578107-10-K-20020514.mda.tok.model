item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition on form k should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements except for historical information  the annual report and form k contain forward looking statements about printronix  within the meaning of the private securities reform act of terms such as objectives  believes  expects  plans  intends  estimates  anticipates  forecasts  projections  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  including adverse business conditions and a failure to achieve growth in the computer industry and in the economy in general  our ability to achieve growth in the asia pacific market  adverse political and economic events in our markets  a worsening of the global economy due to general conditions  a worsening of the global economy resulting from terrorist attacks  our ability to hold or increase market share with respect to line matrix printers  our ability to successfully compete against entrenched competition in the thermal printer market  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  the ability of our customers to achieve their sales projections  upon which we have in part based our sales and marketing plans  our ability to retain our customer base and channel  and our ability to continue to develop and market new and innovative products superior to those of the competition and to keep pace with technological 
table of contents change 
we do not undertake to publicly update or revise any of our forward looking statements even if experience or future changes show that the indicated results or events will not be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of printronix in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the most critical accounting policies used to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements are the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
our sales are based on written contractual agreements with our resellers that include established pricing and terms 
customers may return products that do not function properly upon delivery or are incompatible with the application 
we continuously monitor and track such product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of significant pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such information is known 
we record estimated revenue reductions for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing  rebates  or other programs 
we offer printer maintenance services through service agreements that customers may purchase separately from the printer 
these agreements are covered by written contracts and are mostly one year in duration 
we provide the point of customer contact and initial diagnostic services  and supply the parts used for printer repairs 
we have contracted with third parties to perform the on site repair services 
revenue from these agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract  which approximately matches costs incurred 
we offer professional services  such as installation  training and customized applications to customers 
these services are billed separately upon completion and acceptance of the service 
while the revenue received from professional services is not currently material  professional services are considered an area of potential growth 
accounts receivable we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated bad debt losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we have identified 
while such bad debt losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable include substantial receivables from a few large resellers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these resellers could result in additional allowances that could affect our future operating results 
inventories we record a provision to value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory  or the current estimated market value of the inventory  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
we engage in product quality programs and processes  including evaluating our suppliers 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangibles assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
in the event the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would record an adjustment to the carrying value of the assets affected 
while we make every effort to ensure our long lived assets are recoverable  any major unanticipated change in circumstances could have a significant impact on the recoverability of long lived assets and on our operating results 
income taxes we estimate our income tax liability based upon current tax laws in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes 
we periodically review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if the provision for income tax is inadequate  or if we are unable to realize deferred tax assets  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  we could experience income tax charges in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  or if we are able to realize additional deferred tax assets  or if tax laws change favorably  we could experience reduced income tax charges 
we have operations in multiple international taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues 
while we believe we have made adequate provision for any such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year and overview revenue for fiscal year was negatively impacted by the slow worldwide economy and reduced capital spending within our target markets 
despite lower revenue  we returned to profitability due to several factors  including the improved gross margins resulting from the completion of the restructuring efforts initiated and completed in fiscal year  certain price increases and a continual product cost reduction program 
cash balances increased by million and inventory decreased by million 
our focus during the year has been to develop future revenue opportunities by expanding the major accounts marketing program  and by expanding customer services 
we have initiated programs to pursue total printing solutions in the retail logistics and automotive vertical markets 

table of contents comparison of fiscal year and overview revenue for fiscal year was lower than fiscal year  partly due to one additional week in the prior fiscal year  and partly due to lower sales across all regions and all product lines  except the thermal product line 
we attribute the decrease to the general downturn in the worldwide economy 
we believe the slowdown in plant expansions and the announcement of plant closures were contributing factors to our lower sales 
during fiscal year  we announced and completed various restructuring efforts  which were designed to improve manufacturing efficiencies worldwide at a lower level of sales 
the majority of the loss from operations for the fiscal year was due to the restructuring costs 
during the later part of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see improved margins as a result of the restructuring efforts 
the fiscal year resulted in a loss of million  compared with income of million in the prior year 
net sales fiscal years and revenue for the fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we attribute the decrease to the soft worldwide economy and the resultant slowdown in capital spending for plant expansion or refurbishment 
printronix printers are used in manufacturing  supply chain logistics  business critical applications and have a long life  which allows users to delay programs to upgrade these printers in times of economic uncertainty 
thermal printer sales are primarily driven by new plant infrastructure projects and have been affected by the lower capital spending 
the decrease in sales was principally due to lower sales in the americas 
the decrease in sales was across all product lines 
we were also impacted by lower sales to our major customer 
americas sales were million  down million  or  from a year ago 
americas distribution sales decreased to million 
americas oem sales decreased to million 
lower sales to some of printronix s larger oem customers were only partially offset by higher sales to some of the smaller oems 
emea sales decreased million  or  to million 
emea oem sales were unchanged from the prior year at million 
emea distribution sales were million  down from million a year ago 
asia pacific sales increased million  or  from a year ago to million  mostly as a result of increased line matrix sales into india and china 
line matrix sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year 
line matrix revenue was of revenue versus in the prior fiscal year 
laser sales totaled million  down from the prior fiscal year 
laser revenue was of revenue compared with in the prior fiscal year 
thermal sales were million  down from the prior fiscal year 
thermal sales were of revenue compared with in the prior fiscal year 
verification products were million  a decrease of million from the prior fiscal year 
verification product sales were of revenue  compared with in the prior fiscal year 
sales of recurring items such as spares  consumables and customer services  included in the product line sales discussed above  were million  down from the prior fiscal year 
sales to our largest customer  ibm  represented of net sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the second largest customer represented of net sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the top customers represented and of net sales for the current and prior fiscal year  respectively 
sales by channel were oem and distribution compared with oem and distribution for the prior fiscal year 
revenue from united states customers was and of total revenue  while revenue from international customers was and of total revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
net sales fiscal years and fiscal year revenue was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with fiscal year the decrease was mainly due to lower sales across all regions and all product lines  except the thermal product line  which was up  and partly due to one additional week in fiscal year americas distribution sales decreased to million 
americas oem sales decreased to million  mostly due to a decrease in sales to our largest customer 
emea sales decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to a drop in the line matrix business to our largest customer 
asia pacific sales decreased million  or  from the prior fiscal year to million  mostly as a result of lower sales into india and china 
line matrix sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the drop in oem sales 
line matrix revenue was of total fiscal year revenue versus in 
table of contents fiscal year laser sales totaled million  down from the prior fiscal year 
thermal sales were million  up over fiscal year  due to the new t product line  which was launched late in the third quarter of fiscal verification products were million  compared with million in fiscal due to a large one time order from the united states postal service in fiscal sales of recurring items such as spares  consumables and customer services were million in fiscal  down from fiscal sales to our largest customer  ibm  represented of total sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago  and were lower largely due to a reorganization by that company 
sales to the second largest customer represented of total sales for the fiscal year  compared with a year ago 
sales to the top customers were and of revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
sales by channel were oem and distribution compared with oem and distribution for fiscal year revenue from united states customers was and of total revenue  while revenue from international customers was and of total revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit percentage during fiscal year is due to a full year of benefits of the manufacturing restructuring activities which were completed in late fiscal year  together with continuing cost reductions  certain price increases  and a more favorable product mix 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal year was due to lower sales volume  unfavorable product mix  the introduction of the inch thermal product  and the ramp up of thermal printer production that was based on high cost soft tooling 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  gross margin improved as we realized lower product costs resulting from the manufacturing restructuring activities 
operating expenses operating expenses  excluding restructuring charges  consist of engineering and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative costs 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring charges  were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe it is critical to continue to invest in r d to ensure technology leadership in line matrix and thermal printing solutions 
engineering expenses consist mostly of labor and test materials 
in fiscal years and  expenditures were made to enhance the line matrix product family with a faster printer  resulting in the introduction of the p during fiscal year the p is the world s fastest line matrix printer  printing lines per minute 
we also enhanced our market leading printer management networking solutions with printnet enterprise and odv verification solutions 
in fiscal year  engineering expenditures were made to complete the t thermal product line by bringing to market the t inch thermal printer 
in fiscal  we spent million on engineering and development  compared with million in fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower development costs as both the t product line and p line matrix printer moved into production 
as a percentage of sales  engineering and development expenses increased slightly  due to lower revenue  to from in fiscal and in fiscal engineering and development expenses decreased in fiscal from the prior fiscal year due to lower development costs for the t product line 
in fiscal  engineering expenditures were made to develop and bring new products to market  including the new printronix designed and manufactured t thermal printer  odv capability that ensures all bar codes are scannable  and expanded network management capabilities to all three printing technologies 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal is largely due to higher labor and marketing costs due to increased resources being applied to the major accounts marketing program 
fiscal expenses decreased from fiscal due mostly to lower commissions  lower labor costs  and lower travel expenses 

table of contents general and administrative spending increased to million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal general and administrative expenses increased due to higher property taxes  higher labor costs  increased bad debt provision  higher legal fees  and higher utility costs associated with the california energy shortage 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to lower labor costs 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal restructuring charges information on restructuring charges can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency  net foreign currency transactions and remeasurements were a loss of million in fiscal compared with gains of million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal year foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses were due primarily to a weakened euro 
a summary of the effects of the euro can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
interest and other expenses  net interest and other expenses  net  decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal due to lower interest expense as a result of reduced interest rates  partially offset by lower interest income 
interest and other expenses  net  increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal due to higher interest expense on our line of credit and long term borrowings 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily as a result of domestic operating losses due to the revenue declines in the americas and a shift in the geographic composition of pre tax earnings to entities that operate with lower tax rates 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal to be between and 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was a benefit of  primarily as a result of domestic operating losses and a shift in the geographic composition of pre tax earnings to entities that operate with lower tax rates 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the provision for taxes included certain state and foreign taxes for all fiscal years presented 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years and the primary source of liquidity has historically been cash generated from operations 
for the fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased to million from million in fiscal primarily due to a return to profitability  reductions in inventory  lower accounts receivable  and reduced capital expenditures 
we generated million in cash provided by operations during the fiscal year  compared with a use of cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
accounts receivable decreased due to lower sales 
inventory levels decreased as a result of completing the manufacturing restructuring wherein certain manufacturing processes were consolidated in the singapore facilities  which had resulted in carrying more inventory during the transition  and also due to other manufacturing programs 
investment in property  plant and equipment was less than depreciation expense as we completed our major product development efforts 
the remaining major uses of cash were payments on the line of credit totaling million and payments made on the long term note of million 
fiscal years and cash and cash equivalents decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the loss from operations in fiscal and changes in inventory levels and accounts payable 
several reasons caused the 
table of contents inventory to increase over fiscal amounts 
our restructuring plans centralized more manufacturing in the singapore plant  which resulted in higher levels of in transit inventory than the prior fiscal year 
we also manufactured line matrix ribbons in china in fiscal  which were previously purchased from a united states supplier  which owned the inventory and shipped product direct to our customers 
by manufacturing the ribbons  we enjoy higher gross margins  but are required to carry inventory 
we also carried more inventory than the prior year to meet the demand for the t thermal printer  which was launched in late fiscal lastly  we temporarily carried higher inventory levels as we worked through the various manufacturing restructuring activities 
accounts payable decreased in fiscal from the prior year based in part on the lower sales levels  but also due to not purchasing as much inventory after the restructuring activities 
the remaining major uses of funds in fiscal were net repayments on the line of credit totaling million  the repurchase of printronix common stock totaling million  and capital expenditures of million 
the major source of funds in fiscal was borrowing million secured by our irvine facility  the proceeds of which were used to pay the million line of credit borrowings see note on page of this annual report on form k 
on may   we increased our credit facility with a united states bank to million from million 
the million consisted of a million  seven year note secured by our irvine facility and a million three year unsecured line of credit 
we repaid the line of credit borrowings as scheduled in the first quarter of fiscal  and  on june   cancelled our million unsecured line of credit see note on page of this annual report on form k 
we ended fiscal year with long term debt of million and short term debt of million related to the note 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated under certain borrowing and lease commitments 
the minimum payments due as of march   for the subsequent fiscal years  are as follows in thousands payments due contractual obligations thereafter total operating leases see note   long term debt see note  total contractual cash obligations    we are also obligated under certain unsecured lines of credit and a credit agreement for our foreign subsidiaries

other risks and uncertainties could also affect our business 
any of these factors could cause the actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements in this document 
while we reassess material trends and uncertainties affecting our results of operations and financial condition in connection with the preparation of our quarterly and annual reports  we do not intend to review or revise  in light of future 
table of contents events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this document 
the information contained below should be carefully considered when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this document 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
the printing solutions industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  periodic product obsolescence  evolving industry standards  changing information technologies and evolving distribution channels 
we must adapt quickly to changing technological  application and solutions needs  and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
we could incur substantial cost to keep pace with the technological changes  and may not be able to adapt to these changes 
while we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to these characteristics  this may change in the future 
our future success largely depends upon our ability to continuously develop new products  services and solutions 
to develop new products  we invest in research and development 
in spite of our efforts  we may fail to develop new products 
additionally  the new products we develop may not achieve market acceptance or may not be manufactured at competitive costs or in sufficient volumes 
we cannot guarantee the success of our research and development efforts 
our failure to enhance our existing products  services and solutions or to develop and introduce new products  services and solutions that meet changing customer requirements and evolving technological standards would adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
we operate in a highly competitive market 
the market for medium and high speed computer printers is highly competitive 
we compete directly with several companies of various sizes  including some of the largest businesses in the united states and japan 
our competitors include privately held companies  publicly held companies and subsidiaries of multinational corporations 
our current main competitors include tally  genicom  zebra technologies corporation nasdaq zbra  tokyo electric company tec  sato  hitachi  ye data and intermec nyse una  in addition to a number of other companies 
some competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  sales  marketing and other resources than we do and have achieved greater name recognition for their products and technologies than we have 
we may not be able to successfully increase our market penetration or our overall share of the printer market 
we can offer no assurance that products with superior market acceptance  superior price or superior performance will not be introduced by our competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins  loss of market share and could require increased investment in research and development  sales and marketing and expenditures to expand distribution channels 
if we fail to address our competitive challenges  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we sell a large portion of our products to a small number of resellers oems and distributors and we expect that this will continue 
we rely upon a few resellers for a significant amount of our revenue and the loss of any one of these resellers would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to provide industrial strength printing solutions to a broader customer base and maintain good relationships with our major oems and distributors 
we believe that continued purchase of our products by oems is dependent upon many factors  including oems desire to utilize outside suppliers rather than investing the capital resources necessary to develop their own products 
our dependence on a small number of major resellers oems and distributors exposes us to numerous risks  including loss of channel  
table of contents customers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a customer decide to manufacture printers internally 
we cannot guarantee that a major reseller will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in an environment of unpredictable demand 
our sales to resellers are usually made under purchase orders with short delivery requirements 
while we receive periodic order forecasts from our major reseller  they have no obligation to purchase the forecasted amounts and may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice 
we cannot guarantee that our quarterly results of operations will not be adversely affected in the future by such changes or cancellations 
we are reliant upon domestic and foreign suppliers 
our products are manufactured using raw materials and components that are acquired domestically and internationally 
we utilize a large number of suppliers and regularly evaluate the availability of potential alternate suppliers should circumstances change with existing suppliers 
we internally develop most of the software utilized in our products 
certain software is purchased from suppliers through royalty agreements 
if we were to experience a sudden loss of availability of purchased raw materials and components or purchased software  we are unable to guarantee that we could quickly obtain the needed items from alternate sources 
our ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected  thus affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely heavily on our international facilities for the manufacture of our products  key components and configuration 
future operating results may be adversely affected by several factors  including  but not limited to  failure of our international production and configuration facilities or international suppliers to supply products reliably  disruptions in international trade  or production and supply constraints that could result in additional costs 
we have international operations  customers and suppliers 
there are many risks associated with international operations  including  but not limited to  the following compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  and other barriers  and health and safety requirements  differences in intellectual property protections  currency fluctuations  economic instability  including inflation and interest rate fluctuations  risk of loss of our international assets due to political or economic instability  competition from foreign based suppliers  overlapping or differing tax structures  political or civil turmoil  and terrorist attacks on american companies abroad 
for fiscal years   and  international revenue excluding united states sales accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net sales 
we currently expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
several possible results of these attacks or future attacks could include supply chain disruptions and deferral of customer purchasing decisions  but other potential impacts cannot be predicted 
failure to manage the risks posed by our international operations  customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the ability to attract and retain key  highly qualified personnel  both technical and managerial  is critical to our success 
developing  manufacturing and marketing our products is a complex process and requires significant expertise to meet customers specifications 
competition for personnel  particularly qualified engineers  is keen 
the loss of a significant number of key personnel  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our intellectual property is important to our success 
we rely upon patents to protect our intellectual property 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements as needed and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we have been granted a total of united states and foreign patents 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
such infringement claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
a third party claiming infringement may also obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  or breach of non disclosure obligations  or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition
