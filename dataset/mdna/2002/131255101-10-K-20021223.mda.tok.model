item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in fiscal the company adopted a formal plan to dispose of the wholesale operations that had been a part of its wholesale and growing segment 
in fiscal the company decided to sell its turkey creek farms growing operation and discontinue the merchandise that it produced see note to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the following discussion of results of operations has been separated into i continuing operations and ii discontinued operations 
results of operations continuing operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  income from continuing operations before income taxes for was lower than it was for  primarily due to reduced gross profit 
sales declined from  indicating a small reduction in consumer demand for christmas merchandise  living plants and related gardening products 
while aggressive price discounting at christmas and late in the spring season had a positive effect on sales  it was not enough to offset a weaker start to the christmas season and the spring season 
same store sales sales in the retail stores that had been open for at least months at the beginning of fiscal declined 
the opening of new retail stores in the san antonio market in the fourth quarter did not provide enough additional sales to offset the decline that was experienced during the first three quarters 
gross profit declined from the decline was primarily attributable to i the decline in sales  and ii a corresponding decline in gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales 
gross margin declined to in from for for fiscal the company produced  at its own growing operations  a substantially higher proportion of the plants to be sold by its retail stores 
when same store sales declined  the company was left with unsold plants at its retail stores and growing operations  which had to be addressed 
the disposal of those plants was done partially through promotions at the retail stores  where consumer prices were sharply reduced  and by disposing of some unsold plants at the growing operations 
operating expenses increased 
the increase was primarily attributable to the opening of retail stores in the san antonio market 
occupancy expenses increased 
the increase was primarily attributable to the opening of retail stores in the san antonio market 
advertising expenses decreased 
the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced use of media other than newspapers and radio 
depreciation and amortization decreased 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures over the past several fiscal years  which resulted in an increased amount of assets becoming fully depreciated 
interest expense decreased 
the decrease was primarily attributable to i lower amounts of long term debt  ii lower seasonal borrowings under the revolving line of credit  iii lower interest rates 
interest income increased 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased amounts of cash and cash equivalents 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  sales declined from strong sales during the spring season were not enough to offset slower sales during the fall and winter seasons  which saw consumer demand for nursery products reduced due to unfavorable weather for gardening 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to in from for the gross margin was the highest in the company s history  a result of strong sales that kept stock loss and markdowns to a minimum 
the gross margin was more consistent with the gross margin of  which was achieved under similar market conditions 
operating expenses decreased 
the decrease was primarily the result of fewer bonuses paid due to the reduction in income from continuing operations for compared to occupancy expenses decreased by

the real properties added in the cornelius acquisition are company owned instead of leased 
occupancy expenses do not include the depreciation and amortization or interest expenses related to the cost of company owned facilities 
advertising expenses increased 
the increase was primarily due to increased newspaper and radio advertising done to stimulate consumer demand during the spring season 
depreciation and amortization was flat  with a increase 
interest expense increased  primarily due to increased seasonal borrowings under the company s revolving credit lines 
interest income decreased  due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents maintained during the year 
discontinued operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  sales decreased 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the october sale of the wld wholesale operations to an unrelated third party 
the turkey creek farms operation was a wholesale operation for all of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  and was a growing operation that sold only to the company s retail stores for the last quarters of fiscal total turkey creek sales for fiscal and fiscal were about the same 
gross profit decreased  primarily because substantially more inventory was grown at the turkey creek farms growing operation in than was sold to the company s retail stores 
approximately million of that inventory was written off and charged to cost of goods sold when the company decided to sell the turkey creek farms growing operation and discontinue the merchandise that it produced 
expenses decreased  primarily attributable to the october sale of the wld wholesale operations to an unrelated third party 
loss before income taxes was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increased loss was primarily attributable to the aforementioned inventory write down at the turkey creek farms growing operation in year ended september  compared with year ended september  sales decreased 
the decrease in sales was primarily attributed to continued pressure from lower cost wholesalers 
gross margin declined from for fiscal to for fiscal the decline was a result of the substantial decline in sales which caused excessive quantities of inventory that had to be marked down to lower of cost or market 
expenses declined 
the decline was a result of reduced expenses needed to support the reduced volume of sales 
the aforementioned factors caused the loss before income taxes to increase from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were  for fiscal  compared to cash flows used for operating activities of  for fiscal the improvement was primarily attributed to i an income tax refund of approximately million was received in fiscal  whereas in fiscal the company made income tax payments of approximately million  ii an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows used for investing activities decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the decrease was attributable to the company s continued curtailment of capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows used for financing activities were  for fiscal compared to cash flows used for financing activities of  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the net repayment of  owed under the revolving line of credit arrangement during fiscal the company has improved its liquidity position at september  by i reducing notes payable and long term debt by approximately million  and ii increasing cash and cash equivalents by million 
the company s business is seasonal  and it relies on its revolving line of credit arrangement to provide working capital during seasons of lower sales volumes 
typically  the company borrows from the revolving line of credit during the quarter ending march  and repays those borrowings quickly during the spring selling season included in the quarter ending june continued availability of funds from the revolving line of credit depends upon the company s continued compliance with its loan covenants 
at september  the company was in compliance with all of its loan covenants 
the company does not anticipate any problem in meeting its capital requirements or staying within the requirements of its loan covenants during fiscal contractual obligations and commitments as of september  the company had the following contractual obligations amounts in thousands fiscal year ending september thereafter totals long term debt including current portion   future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases       preferred stock with mandatory redemption provisions   totals        carrying amount of  as of september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some assets and liabilities by their nature are subject to estimates and assumptions 
for the company  those assets and liabilities include o inventories  o deferred income taxes  o property and equipment  o goodwill  o accrued expenses 
inventories the company values its inventories using the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
the company conducts physical inventories three times each year december  june and september 
the company s retail inventories turn over several times each year  therefore  the cost of each inventory item is approximately the same as its current replacement cost 
merchandise that is considered to have declined in quality is marked down to estimated net realizable value on a regular basis 
the physical inventories are taken at retail prices and adjusted to cost using sampling techniques that determine a markup percentage for each merchandise category in each market area 
the company s growing inventories turn over more slowly than the retail inventories  and items continue to grow and absorb costs until they are sold 
at each physical inventory  the accumulated cost of growing inventories is compared to published wholesale prices from competing growers on a gallon equivalent basis  with allowance for the estimated costs of disposal of such inventories 
the growing inventories are then recorded at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  merchandise that is considered to have declined in quality is marked down to estimated net realizable value on a regular basis 
deferred income taxes as of september  and the company has recorded a valuation allowance of for its deferred tax assets on the weight of available evidence at those balance sheet dates 
the primary factor in not providing for a valuation allowance is the expectation that future taxable income and the reversal of temporary differences will be sufficient for the company to realize the deferred tax assets 
such estimate could change in the future based on the occurrence of one or more future events 
property and equipment the company reevaluates the propriety of the carrying amounts of its properties as well as the amortization periods when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
as of september  and management believes that no impairment has occurred and that no reduction of the estimated useful lives is warranted 
goodwill the company has assessed the recoverability of its goodwill by determining whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life could be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  has been measured based on the projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill could be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
management believes that no impairment has occurred 
as discussed below  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  and will no longer amortize goodwill 
accrued expenses the company routinely accrues for various costs and expenses for which it has received goods or services  but for which it has not been invoiced 
typically  accrued expenses include such items as salaries and related taxes  bonuses  and sales and use taxes for which amounts are readily determinable and significant estimates are not necessary 
property taxes are estimated and accrued based on the amounts paid for such taxes for the previous year  until a new tax bill is received 
various other expenses are accrued from time to time before an invoice is rendered based on the estimated costs of those goods or services

statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which has been superceded by statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  upon adoption 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted statement as of october   and will no longer amortize goodwill 
statement will also require  upon adoption of statement  that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassification in order to conform to the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  statement will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but not later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of operations  effective as of the first quarter of fiscal as of october  the company has unamortized goodwill in the amount of  that is subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was   and  for the fiscal years ended september   and because of the extensive effort that will be needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s consolidated financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

statement nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
it significantly reduces an entity s ability to recognize a liability for future expenses related to a restructuring

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not enter into transactions designed to mitigate such market risks  nor does the company enter into any transactions in derivative securities for trading or speculative purposes 
as of september   the company had no foreign exchange contracts or options outstanding 
the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing a the amount of variable rate long term debt with b the amounts due under long term leases  which typically have fixed rental payments that do not fluctuate with interest rate changes 
for its variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at september  the company had variable rate long term debt of million  out of total long term debt of million 
holding other variables  such as debt levels  constant  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be expected to have an estimated impact on income before income taxes and cash flows for next year of approximately  for the variable rate long term debt
