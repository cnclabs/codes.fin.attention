item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the company s results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years 
this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables through included with this discussion and analysis 
disclosure of certain types of financial activies  arrangements and transactions certain types of financial activities and financial arrangements have received heavy scrutiny in the media in recent months 
accordingly  the company desires to make the following disclosures 
throughout each of the three years ended december  o the company has not had any form of involvement with any special purpose entities spe s 
o the company has not had a material ownership interest in any unconsolidated subsidiaries or partnerships 
o the company has not had any synthetic or capital leases 
o the company has not entered into any sale leaseback transactions 
o the company has not been a party to any non exchange traded contracts 
o the company has not been a party to any asset securitization activities 
o the company has not engaged in any on balance sheet or off balance sheet derivatives transactions required to be accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company s related party transactions for the same three year period have been limited to loans made to executive officers and directors in the ordinary course of business and in connection with the company s stock repurchase program in place in  the company repurchased a block of stock from a director at fair market value 
at december   the company has loans outstanding to executive officers and directors and to their associates totaling approximately million 
these loans were made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other non related borrowers 
management does not believe these loans involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features 
the million in outstanding related party loans represents less than of the company s total loan portfolio 
the company has never charged off a loan to a related party 
critical accounting policies due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved  the company has identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to the company s financial statements 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses 
this model has two components 
the first component involves the estimation of losses on loans defined as impaired loans 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the estimated valuation allowance is the difference  if any  between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that the company expects to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate  or in the case of a collateral dependent loan  the fair value of the collateral 
the second component of the allowance model is to estimate inherent losses for all loans not considered to be impaired loans 
first  loans that have been risk graded by the company as having more than standard risk but are not considered to be impaired are assigned estimated loss percentages generally accepted in the banking industry 
loans that are classified by the company as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type  and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type  based on the historical losses  current economic conditions  and operational conditions specific to each loan type 
the reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans 
this becomes the company s allocated allowance 
in addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model  management of the company also evaluates other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  net loan growth information  nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data 
based on this additional analysis  the company may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses 
this additional amount  if any  is the company s unallocated allowance 
the sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on the books of the company and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  operational  or other conditions change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for further discussion  see nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience under analysis of financial condition and changes in financial conditions 
discussion regarding impact of accounting methods used in mergers and acquisitions the years ended december  and were both significantly impacted by merger and acquisition activity  as discussed below 
the merger and acquisition activities for each year were recorded using different methods of accounting 
the different methods of accounting impacted the financial information presented in this form k in different ways 
as previously noted  in the company completed the merger acquisition of first savings bancorp  inc  which just prior to the merger date had total assets equaling of the company s total assets and had more shareholders equity than the company 
because this merger was accounted for under pooling of interests accounting  the financial reporting rules required that the company restate all historical financial results by retroactively combining the past results that each company achieved separately and presenting them as the company s historical financial results as if the two companies had always operated together 
therefore  except in specifically noted circumstances  there is no incremental impact to the company s financial information presented herein that can be discerned as a result of the acquisition of first savings 
the company s four acquisitions in see discussion below were all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires that the assets and liabilities acquired be reflected as part of the company s assets and liabilities as of the date of the acquisition 
therefore  the incremental impact of each of the acquisitions is more evident 
other significant differences in pooling of interests accounting and purchase accounting relate to the treatment of certain merger expenses and the method of recording the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity  as discussed in the following two paragraphs 
in accordance with pooling of interests accounting  all merger costs eg attorney fees  investment banker fees  accounting fees  employment contract payments related to the first savings acquisition were recognized as expense in the income statement 
conversely  purchase accounting requires that the direct costs related to a merger be treated as part of the purchase price of the acquisition  and therefore all such direct merger costs were effectively capitalized and increased the amount of goodwill recorded in each purchase transaction 
in accordance with pooling of interests accounting  the company recorded the acquisition of first savings using the historical cost basis for all of first savings assets and liabilities 
the excess of the assets over liabilities recorded ie first savings shareholders equity was added to the shareholders equity of the company 
the value of the stock that the company issued as merger consideration was not considered in the accounting entries  and therefore under pooling of interests accounting  no intangible assets were recognized 
under the purchase accounting method used for the company s acquisitions  the company valued all assets and liabilities of the acquired entities at their fair market value 
because for each of the company s acquisitions  the value of the consideration paid exceeded the net fair market value of its assets less its liabilities  intangible assets were recorded for the differences between the two 
merger and acquisition activity during and  the company completed several acquisitions and had one branch divestiture 
the company s acquisitions completed during were as follows a salisbury branch purchase on december   the company completed the purchase of a branch of first union national bank located in salisbury  north carolina 
the company assumed the branch s million in deposits and million in loans 
an intangible asset of million was recorded in connection with this acquisition 
b insurance agency acquisitions on may   the company completed the purchase of two insurance agencies aberdeen insurance realty company and hobbs insurance and realty company 
both agencies were located in moore county and specialized in placing property and casualty insurance coverage for individuals and businesses in the moore county area 
in completing the acquisition  the agencies were merged into first bank insurance services  inc approximately  shares of company stock were issued in connection with the acquisition of the two agencies 
an intangible asset of  was recorded in connection with the acquisition 
c century bancorp  inc on may   the company completed the purchase of century bancorp  inc century 
century was the holding company for home savings  inc  ssb  a one branch savings institution located in thomasville  nc 
century had total assets of million  total loans of million  and total deposits of million 
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  the company issued approximately  shares of common stock and paid cash of approximately million to century shareholders in exchange for all shares of century outstanding 
an intangible asset of million was recorded in connection with this acquisition 
d robeson and scotland counties branch purchase on march   the company completed the purchase of four branches from first union national bank with aggregate deposits of approximately million and aggregate loans of approximately million 
the four branches acquired were in lumberton  pembroke  st 
pauls all located in robeson county  nc  and laurinburg scotland county  nc 
total intangible assets of million were recorded in connection with the purchase 
see the section entitled current accounting matters below and notes r and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding intangible assets and their amortization under prior and new accounting standards 
as discussed above  each of the above transactions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the following table presents a summary of the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the purchases described above robeson and insurance scotland assets acquired salisbury branch agencies century counties branches total in millions cash securities loans  gross allowance for loan losses property  plant and equipment other total assets acquired liabilities assumed deposits borrowings other total liabilities assumed value of cash paid and or stock issued to stock holders of acquiree n a n a intangible assets recorded there are many factors that the company considers when evaluating how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates in the form of a purchase price comprised of cash and or stock for a whole company purchase or a deposit premium in a branch purchase 
most significantly  the company compares expectations of future earnings per share on a stand alone basis with projected future earnings per share assuming completion of the acquisition under various pricing scenarios 
significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate  the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized  and the interest rate earned lost on the cash received paid 
in addition to the earnings per share comparison  the company also considers other factors including but not limited to marketplace acquisition statistics  location of the candidate in relation to the company s expansion strategy  market growth potential  management of the candidate  potential integration issues including corporate culture  and the size of the acquisition candidate 
the generally higher amounts of intangible assets recorded relative to assets and deposits acquired in the branch purchases shown above compared to the century acquisition are primarily a result of the branches having a higher relative earnings stream  due largely to having a higher mix of transaction oriented deposit accounts that carried low interest rates and high potential for service charge income 
the lone acquisition during was the september  merger acquisition of first savings bancorp  inc the holding company for first savings bank of moore county  ssb collectively referred to as first savings 
each share of first savings stock was exchanged for shares of the company s stock  resulting in the company issuing approximately  shares of stock to complete the transaction 
at june   first savings had total assets of million  with loans of million and deposits of million 
to gain federal reserve approval for the merger with first savings  the company was required to divest the first savings bank branch located in carthage  nc 
this branch was sold to another north carolina community bank in a transaction that was completed in november at the time of the divestiture  the carthage branch had approximately million in total deposits and million in total loans 
the sale of the branch resulted in a net gain of the company did not complete any acquisitions or divestitures during there are no pending mergers  acquisitions or divestitures as of december  analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
discussion of nonrecurring items of income and expense as a part of its on going operations  the company periodically realizes income and expense that it considers to be outside of its day to day operations 
these types of income and expense include items such as merger related expenses  gains and losses from securities sales  loan sales  fixed assets  other real estate  and other items of a similar nature 
the company attempts to isolate nonrecurring items of income and expense for internal purposes and in communications with shareholders in order to present  on a pro forma basis  the company s earnings from its day to day operations  which some readers may find more meaningful than the amounts reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the past five years  only net income for the year included nonrecurring income or expense that impacted net income by more than 
the results of operations for the year were significantly impacted by the company s merger acquisition of first savings 
in connection with this acquisition  there were several material nonrecurring items of income and expense related to the transaction  as follows o  in expenses  after tax that were incurred in completing the merger 
these expenses consisted primarily of investment banker fees  attorney fees  employment contract payments  accountant fees  and early termination fees associated with vendor contracts 
these expenses were all recorded in the third quarter of o  in losses  after tax from sales of securities 
the merger with first savings increased the company s liability sensitive position 
to reduce the company s interest rate risk exposure  approximately million in securities were sold at a total loss of  the proceeds from the sale were first used to repay short term debt  with the remaining proceeds invested in investments with a shorter average life and a higher yield than the securities sold 
o  was recorded  after tax as a one time adjustment to the allowance for loan losses during the third quarter of this provision for loan losses was recorded in order to align the credit risk methodologies of the company and first savings 
o  was realized as a gain  after tax from the sale of the company s carthage branch during the fourth quarter of the sale of this branch was a regulatory requirement for approval of the merger with first savings 
the following table presents a summary of items for each of the past three years that are nonrecurring in nature 
the impact on net income and impact on diluted earnings per share columns reflect the after tax amount of the nonrecurring item at the blended federal and state tax rate

as a result of the acquisitions  the company s loans increased by million and deposits increased by million  whereas internally generated loan and deposit growth amounted to only million and million  respectively 
as a result of the incremental impact of these acquired loans and deposits  net interest income for the year increased despite a decrease in the net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets from in to in the provision for loan losses for amounted to  which is comparable to the recurring provision for loan losses of  recorded in the amount excludes the one time  acquisition related provision previously discussed 
the slightly lower provision in compared to the recurring provision was a result of lower net internal loan growth in in  the company s net internal loan growth amounted to million compared to million in an increase in nonperforming assets during increased what otherwise would have been an even lower level of provision for loan losses in the incremental impact of the acquisitions also contributed significantly to the increase in noninterest income increase on a recurring basis and the increase in noninterest expenses increase on a recurring basis from the amounts recorded in also increasing noninterest income in were increased fees earned from presold mortgages  which benefited from the low interest rate environment  and the introduction of a deposit product which  for a fee  allows checking account customers to overdraw their deposit account 
the company s income taxes increased from  in to  in the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate for of was lower than the effective tax rate in  primarily due to nondecuctible merger related expenses incurred in that had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate 
overview compared to net income for the year ended december  amounted to  a decrease from the  recorded for the net income amounted to basic earnings per share of  a decrease from the basic earnings per share reported for diluted earnings per share for amounted to  an decrease from the reported for as discussed above  net income for was significantly impacted by the merger with first savings

in  loans grew by and deposits grew by 
additionally from january  to december   the company s loans grew by a total of and deposits increased by 
the effect of recognizing the net interest income on a full twelve months of the loan and deposit growth  as well as the incremental impact of the growth  resulted in an increase in net interest income of in compared to partially offsetting the effects of the loan and deposit growth on net interest income was a slight decrease in the company s net interest margin from in to in the company s provision for loan losses amounted to  in compared to  in as noted above  a provision for loan losses of  was recorded at the time of the merger with first savings to align the credit risk methodologies of the two companies 
excluding this one time provision  the provision for loan losses amounted to  in  a increase over the  recorded for this increase in the provision for loan losses was consistent with the higher loan growth experienced in compared to in  loans outstanding increased by million compared to net loan growth of million in asset quality indicators remained strong in reported noninterest income for was  compared to  reported for noninterest income for was significantly impacted by the merger with first savings as a result of losses from securities sales that were executed to reposition the company s bond portfolio  as well as a gain realized from the sale of a branch that was required to be divested to gain regulatory approval 
recurring noninterest income  which excludes the merger related items discussed above  as well as other gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  increased  or  during  from  in to  in the increase in core noninterest income was associated with the general growth of the company 
reported noninterest expense for amounted to  compared to  for the year included  in merger expenses incurred in connection with the merger with first savings 
excluding the merger related expenses  noninterest expense amounted to  an increase from the increase in noninterest expense was also associated with the general growth of the company 
the company s income taxes decreased from  in to  in the decrease in income tax expense was a result of lower income before income taxes  which was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate that was caused by the nondeductibility of certain merger related expenses 
net interest income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in there are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income recorded by the company growth in loans and deposits  and the company s net interest margin 
in both and  net interest income was positively impacted by higher amounts of average loans and deposits outstanding and was negatively impacted by lower net interest margins 
table illustrates that the change in the average volume of loans and deposits was the predominant factor in the higher amounts of net interest income realized by the company in and in  the average amount of loans outstanding increased and the average amount of deposits outstanding increased 
in  the average amount of loans outstanding grew by  while the average amount of deposits increased by 
as previously noted  in most of the company s loan and deposit growth was achieved in corporate acquisitions  whereas in all of the loan and deposit growth was generated internally 
the effects of the increases in average loans and deposits on taxable equivalent net interest income in both and were partially offset by a narrowing of the company s interest rate spread in both years see table the company s net interest margin net yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points to in compared to s net interest margin of was basis points lower than the margin realized in the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities also declined  with a decrease of basis points in to 
s interest rate spread of was basis points lower than the realized in a competitive banking environment  including several markets in which the company competes with de novo banks aggressively attempting to gain market share  is partially responsible for the lower interest margins in and there were two other significant factors that contributed to the lower net interest margin realized in the significant rate cuts initiated by the federal reserve board and the incremental impact on the net interest margin from the company s acquisitions 
in  the company s interest rate spreads were negatively impacted by the federal reserve board cutting interest rates times totaling basis points 
although at january  the company had more interest sensitive liabilities than interest sensitive assets subject to repricing within twelve months  the company s interest sensitive assets repriced sooner generally the day following the interest rate cut and by a larger percentage generally by the same number of basis points that the federal reserve discount rate was decreased than did the company s interest sensitive liabilities that were subject to repricing 
the company s primary interest sensitive liabilities at january  in the twelve month horizon consisted of the following savings  now  and money market deposits  and time deposits 
interest rates paid on savings  now and money market deposits are set by management of the company  and although the interest rates on these accounts were decreased by the company within days of each of the federal reserve rate cuts  it was not possible to reduce the interest rates by the full amount of the federal reserve cuts due to competitive considerations and the already relatively low rates paid on these types of accounts 
interest rates paid on time deposits are generally fixed and not subject to automatic adjustment 
when time deposits mature  the company has the opportunity  at the customers discretion  to renew the time deposit at a rate set by the company 
because time deposits that are interest sensitive in a twelve month horizon mature throughout the twelve month period  any change in the renewal rate will only affect a portion of the twelve month period 
also  although changes in interest rates on renewing time deposits generally track rate changes in the interest rate environment  the company was not been able to decrease rates on renewing time deposits during by the corresponding decreases in the federal reserve discount rate because of the competitive pressures in the company s market 
another negative factor affecting the company s net interest margin in was the impact of the company s acquisitions  especially the march acquisition of four branches and the may acquisition of century 
the march acquisition of four branches from first union resulted in the company receiving million in cash 
the company was not able to immediately redeploy the cash received into a mix of higher yielding investments and loans consistent with the company s historic asset mix  and therefore the company s net interest margin was and continues to be negatively impacted 
the company acquired century in may because of century s higher mix of single family mortgage loans and time deposits which are generally the lowest yielding type of loan and highest rate type of deposit  the net interest margins earned on these acquired loans and deposits was lower than the company s historic margins 
another factor that affects the company s net interest margin is its reliance on time deposits greater than  and borrowings the two highest cost source of funds for the company 
the company s reliance on these funding sources decreased in after increasing in the increase in these high cost funds was achieved primarily to help fund high loan growth  comprising of the company s average total funding up from in  which negatively impacted net interest margins 
in  due largely to lower loan growth and the deposits assumed in the branch acquisitions  which had only a small percentage of time deposits greater than  and no borrowings  the percentage of time deposits greater than  and borrowings to total funding sources decreased to  positively impacting the net interest margin 
see additional information regarding net interest income on page in the section entitled interest rate risk 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth  an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company recorded provisions for loan losses of  in compared to  in and  in as noted earlier  in connection with the merger with first savings  a provision for  was recorded in in order to align the risk methodologies of the two merging companies 
excluding the merger related provision  the company s provision for loan losses was approximately less than the recurring provision of  the decrease in the recurring provision for loan losses was a result of significantly lower loan growth experienced 
net internal loan growth excludes loans assumed in acquisitions for amounted to million compared to million for an increase in nonperforming assets and net charge offs see discussion below during increased what would have been an otherwise lower level of provision for loan losses in the recurring provision of  excludes the merger related  one time adjustment was an increase from the  provision recorded in with asset quality remaining relatively stable during and  the variance in the provision for loan losses between the years was due primarily to higher loan growth experienced in compared to net new loan growth for amounted to million compared to million in  thus resulting in the higher provision in compared to see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the company s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in noninterest income for was significantly impacted by losses incurred from sales of securities that were partially offset by a gain realized from the sale of a branch 
both the securities losses and the branch sale gain were related to the merger acquisition of first savings see additional discussion below 
as shown in table  core noninterest income  which excludes gains and losses from sales of securities  loans  and other assets  as well as nonrecurrring items  amounted to  in  a increase from the  recorded in the core noninterest income of  was higher than the  recorded in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts in amounted to  a increase compared to the amount of  was higher than the amount of  the significant increase in service charges on deposit accounts realized in was primarily related to three events an increase in the company s service fee rate structure implemented in november  the company s acquisition of four branches on march  the branches purchased had a high level of transaction accounts non time deposits  million in total  which afforded the company the opportunity to earn deposit service charges  and the introduction of a product in august that charges a fee for allowing customers to overdraw their deposit account 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in compared to was generally proportional to the increase in average demand deposit accounts in compared to other service charges  commissions and fees amounted to  in  a increase from the  earned in the amount of  was higher than the  recorded in this category of noninterest income includes items such as safety deposit box rentals  check cashing fees  credit card and merchant income  and atm charges 
this category of income grew primarily because of increases in these activity related fee services as a result of overall growth in the company s total customer base  including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions 
fees from presold mortgages amounted to  in  a increase from the amount of  the amount was a decrease from the  recorded in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to two factors a higher level of mortgage loan refinancings caused by the lower interest rate environment  and the decision by the company to sell a higher percentage of single family home loan originations into the secondary market as opposed to holding them in the company s loan portfolio 
this strategy was implemented in an effort to shift the company s loan portfolio to having a higher percentage of commercial loans  which are generally shorter term in nature and have higher interest rates 
the decrease in fees from presold mortgages in compared to was primarily a result of the higher interest rate environment in compared to that slowed mortgage loan activity the average prime rate was in compared to in the average prime rate in was 
commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to  in   in and  in this line item includes commissions the company receives from three sources sales of credit insurance associated with new loans  in   in  and  in  commissions from the sales of investment  annuity  and long term care insurance products  in   in  and  in  and commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance  in and in and 
commissions from sales of credit insurance increased both years due to growth in the company s customer base 
commission from the sale of investment  annuity  and long term care insurance products have steadily increased over the past two years after the initial introduction of these products in late commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance began to be realized upon the may completion of the purchase of two insurance companies that specialized in such insurance 
data processing fees amounted to  in   in  and  in as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
these fees have increased as a result of an increase in data processing clients from one client to four clients in the past three years 
noninterest income not defined as core amounted to a net gain of  in  a net loss of  in  and a net gain of  in the net gain of  primarily relates to a  gain from the sale of two buildings that the company previously operated as branches that were consolidated with other branches in the same towns  and securities that were sold at a  gain 
the net losses of  recorded in primarily related to two merger related events a  loss resulting from a third quarter restructuring of the combined investment portfolio to reduce the company s liability sensitive position and an  gain realized from the fourth quarter sale of a branch that was required to be divested in order to gain regulatory approval 
net noncore noninterest income of  realized in primarily was comprised of immaterial gains and losses from sales of securities and loans 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  compared to  in and  in table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
the noninterest expenses recorded in included  in merger expenses 
these expenses consisted primarily of investment banker fees  attorney fees  employment contract payments  accountant fees  and early termination fees associated with vendor contracts 
these expenses were all recorded in the third quarter of excluding the merger expenses recorded in  the  in noninterest expenses recorded by the company in represented a increase from the recurring amount of  represented an increase from the  recorded in the increases in noninterest expenses in the past two years occurred in almost all categories and were due primarily to the company s growth 
in  the growth that resulted in additional noninterest expenses primarily related to the company s corporate acquisitions 
as previously noted  in the company purchased a total of branches  a savings institution with one branch  and two insurance agencies 
these acquisitions were primarily responsible for an increase in the company s branch network during from branches to branches and an increase in full time part time employees from at the beginning of the year to at december  in addition to the typical cash expenses associated with the growth  the company also recorded a total of  in non cash amortization expense in   more than in as a result of the million in acquisition related intangible assets recorded in see the section below entitled current accounting matters for a discussion of impending changes to the way the company will account for its intangible assets in the future  including ceasing amortization for a portion of the company s intangible assets 
the increase in noninterest expenses during excluding merger expenses was primarily a result of additional expense incurred in order to manage the company s internal growth 
the company incurred higher expenses throughout and in order to properly process  manage  and service the increase in loans and increase in deposits that occurred from the beginning of through the end of income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the increase in income tax expense in was a result of a increase in pretax income  which was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in was due to the effective tax rate being inflated because of the nondeductibility for tax purposes of certain merger expenses 
the decrease in tax expense in compared to was a result of a decrease in pretax income  which was partially offset by an increase in the company s effective tax rate from in to in caused by the aforementioned nondeductible merger expenses 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition overview over the past two years the company has achieved high increases in its levels of loans and deposits 
in  this growth was primarily related to corporate acquisitions  whereas in the growth was generated from internal operations 
in  the recessionary economy impacted the lower internal growth  whereas in economic expansion contributed to the balance sheet growth 
the following table presents information regarding the nature of the company s growth in and balance at balance at total percentage growth  in millions beginning internal growth from end of percentage excluding of period growth acquisitions period growth acquistions loans     deposits noninterest bearing     deposits savings  now  and money market     deposits time      deposits time      total deposits     loans    deposits noninterest bearing    deposits savings  now  and money market    deposits time     deposits time     total deposits    in  internal loan growth was substantially matched by a similar rate of internal deposit growth 
but in  although internal deposit growth was a strong million  or  it was far exceeded by the very high loan growth of million  or 
the company believes that the higher loan demand compared to deposit growth in the years leading up to was caused by several factors  including economic expansion coupled with lower consumer savings rates  increased competition for deposits  new types of competitors for deposits including brokerage houses and the internet  and the stock market being increasingly viewed as a savings vehicle 
the company believes the lower loan demand and deposit growth in were a result of the recessionary economy and the relatively lower interest rates paid on deposits as a result of the declining interest rate environment 
the higher loan growth experienced in compared to deposit growth resulted in a reduction of the company s liquidity 
as a result  in the company increased its use of borrowings  reduced its investment portfolio  and  in an effort to fund loan growth as much as possible with deposits  aggressively priced large time deposits 
the increased use of borrowings and large time deposits negatively impacted the company s net interest margin  as previously discussed 
the approximately million in net cash and securities that the company received in connection with its acquisitions served to improve liquidity 
the impact of the assets acquired in the corporate acquisitions  along with the significant amount of intangible assets recorded  served to reduce the company s capital ratios when compared to however  all three regulatory capital ratios remain significantly above the minimum regulatory thresholds 
the company s asset quality ratios were very strong during the four years leading up to in  although asset quality ratios for the company remain in line with peers  the ratios for are less favorable than in prior years 
the negative change in asset quality indicators is a result of the generally recessionary economy that has caused an increase in delinquencies and bankruptcies  as well as one large credit that was placed on nonaccrual status in the first quarter of in the years leading up to  the company s market area  the central piedmont region of north carolina  had a healthy economy  with low unemployment and a low business failure rate 
during  the economy in this area  as well as the rest of the nation  slowed 
in the second half of  there were announcements of corporate bankruptcies  layoffs and plant closings in the company s market area 
while the company does not believe it has any direct exposure to the companies involved  there was  and continues to be in  an indirect negative impact on the company s overall customer base and local economy related to these events 
the company does not participate in large syndicated credits that have resulted in large credit losses at several other north carolina based banks 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the variances in the percentages from to reflect the effects of the company s acquisitions during  as internal growth  as noted above  did not materially impact the company s balance sheet 
the total growth in deposits of million exceeded the million in total loan growth  which resulted in net loans to total assets decreasing from at year end to at year end  and deposits to total assets increasing from to over the same period 
the company assumed million in net cash related to the acquisitions which was not fully reinvested in securities or loans  resulting in the percentage of short term investments to total assets increasing from to 
a slight decrease in the dollar amount of total securities outstanding coupled with the significant increase in the company s total assets had the effect of reducing the percentage of total securities to total assets decreasing from to at december  and  respectively 
the variances in the percentages for compared to reflect the high loan and deposit growth experienced by the company 
the million in net loan growth in increased the company s loans to total assets from to 
a portion of the loan growth was funded with proceeds from securities maturities  which along with the sale of million in securities in the third quarter of most of the proceeds of which were not reinvested in securities  resulted in the percentage of total securities to total assets decreasing from at year end to at year end the million in deposit growth in resulted in the company s deposits to total assets amounts increasing from to 
as previously noted  the majority of the company s deposit growth occurred in time deposits 
time deposits of  or more as a percentage of total assets increased from to in while other time deposits increased from to during the same period 
borrowings at december  were significantly affected by the company s yk plan in which borrowings in excess of normal liquidity needs were obtained as a contingency in the event of high customer withdrawals which did not occur 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
the investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits 
total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
although the total amount of the company s securities did not change materially from december  to december   upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company transferred on january   as permitted by the standard upon its adoption  held to maturity securities with an amortized cost of approximately million to the available for sale category at fair value 
the decrease in total securities at year end compared to was primarily due to the sale of million in securities at a loss of million discussed earlier  most of which was not reinvested into securities  but rather used to pay down debt and invested in overnight investments 
in addition  a portion of the securities portfolio that matured during the year was used to fund loan growth 
over the past three years  the primary variance in the mix of the securities portfolio has been a shift from us government agency debt to mortgage backed securities 
us government agencies as percentage of total securities decreased from to to at december   and  respectively  while mortgage backed securities increased from to to at each of the same period ends 
the majority of the company s us government agency debt securities were issued by the federal home loan bank and carry one maturity date  often with an issuer call feature  while the mortgage backed securities have been primarily issued by freddie mac and fannie mae and vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of home mortgage loans 
over the past two years  in an effort to enhance yield  while at the same time managing interest rate exposure  the company has invested more heavily in mortgage backed securities than us government agencies 
additionally  as noted in investment policy and procedures in item i above  during the company s board of directors approved the purchase of corporate bonds  not to exceed of the securities portfolio 
at december   the company s investment in corporate bonds amounted to million  which was primarily comprised of trust preferred securities issued by other north carolina bank holding companies 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were cmo s with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  the cmo s that the company has invested in are substantially all early tranche pieces of the cmo 
at december   net unrealized gains of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale  compared to a net unrealized gain of  at december  and a net unrealized loss of  at december  the increase in the unrealized gain position at december  compared to december  is a result of the lower interest rate environment in effect at the end of approximately half of the favorable  change experienced in the unrealized gain loss position of the available for sale portfolio in compared to was due to the company realizing million in losses in connection with the merger related security sale  while the other half was due to an increase in the value of the bond holdings as a result of the lower interest rate environment in effect at the end of management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  was more than the carrying value at december  by  and less than the carrying value at december  by  management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed and other amortizing securities are shown maturing in the time periods consistent with their estimated lives based on expected prepayment speeds 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds  the maturity date for all other non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities  was years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was at december  the expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities  was years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
other than the collateralized mortgage obligations previously discussed  the company owned no securities considered by regulatory authorities to be derivative instruments 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
the loan portfolio is the largest category of the company s earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans  real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  and consumer loans 
the company restricts virtually all of its lending to its county market area  which is located in the central piedmont region of north carolina  and one county in virginia 
the diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment 
loans outstanding increased million  or  to million during approximately million of the growth was from net internal loan growth  while million was assumed in acquisitions 
the most significant acquisition contributing to the loan growth was the may acquisition of century bancorp  which had million in loans outstanding on the date of the acquisition 
the great majority of century s loans were family home loans 
loans increased by million  or  in to million from the million held at december  the majority of the and loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or  in and million  or  in of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
over the years  the company s loan mix has remained fairly consistent  with real estate loans mortgage and construction comprising approximately of the loan portfolio  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans comprising  and consumer installment loans comprising approximately of the portfolio 
at december   million or of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in loans secured by liens on other types of real estate 
the company s million in real estate mortgage loans can be further classified as follows o million  or of total loans  are traditional residential mortgage loans in which the borrower s personal income is the primary repayment source 
o million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from a commercial business for repayment 
o million  or of total loans  are personal consumer installment loans in which the borrower has provided residential real estate as collateral 
o million  or of total loans  are real estate construction loans 
o million  or of total loans  are home equity loans 
o million  or of total loans  are primarily dependent on cash flow from agricultural crop sales 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the company s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and  respectively  as of december  the company intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and other real estate 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the placing of loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
the variances in nonperforming loans over the past two years has been primarily due to changes in nonaccrual loans  as restructured loans have not changed significantly 
the increase in nonperforming loans for compared to is primarily attributable to four loans to the same borrower totaling million at december  that were placed on nonaccrual status during the first quarter of as a result of the borrower having liquidity problems 
in addition to the million in loans on nonaccrual status  the company has an additional  in loans to this same borrower at december  that do not meet the company s criteria for nonaccrual status 
in addition to and apart from this single large relationship  the company has noted an increase in bankruptcies and other financial difficulties among its borrowers  which the company attributes to the negative effects of the recessionary economy  leading to a total of loans being on nonaccrual status at december  compared to loans at december  the decrease in nonaccrual loans from december  to december  was primarily a result of a  loan that was paid off during the second quarter of  and the removal of substantially all of the nonaccrual loans on the books at december  by reason of payoff  charge off  foreclosure  or return to accrual status  with a lower amount of loans being placed on nonaccrual status during if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in   and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that  in management s opinion  have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above  management believes that an estimated million of large loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at december  had the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
other real estate includes foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties 
other real estate has not varied materially at any of the past three year ends  amounting to  at december    at december   and  at december  other real estate represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the company s management has reviewed recent appraisals of its other real estate and believes that their fair values  less estimated costs to sell  equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the company considers the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
see the heading critical accounting policies above for further discussion 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions 
the company uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the company s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans coverage ratio amounted to at december   compared to at december  and at december  the change in the coverage ratio is inversely proportional to the level of nonperforming loans at each period end 
due to the secured nature of virtually all of the company s loans that are on nonaccrual status  the variance in the coverage ratio is not necessarily indicative of the relative adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased to  at december  from  at december  and  at december  the increase in the amount of the allocated allowance is consistent with the increase in total loans outstanding the increase in the allocated amount during was primarily due to loan growth and the company segregating and assigning higher reserve percentages to particular loan types that were identified during as having inherently higher risk 
these additional risk characteristics were noted by management as a part of its ongoing analysis and review of its loan portfolio and historical charge off experience  and did not result from any deterioration of the portfolio which developed during in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially in compared to the general increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses through was consistent with overall loan growth  while the decrease in was primarily associated with the higher risk percentages assigned to a portion of the loan portfolio discussed above 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the increases to the allowance for loan losses related to normal provisions  the increase in the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses during was also affected by  in increases that the company recorded to provide for loans assumed in corporate acquisitions 
approximately  of the  related to million in mostly consumer loans assumed in the march and december branch acquisitions  while  related to the century acquisition 
the  addition related to century represented the book value of century s allowance for loan losses on the date of the acquisition 
the company s net loan charge offs were approximately  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and respectively 
a rise in consumer bankruptcy filings is primarily responsible for the increase in net charge offs 
deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits grew to million in  an increase of million  or  compared to growth of million or in as previously discussed  most of the company s deposit growth in was related to its corporate acquisitions  which increased deposits a total of million when comparing the beginning of the year to the balance at the end of the year  compared to internal growth of million 
the growth in average deposits occurred in all types of deposits  with each category experiencing an increase of at least 
the increases in the average amounts of non time deposits which include noninterest bearing deposits million increase  or  interest bearing demand deposits million increase  or  and savings deposits million increase  or were primarily due to the march acquisition of the four first union branches  the deposits of which were comprised of approximately million of those branches total deposits of non time deposits 
the increases in time deposits less than  million increase  or and time deposits greater than  million increase  or were primarily due to the remaining million in first union deposits  as well as million in time deposits assumed in the may century acquisition 
internal growth during of approximately for noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits contributed to the deposit growth in non time deposits 
internal growth in time deposits greater than  of million  or  contributed to the growth in this category  while a net decrease in internally generated time deposits less than  of million  or  partially negated the overall increase in this category 
in comparing to  average time deposits greater than  experienced the highest percentage growth of any of the deposit categories 
in  average time deposits greater than  increased million  or 
time deposits in denominations of less than  was the other major component of average deposit growth during  with growth of million  or  during the year 
the primary reason for the high growth within these categories of deposits was that the company began more competitively pricing time deposits in order to help fund the strong loan growth experienced in time deposits are generally more rate sensitive than the other categories of deposits  and thus can be more easily accumulated by more aggressively pricing their rates 
as of december   the company held approximately million in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of million 
table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
the company does not issue any time deposits through foreign offices  nor does the company believe that it holds any deposits by foreign depositors 
borrowings the company has three sources of borrowing capacity an approximately  line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  a  overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately  line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s frb discount window 
the company s line of credit with the fhlb totaling approximately  can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings  depending on the particular funding or liquidity need and is secured by the company s fhlb stock and a blanket lien on its one to four family residential loan portfolio 
at december   the company had million outstanding under this line of credit compared to million a year earlier 
the decrease in outstanding borrowings was due to million in maturities in see liquidity below for a maturity table of the company s borrowings 
any outstanding borrowings with the fhlb may be accelerated immediately by the fhlb in certain circumstances  including material adverse changes in the condition of the company or if the company s qualifying collateral amounts to less than times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
at december   the company s qualifying collateral amounted to times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
the company also has a correspondent bank relationship established that allows the company to purchase up to  in federal funds on an overnight  unsecured basis 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this line at december  or this line of credit was not drawn upon in there was insignificant use of this line during and with total interest expense incurred amounting to approximately  each year 
the company also has a line of credit with the frb discount window 
this line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the company s commercial  consumer and real estate portfolio excluding family 
based on the collateral owned by the company as of december   the available line of credit is approximately  this line of credit was established primarily in connection with the company s yk liquidity contingency plan and has not been drawn on since inception 
the frb has indicated that it would not expect lines of credit that have been granted to financial institutions to be a primary borrowing source 
the company plans to maintain this line of credit  although it is not expected that it will be drawn upon except in unusual circumstances 
average short term borrowings for each year presented were less than thirty percent of total shareholders equity at each period 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past five calendar years the company s net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in 
during that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of to a high of 
as discussed above under the heading net interest income  the company experienced downward pressure in on its net interest margin  primarily as a result of the significant decreases in the interest rate environment 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call 
as illustrated by this table  the company has million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced  and did not reprice during  coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that in the near term twelve months  net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates in fact  as discussed above under the heading net interest income  a declining interest rate environment during negatively impacted at least temporarily the company s net interest margin 
generally  when rates change  the company s interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change  while the company s interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change 
the net effect is that in the twelve month horizon  as rates change  the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities is substantially negated by the later and typically lower proportionate change these liabilities experience compared to interest sensitive assets 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s fixed rate assets and liabilities each have estimated fair values that are slightly higher than their carrying value 
this is due to the yields on these portfolios being higher than market yields at december  for instruments with maturities similar to the remaining term of the portfolios  due to the declining interest rate environment 
see additional discussion regarding net interest income  as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin in the section entitled net interest income above 
return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  return on assets  return on equity  and dividend payout ratio per basic share for the year were significantly impacted by the nonrecurring merger related charges discussed previously 
excluding nonrecurring items  return on assets  return on equity  and the dividend payout ratio for the year would have been  and  respectively 
liquidity the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
in addition to internally generated liquidity sources  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the following three sources an approximately million line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank  and an approximately million line of credit through the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window 
see the section above entitled borrowings for additional detail about these credit lines 
the company s on balance sheet liquidity improved during  primarily as a result of corporate acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisitions  the company received a net of million in cash and securities  million in loans  and million in deposits 
as a result  the company s loan to deposit ratio decreased from at december  to at december  additionally  the percentage of balance sheet assets that are generally regarded as being liquid consisting of cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  presold mortgages in process of settlement and securities increased from of total deposits and borrowings at december  to at december  in the years leading up to  the company s liquidity had steadily decreased  primarily as a result of strong growth in loans that was not matched by similar increases in deposits 
the company s loan to deposit ratio gradually increased from at december  to at december   and the level of liquid assets as a percent of deposits and borrowings had steadily declined from december  to at december  in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  that may or may not require future cash outflows 
the following table reflects the contractual obligations of the company outstanding as of december  payments due by period in thousands on demand or contractual less after obligations total than year years years years long term debt     operating leases total contractual cash obligations  excluding deposits     deposits     total contractual cash obligations  including deposits      the million in long term debt that matures in the after years column above has a call option whereby the lender the fhlb may call the debt in also as discussed above under the heading borrowings  any outstanding borrowings with the fhlb may be accelerated immediately by the fhlb in certain circumstances  including material adverse changes in the condition of the company or if the company s qualifying collateral amounts to less than times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
at december   the company s qualifying collateral amounted to times the amount of borrowings outstanding 
it has been the experience of the company that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits  thus not requiring any net cash outflow 
based on that assumption  management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations from normal operations 
the following table reflects other commercial commitments of the company outstanding as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total other commercial amounts less after commitments committed than year years years years credit cards    lines of credit and loan commitments      standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments      of the  in commitments related to credit cards and lines of credit at december    were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
additionally  as shown above  standby letters of credit of approximately  were outstanding at december  the company s exposure to credit loss for the aforementioned commitments in the event of nonperformance by the party to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
however  management believes that these commitments represent no more than the normal lending risk that the company commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the company plans to obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
the types of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations 
the company is not involved in any legal proceedings that  in management s opinion  could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the company 
off balance sheet derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company does not engage in off balance sheet derivatives activities 
at december  and at all times during years presented in this report  the company s management believes its liquidity sources  including unused lines of credit  were at an acceptable level and remained adequate to meet its operating needs

the company is regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve board fed and is subject to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the bank is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the north carolina office of the commissioner of banks 
the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the fed and fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company and the bank to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets tier i capital ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets total capital ratio of and  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale  less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company and the bank is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company and the bank  adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in fed and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company and the bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets leverage ratio of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the fed has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios as of december    and the company s regulatory capital ratios  while continuing to far exceed regulatory minimums  decreased significantly in as a result of the company s acquisitions  which increased assets and decreased tangible capital 
in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized 
the specific guidelines are as follows tier i capital ratio of at least  total capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
the bank s regulatory ratios are not materially different from the company s ratios  and thus exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at december   and see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses
