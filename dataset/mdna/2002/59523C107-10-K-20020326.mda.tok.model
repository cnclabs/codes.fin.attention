item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information all forward looking information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on management s current knowledge of factors  all with inherent risks and uncertainties  affecting mamsi s business 
mamsi s actual results may differ materially if these assumptions prove invalid 
significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are the possibility of increasing price competition in the company s service area 
the effect on the company due to a weaker economy 
the effect on the company due to the recent acts of terrorism and any future attacks 
the possibility that the company is not able to increase its market share at the anticipated premium rates 
the possibility of increased litigation  legislation or regulation such as the numerous class action lawsuits that have been filed against managed care companies and the pending initiatives to increase health care regulation that might increase regulatory oversight which  in turn  would have the potential for increased costs 
the inability to predict and control medical expenses due to increased utilization by the company s membership 
increased practitioner and pharmaceutical costs 
federal or state mandates that increase benefits or limit the company s oversight ability 
existing disputes under risk sharing arrangements  the company s ability to maintain and renew these arrangements  and any future disputes under such arrangements 
the possibility that the company is not able to negotiate new or renewal contracts with appropriate physicians  other health care practitioners  hospitals and facilities 
the list of significant risk factors is not intended to be exhaustive 
there may be other risk factors that would preclude the company from realizing the predictions made in the forward looking statements 
while the company may periodically update this discussion of risk factors  the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statement that may be made by or on behalf of the company prior to its next required filing with the securities and exchange commission 
discussion of mamsi s business and important accounting matters mamsi  through its owned subsidiary companies  is predominately in the business of selling various forms of health insurance 
in  of revenues were earned from the sale of health insurance products  mostly to employers who purchase health insurance for their employees 
since premium rates are generally fixed for a one year period  it is critical to the company s continued financial success that its prices are set at levels that will at least cover the next policy year s medical costs for members plus administrative costs to pay claims  provide member services  pay taxes  and cover other related costs 
this means that we have to carefully evaluate data and estimate both future utilization of medical services by our members and the cost of those services so that we can set premiums at adequate levels 
this is the single most important factor in our business 
very simply  if our medical expenses are greater than our premiums  we lose money 
while mamsi s business is somewhat complex from an insurance regulatory standpoint  its consolidated balance sheet and income statement are straightforward and the accounting policies and procedures that we use to produce them are reasonable and appropriate 
mamsi does not own any special purpose entities  does not have any complex or extraordinarily risky investments nor does it have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in fact  mamsi has almost no debt outstanding 
the buildings that the company owns and uses in its operations do not even have mortgages  they are owned free and clear 
the company s funds are held in cash or invested in money market accounts  tax exempt securities and other debt securities 
all of the bonds we own have investment ratings of a or better 
certain of our accounting policies are extremely important to the fair presentation of our results and financial position 
we think that the single most important accounting issue we have is the recording  at the end of each reporting period  of an adequate liability and corresponding expense for medical services that have been provided to our members but for which we have not yet received a bill 
this lag between date of service and date of billing is normal in the insurance business and the liability for these claims is called liability for incurred  but not reported claims ibnr 
the ibnr liability is included with medical claims payable in our balance sheet 
the determination of the company s ibnr is a fairly complex process 
the company employs its own actuary to aid in its determination 
the primary method we use to estimate ibnr is consistent from period to period and uses historical claims data to develop the historical relationship of how many claims dollars have been reported in any given month to what was received in total  once all claims were received 
this relationship gives us an indication of how much medical expense has been incurred in months for which we have not yet received all claims 
while we use a consistent method in developing our ibnr estimate  considerable judgment is required 
to the extent that we over or under estimate our ibnr at the end of any reporting period  the adjustment is included in the next period s results 
another important accounting policy relates to our risk sharing contracts 
certain of the company s larger vendors offer various forms of risk sharing or guarantees as a part of their contractual relationship with us 
these arrangements are not significant in relation to the company s financial statements with one exception  the company s risk sharing arrangement with its pharmacy benefits manager pbm 
the company s pbm is responsible for providing administrative and technical support as well as providing the ability to process pharmacy transactions on a real time basis 
the company s current pbm is merck medco managed care  llc merck 
as a part of its contract with us  merck agreed to a pharmacy cost guarantee related to fiscal year we are recording the amount due under this guarantee over the contract term of three years  which commenced january the total value of the guarantee we estimated for financial statement purposes is approximately million of which approximately million has been recorded in our financial statements as a reduction of medical expense over the first two years of the contract 
this amount is also reported in the balance sheets as a reduction of medical claims payable 
a dispute between merck and the company has arisen over this cost guarantee which is in binding arbitration 
while the company believes it has complied with the terms of its contract with merck  and that its financial statements are fairly stated  if the dispute is not resolved in the company s favor  all or part of the million might have to be written off and future amounts not yet recognized might never be recognized 
this in turn could increase the company s future medical expense more than currently anticipated  which would effect the company s overall profitability 
see note to the financial statements 
another accounting policy that is very important to the fair presentation of our financial results is the proper valuation of the company s accounts receivable 
the company bills the majority of its health insurance customers on a monthly basis 
the premium bill is typically sent out days in advance of the month being billed for  so that the company can receive the cash at the start of the month for which the insurance is being provided 
the vast majority of our customers pay in a timely fashion but some do not 
after some communication  we generally receive payment but we do not always collect what we are due 
this can happen for a variety of reasons such as customers having financial difficulties  disputes regarding the amount of the bill or a customer failing to notify us that they have obtained other health insurance 
to properly value the accounts receivable at its net realizable value we must determine an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces the gross amount of accounts receivable that are recorded  based on the bills sent  to the net amount that we actually think we will receive 
the allowance also reduces premium revenue by the same amount 
to determine how much to record as a reduction of the gross accounts receivable  we prepare an accounts receivable aging 
this aging segments the total accounts receivable balance by category as to when it was due to the company 
this allows us to evaluate how old our accounts receivable are 
we then prepare an evaluation based on historical collection percentages applied to various categories of accounts 
we also identify individual accounts that are unlikely to pay due to financial or other problems and analyze them individually 
the aforementioned analyses are then summarized and an allowance is developed and recorded 
the company applies this methodology on a consistent basis from period to period 
general during the three year period ended december   the company experienced growth in membership 
while membership in certain products continues to grow  other products have decreased when compared to the company has achieved its overall size by continually expanding its product lines which include point of service  small group  indemnity health  hybrid products and group term life and through expansion into new geographic markets 
premium rates during this time have increased  yet remain at competitive levels for the company s marketplace 
during  the company s consolidated operating margin showed improvement over the company achieved s results  in part  by implementing product price increases and reducing or eliminating membership in products or effectively terminating groups that had the potential for continued unprofitability 
the company anticipates that it will continue to increase premium rates during this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information above for a description of those risk factors 
the company generally receives a fixed premium amount per member per month while the majority of medical expenses are variable and significantly affected by spontaneous member utilization 
even with managed care controls  unusual medical conditions can occur  such as an outbreak of influenza or a higher than normal incidence of high cost cases such as premature births  complex surgeries  or rare diseases 
as a result  the company s quarterly results can be materially affected and irregular 
however  over the longer business cycle  the company believes that its managed care control systems  underwriting procedures when allowed and network of physicians and health care practitioners should result in continued profitability 
due to continued concern about privacy  the accountability of health insurers and hmos  and the cost and availability of health care coverage  legislation has been considered and is likely to be further considered by the united states congress and the legislatures of the states in which the company operates or may seek to operate 
in  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  public law  commonly called hipaa was enacted 
this bill established certain requirements for insurers  health maintenance organizations and erisa plans regarding eligibility rules for health care coverage 
the law also included administration simplification provisions to regulate and standardize information exchanges and establish standards for the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
the four key areas of administration simplification are transactions and code sets  unique identifiers  security  and privacy 
hhs has published final regulations on transactions and code sets and privacy and expects final regulations for unique identifiers and security in these rules will apply to insurers  health maintenance organizations  providers and erisa plans and will effect the business operations of these entities 
mlh  mamsi s hmos and homecall are in the process of assessing current procedures and developing plans to comply with the administration simplification provisions of hipaa 
the company believes it has sufficient internal resources to address those issues related to hipaa compliance 
if internal resources prove to be insufficient  the company will engage outside resources 
the statements in this paragraph regarding the future effects of hipaa are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information for a description of risk factors 
mamsi has two years plus two months from the effective date of the final regulations to comply 
state legislatures and the us congress continue to debate and consider legislation to amend civil tort law so as to expand enterprise liability to insurers  hmos and erisa plans as well as other health care reform initiatives 
neither congress nor any state legislature in the company s service area  with the exception of north carolina  has enacted laws that would expand an insurer s or hmo s liability in tort action 
states in the company s service area have enacted laws regarding the internal and external review of adverse utilization review decisions 
under these laws  persons covered by insurers or hmos subject to state regulation are given a right to seek a fast and fair review of these decisions  first internally by a medical director and then externally by an independent review organization and or a state regulator 
maryland  the district of columbia  virginia  north carolina  west virginia and pennsylvania have enacted such laws 
state legislatures are considering a variety of proposals to increase access to health care coverage 
this includes expanding the eligibility rules for the medicaid program and tax credits for the purchase of group or individual insurance 
the company expects that continued legislative scrutiny of health insurers and hmos may lead to additional legislative initiatives 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact of any federal or state restructuring of the health care delivery or financing systems  but such changes could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial condition of the company 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations the company s consolidated net income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased from in year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in earnings is attributable to an increase in premiums per member  a reduction in medical expenses as a percentage of health premium revenue medical care ratio  and a reduction in administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue administrative expense ratio 
the company has priced its health products competitively in order to increase its membership base and thereby enhance its strategic position in its market place 
the company currently has one of the largest hmo and managed care enrollments and also the largest network of contract providers of medical care in its service area which includes the entire states of maryland and delaware  the district of columbia  most counties and cities in virginia and certain areas of west virginia  north carolina and pennsylvania 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while an percent increase in average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
management believes that commercial health premiums should continue to increase over the next twelve months as the company continues to increase its commercial membership and as new and renewing groups are charged higher premium rates due to legislatively mandated benefit enhancements and general price increases initiated by the company 
this is a forward looking statement 
see forward looking information for a description of the risk factors that may affect health premiums per member 
the company has implemented increased premium rates across essentially all of its commercial products 
as the company s contracts are generally for a one year period  increased pricing generally cannot be initiated until a contract reaches its renewal date 
therefore  price increases are not implemented across the company s membership at the same time 
overall  commercial premium rate increases are expected to continue in in the range of to 
management believes that these rate increases may have the effect of slowing the company s future membership growth 
in addition  management reevaluated premium reimbursement rates with regard to its medicaid program 
effective may   the company transferred its membership in the virginia medicaid program to a non affiliated carrier 
therefore  as of may   the company ended its participation in any government entitlement health insurance program 
the company s future membership growth depends on several factors such as relative premium prices and product availability  future increases or decreases in the company s service area and increased competition in the company s service area 
the company s home health operations contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  reflecting a decrease in services provided to non affiliated companies and a write off of uncollectible accounts receivable in the amount of approximately million 
fee and other revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  life and short term disability products contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the medical care ratio decreased to percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the year ended december  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
the decrease in the medical care ratio is due to increased premiums per member combined with continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  continued activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage 
the ongoing initiatives should help to control the company s medical care ratio 
the medical expense trend is expected to be between and for the statements in this paragraph and the preceding paragraphs regarding future utilization rates  cost containment initiatives  total medical costs and trend and future increases in health premiums per member are forward looking statements 
see forward looking information above for a description of risk factors that may affect medical expenses per member and the medical care ratio 
the administrative expense ratio decreased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  management believes that the administrative expense ratio will be approximately in management s expectation concerning the administrative expense ratio is a forward looking statement 
the administrative expense ratio is affected by changes in health premiums and other revenues  development of the company s expansion areas and increased administrative activity related to business volume 
investment income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in the amount of investments 
the effective tax rate increased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  primarily due to the benefit from certain one time tax credits that were recognized in the net margin rate increased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the factors described above 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations the company s consolidated net income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased from 
in year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in earnings is attributable to an increase in premiums per member  a reduction in the medical care ratio  offset somewhat by an increase in administrative expense 
revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately million or percent over the year ended december  a percent increase in net average hmo and indemnity enrollment resulted in an increase of approximately million in health premium revenue while a percent increase in average monthly premium per enrollee  combined for all products  resulted in a million increase in health premium revenue 
the company s home health operations contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  reflecting an increase in services provided to non affiliated companies 
fee and other revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  life and short term disability products contributed million in revenue for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the medical care ratio decreased to percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the year ended december  on a per member per month basis  medical expenses increased percent 
the decrease in the medical care ratio is due to a combination of factors including continuing efforts by the company to implement product specific cost containment controls  continued activity in specialized subrogation areas and claims review for dual health coverage  the company s withdrawal from state medicaid programs  and also increased premiums per member 
the administrative expense ratio increased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  the administrative expense ratio is affected by changes in health premiums and other revenues  development of the company s expansion areas and increased administrative activity related to business volume 
investment income increased million primarily due to an increase in the amount of investments 
the effective tax rate decreased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in tax exempt income  the restructuring of certain operations to increase tax efficiency and the benefit from certain one time tax credits 
the net margin rate increased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s business is not capital intensive and the majority of the company s expenses are payments to physicians and health care practitioners  which generally vary in direct proportion to the health premium revenues received by the company 
although medical utilization rates vary by season  the payments for such expenses lag behind cash inflow from premiums because of the lag in provider billing procedures 
in the past  the company s cash requirements have been met principally from operating cash flow and it is anticipated that this source  coupled with the company s operating line of credit  will continue to be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements in the future 
the company s cash and investment securities increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the timing of medical expense payments which traditionally lag behind the receipt of increased premiums per member  cash received from the exercise of stock options and net income offset by the effect of treasury stock purchases 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december   principally due to the timing of customer payments and increases in membership 
prepaid expenses  advances and other increased from million at december  to million at december  due to an increase in working capital advances paid to maryland hospitals and the prepayment of insurance policies which cover the company s assets and business operations  offset by the decrease in income tax amounts paid in advance 
net property and equipment increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to build out and renovation costs associated with the purchase of facilities  for use in the company s operations  in late october medical claims payable increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to increased membership and an increase in medical expenses per member 
deferred premium revenue increased from million at december  to million at december  due to a change in contract period with the fehbp and an increase in cash payments received in advance of the premium coverage period 
additional paid in capital increased from million at december  to million at december  due to an additional million shares of the company s stock being placed into the sct  as well as an increase in the market value of the shares of the company s stock held in the sct 
the value of the sct increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the increase in the market value of the shares of the company s stock held in the sct  and the purchase of an additional million shares of the company s stock being placed into the sct offset by the exercise of employee stock options 
for financial reporting purposes  the sct is consolidated with mamsi 
the fair market value of the shares held by the sct is shown as a reduction to stockholders equity in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
all transactions between the sct and mamsi are eliminated 
the difference between the cost and fair value of common stock held in the sct is included in the consolidated financial statements as additional paid in capital 
treasury stock increased from million at december  to million at december  due to the purchase of  additional shares by the company at a total cost of  the company currently has access to total revolving credit facilities of million which are subject to annual renewal and collateral requirements  and are used to provide short term capital resources for routine cash flow fluctuations 
at december   the company s investment security balances used as collateral  which are parent company only investments  fell below the minimum collateral requirements thereby reducing the credit line availability to million 
in addition  at december   approximately million was drawn against these facilities  and approximately  in letters of credit were outstanding 
while no amounts have been drawn against these letters of credit  they reduce the company s credit line availability 
following is a schedule of the short term capital resources available to the company in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents   investment securities   working capital advances to maryland hospitals   total available liquid assets   credit line availability   total short term capital resources   the company believes that cash generated from operations along with its current liquidity and borrowing capabilities are adequate for both current and planned expanded operations 
the company s major business operations are principally conducted through its hmos and its insurance company 
hmos and insurance companies are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity and risk based capital  and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent corporation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   those subsidiaries of the company were in compliance with all minimum capital and exceeded all risk based capital requirements 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased an additional  shares of its common stock for a total cost of approximately million 
on december   approximately million of unspent authorization was available for future purchases 
during january  the company repurchased an additional  shares of its common stock for a total cost of approximately million 
on february   the board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program to begin immediately 
this authorization was in addition to the million of unspent funds carried forward from the september authorization
