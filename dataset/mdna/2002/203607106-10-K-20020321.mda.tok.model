these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements 
the following discussion is intended to facilitate an understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references in the discussion to financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
all financial results reflect the acquisition of first liberty bank corp 
first liberty in accordance with pooling of interest accounting  unless otherwise noted 
lastly  all references to peer banks  unless otherwise noted  pertain to a group of companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets based on data through september  the most recently available disclosure as provided by the federal reserve system 
net income and profitability net income and earnings per share diluted for the year ended december  were million and  off and  respectively  from the prior year 
these results include million in nonrecurring items associated with the company s three acquisitions in january  may  and november  which added billion in assets and increased its branch network by to locations 
included in these nonrecurring items are acquisition and other unusual costs as well as net security gains and loss on early retirement of long term debt 
s operating earnings  which exclude all nonrecurring items  were million down  while operating earnings per share diluted were off on more average shares outstanding 
cash operating earnings reached an all time high in of million  up from s level 
in addition to deducting nonrecurring items  cash operating earnings exclude the amortization of intangible assets  which represent premiums paid on acquisitions 
cash operating earnings per share diluted for all of were  a decrease of from these results reflect an additional  common shares issued in connection with the company s january whole bank purchase and million issued in the fourth quarter to support the mid november purchase of branches in western new york from fleetboston financial nyse fbf 
cash operating return on assets roa for was versus nominal operating roa at 
cash operating return on equity roe for the year was versus nominal operating roe at 
the difference between cash and nominal results reflects the contribution of the company s acquisitions on an economic basis  which excludes the non cash impact of amortizing the premiums paid for the acquisitions 
many analysts and investors consider cash results a better measure of core profitability and value created for shareholders than nominal results 
the primary factors explaining are explained in detail in the remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows o net interest income full tax equivalent basis increased or million due to a million increase in average earning assets 
average loans grew million while average investments rose million 
the growth in earning assets was funded by million more in average deposits and million more in average borrowings 
net interest margin decreased by basis points to on average  largely reflective of the impact of rapidly falling financial market interest rates during much of the year  which caused lower margins during the first half of o total noninterest income increased by million from to million 
financial services accounted for million of the improvement in noninterest income  with approximately  being attributable to increased revenues from bpa the company s pension administration and consulting business and nearly  attributable to the full year impact of the purchase of elias asset management eam on april  revenues excluding net investment gains losses and the impact of branch properties no longer in use were up nicely for the seventh consecutive year to approximately million in  a million improvement 
o noninterest expense or overhead rose million or in to million 
acquisition and other one time expenses and intangible amortization accounted for of the increase  or and million  respectively 
while day to day overhead expense rose due to the company s three acquisitions  more than million in expense reductions was realized on an annualized basis beginning in the third quarter of the year as a result of aggressive cost cutting and efficiency improvement strategies 
o loan loss provision expense fell  or from s level 
the full year loan loss provision covered total actual net charge offs by times 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans remained flat in at 
the lower level of provision was in part due to the level being elevated by two isolated and unusual commercial loan charge offs 
nonperforming loans increased during to 
of loans outstanding at year end compared to 
one year earlier  reflective of the weak economy 
o the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased one percentage point this year to as a result of an increased proportion of tax exempt municipal investment holdings and continued effective tax planning strategies 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows at december percentage of net income to average total assets percentage of net income operating to average total assets percentage of net income to average shareholders equity percentage of net income operating to average shareholders equity percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income per share percentage of dividends declared per common share to net income operating per share percentage of average shareholders equity to average total assets net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors  interest on capital market borrowings  and dividends paid on the company s trust preferred stock 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
net interest income with non taxable income converted to a full tax equivalent basis totaled million in  this represents a million or increase over the prior year 
the increase was due to higher earning asset volumes  which had a positive impact on net interest income of million  while interest rate changes had an offsetting impact of million 
gross interest income on loans and investments grew by million or in as a result of greater average earning assets of million  which contributed million  partially offset by million related to lower rates 
average loans grew a total of million in  with the most significant portions occurring as a result of the january acquisition of million in loans from citizens national bank of malone and the november acquisition of million associated with the fleetboston branches 
overall interest and fees on loans climbed million or as a result of this growth  partially offset by a basis point bp decrease in loan yields to  which was caused by falling capital market rates 
despite a falling rate environment  the steepening yield curve allowed for widening spreads over cost of funds on investment transactions 
this situation created favorable opportunities to expand the company s investment portfolio  which increased million on average excluding federal funds sold during the year 
two primary components of this expansion were a million securities strategy made possible by first liberty s ample capital position and additional purchases of million from the excess cash provided by fleetboston branch acquisition 
investment interest income in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the higher outstandings  partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from to 
the large volume of growth in being put on at declining market rates was the primary cause of the change in average investment yield 
the average earning asset yield fell basis points to in because of the aforementioned decrease in investment and loan yields and a reduced mix of loans to earning assets  which decreased on average from in to in this decline in loan mix is a consequence of favorable investment opportunities outlined above as well as a slight reduction in loans outstanding excluding the citizens and fleetboston branch acquisitions 
total average fundings deposits and borrowings grew by million in  largely attributable to a million increase in deposits related primarily to acquisitions and million more in capital market borrowings 
in addition to capital market borrowing largely from the federal home loan bank of new york  the bank has approximately million in trust preferred borrowings outstanding  million of which are floating rate offerings completed in july to help finance the fleetboston branch purchase 
total interest expense increased by million in higher average interest bearing funds contributed million in additional interest expense  with lower market rates offsetting this by million 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets  fell by basis points bps to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell bps to due largely to steady declines in deposit rates throughout the borrowing rate on capital market borrowings declined bps because of lower market rates and a higher mix of short term funding taken on in advance of the fleetboston branch acquisition 
cbsi s net interest margin decreased by basis points from in to this year as the bp decrease in the rate on average interest bearing deposits from to  in addition to the bp decrease in the average borrowed funds rate  were not enough to offset the bp drop in the earning asset yield 
by the third quarter of the year  however  margins turned up after steadily falling since third quarter  as downward repricing of the company s certificates of deposits continued while the decrease in earning asset yield moderated 
the company s net interest margin ranked in the favorable rd peer bank percentile through september  the following table sets forth certain information concerning average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the yields and rates thereon for the twelve month periods ended december   and interest income and resultant yield information in the tables are on a fully tax equivalent basis using a marginal federal income tax rate of

noninterest income the company s sources of noninterest income are of three primary types general banking services related to loans  deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network  financial services  comprised of personal trust  employee benefit trust  investment  and insurance products  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments or other occasional events 
total noninterest income in increased by to million  largely due to gains on the sale of investments  increased revenues from the company s benefits plans administrative services subsidiary bpa  and increased overdraft fees 
combined revenues  excluding transactions related to investment securities and disposal of branch properties  were up strongly for the seventh consecutive year to approximately million in  a million or improvement over noninterest income  excluding transactions related to investment securities and disposal of branch properties  as a percent of operating income was in  an increase of one percentage point from the prior year 
the largest segment of the company s recurring noninterest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
this segment contributed of noninterest income  excluding net investment securities gains losses and disposal of branch properties 
highlighting this increase was a large rise in service charges on deposit accounts and overdraft fees  which increased by million  a growth rate over million in this reflects the company s acquisitions  including a fee schedule increase in the first liberty market 
offsetting this increase was a decline of  in revenue from electronic banking products due to a change in the company s visatm affiliation 
mortgage banking fees were up strongly at  in  an increase from  in the prior year 
the primary reason for the increase was the sharp rise in loans sold on the secondary market to million from million in  as driven by a decline in capital market rates 
this change is reflected in an increase in mortgage servicing rights from  in to  this year 
loan servicing fees a component of mortgage banking income were  in  up from the previous year on a serviced loan portfolio of approximately million  consisting of  loans 
fees from the financial services segment of noninterest income rose million or in to million 
as a whole  financial services now comprise of total noninterest income  excluding net investment securities gains losses 
strength in revenue from record keeping and consulting services provided by ebt bpa our pension administration business working in concert with the bank s employee benefit trust service  offset a reduction in personal trust revenues  that was caused by lower estate fees which periodically fluctuate and transfer of mutual fund sales commissions now being earned through the company s broker dealer  community investment services  inc cisi 
growth in cisi revenues was consistent with an expanded force of financial consultants  which numbered at year end  including four in the recently acquired and formerly underserved first liberty franchise 
the rise in revenues at investment manager elias asset management reflects the full year impact of the firm  which was acquired in second quarter lastly  commissions from insurance products increased slightly due to greater sales by financial consultants and a higher dividend from the underwriter of cbsi s creditor life insurance products 
assets under management from the company s several financial services businesses dipped slightly to billion in compared to billion in the prior year  largely reflective of reduced equity market levels 
overall  financial services contributed million or of the company s pretax net income this year before allocation of indirect corporate expense  reflecting nearly a return on revenue 
in  the net income contribution was million or  with a return on revenue of almost 
the decrease in earnings and return on revenue was caused by front end recruiting payments to new financial consultants and reduced fees on products tied to equity assets under management 
lastly  income from periodic transactions in largely includes million in gains taken on million in investment sales  with the net proceeds used to pre pay million in high cost fhlb borrowings at a million premium 
this amount compares to losses of  last year 
the investment gains and losses taken over the last two years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio to achieve a desirable total return and a targeted level of combined interest income and securities gains losses across financial market cycles 
the following table sets forth selected information by category of noninterest income for the company for the years and quarters indicated

for cbsi as a whole  higher personnel expense accounted for of s increase in overhead  with personnel costs up as a result of the three acquisitions 
the remainder of the increases in salary  benefit  and payroll tax expense reflect modest annual merit awards for employees 
total full time equivalent staff at year end was  versus at year end  up as the result of the acquisitions and their related impact on selected back office and administrative staffing 
nonpersonnel expense rose million or in excluding acquisition related expenses  nonpersonnel expense rose million or in this was largely caused by increases in intangible amortization  up million or  occupancy expense  up million or  equipment expense  up  or  and data processing  up  or 
the increase in intangible amortization was due to the citizens and fleetboston acquisitions and a full year of the elias asset management acquisition 
occupancy expenses increased largely due to the impact of the citizens branches acquired in january and the fleet branches acquired in november of higher equipment expenses were related to higher service contract costs and depreciation expense due to the additional number of branches in increases in data processing relates to higher fiserv processing fees  data line charges and check processing expenses 
the efficiency ratio is defined at two levels 
the nominal ratio is total overhead expense divided by operating income full tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net securities gains and losses 
the adjusted or recurring efficiency ratio additionally excludes one time expense and intangible amortization a non cash expense as well as all one time noninterest income  over the last five years  these one time income items have related to the disposal of branch properties 
the lower the ratio  the more efficient a bank is considered to be 
in  the recurring efficiency ratio increased percentage points to 
management believes it is more meaningful to use the recurring ratio to compare to national norms  because as mentioned above  most of the company s peers do not have intangible expense to the significance that cbsi has 
on that basis  cbsi s ratio is more favorable than the peer bank ratio of based on data available as of september  these results only partially reflect the full year impact of the million in annual cost savings implemented in mid second quarter in the first liberty market  including the associated benefit of streamlining our operations functions by eliminating duplicate loan and deposit processing units in canton and olean  ny 
however  because of the surge in volumes being processed as a result of the former fleetboston branches  fourth quarter part time and overtime costs were some  higher than in the same period a year earlier  representing a 
lag in lowering the efficiency ratio 
as experience in handling this additional work is gained  improvement in the efficiency ratio is expected 
by the nature of the company s financial services businesses  the efficiency ratio of those activities was in compared to in the prior year 
the efficiency ratio of the company s banking activities was this year compared to in as discussed above  the efficiency ratio is expected to improve for both businesses in acquisition and unusual expenses  which are excluded from the recurring efficiency ratio calculation  totaled million in the largest items comprising the expenditures include million in severance expense for first liberty  million in professional and consulting fees  million in postage  printing  and check replacement costs  million in data processing conversion costs and obsolete software write offs  and 
million in a wide variety of other nonrecurring expenses 
while the company s expense ratios have generally been favorable  management maintains a heightened focus on controlling costs and eliminating inefficiencies 
areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer comparisons  a bank wide program of employee involvement  targeted use of outside consultants  and review of productivity enhancing technology 
these combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from future price increases and higher transaction volumes and enable the company to more fully benefit from economies of scale as it continues to grow

income and income taxes income before taxes and extraordinary item in was million  down over the prior year s amount 
when income is recast as if all tax exempt revenues were fully taxable on a federal basis  s results fell by million or to million before tax 
the main reasons for the decline in pretax earnings were the million in acquisition and unusual expenses  partially offset by million in net investment security gains associated with the company s three acquisitions in january  may  and november 
favorable increases in net interest income  up million or full tax equivalent basis related to strong earning asset growth up or million on average  and a million or climb in noninterest income  excluding net securities gains losses  helped partially offset a portion of the acquisition related expenses 
the company s combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased one percentage point this year to 
the decrease resulted from effective tax planning  principally because of increased purchases of tax exempt municipal investments and other earning asset strategies during the year 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up from one year earlier 
this improvement reflects earnings for the year  the positive change in market value adjustment mva of the bank s available for sale investments  an additional  in common shares issued in conjunction with the company s january whole bank purchase of citizens national bank of malone  and million shares issued in the fourth quarter of to support the mid november purchase of branches from fleetboston financial  offset by dividends paid to shareholders 
excluding the mva in both and  capital rose by million or 
shares outstanding grew by million during the year due to the aforementioned issuance of stock and the exercise of stock options 
the company s ratio of tier i capital to assets or tier i leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum to be considered well capitalized  increased slightly from one year ago to 
this reflects the combined impact of the additional shares of common stock and approximately million in floating rate trust preferred stock raised to support the fleetboston branch acquisition  which more than offset greater intangibles resulting from acquisitions 
the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio increased bps during to as of year end compared to the minimum requirement for well capitalized banks 
the tangible equity tangible assets ratio ended the year at versus at december  the company is confident that capital levels are being prudently balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth largely reflects the aforementioned increase in the number of shares 
the quarterly dividend per share at 
remained unchanged from the level established in third quarter cbsi s dividend payout ratio for the year was compared to in  temporarily higher than the company s targeted payout range for dividends on common stock of 
its payout ratio has historically been strong relative to peers  and for  the ratio was in the th peer percentile 
the large increase in the payout ratio reflects maintenance of the dividend despite the decrease in net income from the prior year  which was largely due to one time acquisition expense 
loans the amounts of the bank s loans outstanding net of deferred loan fees or costs at the dates indicated are shown in the following table according to type of loan as of december  s omitted real estate mortgages residential      commercial loans secured by real estate      farm      total      commercial  financial  and agricultural agricultural      commercial and financial      total      installment loans to individuals      other loans      gross loans      less unearned discount     net loans      reserve for loan losses      loans  net of reserve for loan losses      loans outstanding  net of unearned discount  reached a record billion as of year end  up over million or compared to twelve months earlier 
about million or of s growth came from branches acquired in mid november from fleetboston financial  while million came from the company s whole bank purchase of citizens national bank of malone in january both loan figures reflecting slight run off since acquisition date 
excluding the acquisitions  total loans declined by million or 

cbna s new york franchise grew million or during the year to million 
in contrast  the pennsylvania franchise decreased by million or to million at year end 
none of these figures include million in mortgages originated within our local markets and sold in the secondary market to fnma 
had these loans not been sold  loan growth excluding acquisitions would have been million or 
the company s predominant focus on the retail borrower enables its loan portfolio to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding are oriented to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan basis 
over the last several years  the growth rate of cbsi s commercial business loans has exceeded that of loans to individuals  and even within this sector there is a high degree of diversification 
the bank s business loans are typically for amounts under  accounting for of our customers but only of our commercial loans outstanding 
about of our commercial portfolio is comprised of loans between  and million about of our customers  while loans over million comprise another of the portfolio of our customers 
the portfolio contains no credit card receivables 
the nature of lending table below recasts the company s loan portfolio into four major lines of business 
the increase in consumer direct loans contributed of the million in total loan growth in and business lending accounted for 
a smaller share of this year s total loan increase came from consumer mortgages while consumer indirect loans declined slightly 
the following more fully discusses the underlying reasons for changes in each of the company s four major lending activities or lines of business 
nature of lending mix at year end million and mix mix consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct total loans   the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
at million  this segment represents of loans outstanding at year end 
outstandings climbed over million or in and largely resulted from million in loans acquired from fleetboston financial  million in loans reduced by run off since acquisition date acquired from citizens national bank of malone  and million in growth from the new york market areas 
despite the softening economy  the bank was able to slightly grow business lending excluding acquired loans due to persistent business development efforts and the strength of its existing customer base 
turnover in staff in the first liberty market and run off of several large transactions due to refinancing with institutional lenders resulted in a million decrease in pennsylvania based loans 
cbna s total commercial portfolio is broadly diversified by industry type with the largest shares being in commercial real estate  services  and health care  followed by auto dealers and agriculture each  hotel eating drinking  manufacturing  and retail trade each  and construction and transportation each 
miscellaneous industries make up the balance at 
demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile  marine  and mobile home dealers fell modestly in outstandings ended the year or million lower  primarily resulting from reduced demand in certain of our market places and less new car financing due to significant discounting offered by the major manufacturers 
this portfolio segment  of which relates to automobile lending of the vehicles are used versus new  constitutes of total loans outstanding 
indirect loans in the company s first liberty franchise increased million up  in contrast to a million decrease down in the new york markets excluding acquisitions 
about million in indirect loans was obtained via acquisition in the segment of the company s loan portfolio committed to consumer mortgages is predominantly fixed versus adjustable rate residential lending 
it accounts for million or of total loans outstanding 
growth during the year of million or in resulted from million in loans including subsequent growth acquired from citizens national bank of malone and nearly million generated in the new york franchise  less million in run off in pennsylvania 
growth in the core mortgage portfolio prior to acquisitions is lower than it could have been had it not been for a program that began in mid to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
the purpose of this program  with sales of million in and million in  is to develop a meaningful source of mortgage banking income which reached  in as well as to provide an additional tool to manage interest rate risk 
the direct consumer lending activity increased or million in to million 
acquired loans in this segment included million from citizens national bank of malone and million from fleet boston nearly all of which were home equity financing 
the weak economy enabled a relatively small million increase in the core new york markets  while the first liberty market was more adversely affected down million  which management considers a consequence of the pennsylvania bank going through its change of ownership during this line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans including some isolated installment lending to small businesses  personal loans  student loans which are sold once principle repayment begins  and borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit 
the consumer direct segment as a percent of total loans was  compared to in the following table reconciles the differences between the line of business loan breakdown reflected above as compared to regulatory reporting definitions reflected on the call report and the table at the beginning of this section

ratio of nonperforming assets to period end total loans and other real estate the impact of interest not recognized on nonaccrual loans  and interest income that would have been recorded if the restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  was immaterial

provision and reserve for loan losses nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million 
this level is approximately million or higher than one year earlier  primarily due to increases in commercial and residential mortgage loan nonaccruals

of this latter increment to the reserve   related to citizens was offset by an increase to goodwill while the million related to fleetboston was offset by an increase to other intangibles 
as a percent of total loans  the loss reserve ratio increased to for year end versus last year 
as of september   the reserve ratio at was at the peer median and coverage of nonperforming loans at was above the norm in the nd percentile 
management believes the year end coverage at to be adequate in light of the probable losses in the company s loan portfolio

there are three primary sources of funding that comprise cbsi s overall funding matrix  which considers maturity  stability  and price deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits  and capital market borrowings 
sources of funds average th quarter balances million and mix mix ipc deposits   public funds capital borrowings total funds sources   the company s funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time record for a fourth quarter average of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
this is largely due to the million in deposits acquired from citizens national bank of malone in january and the million in deposits acquired from the former fleetboston branches in november ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and because they represent a working customer base with the potential to be cross sold a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products

consolidated mix non interest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings money market time deposits   total deposits    despite the acquisitions  the mix of cbsi s deposits changed only modestly 
the time deposit mix dropped from at the end of to at the end of  in part due to a lower relative mix in both the citizens and fleetboston acquisitions and due to a certain amount of movement out of time deposits by core customers who no longer wanted a maturity based product 
the money market mix increased from to due to the higher mix of money market accounts in the fleetboston branches and due to time deposit runoff flowing into this category 
no other deposit category mix changed by more than two percentage points 
deposits of local municipalities decreased million or during the past year  with balances for fourth quarter averaging million versus million for the same quarter 
under new york state municipal law  the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to capital market borrowings 
as such  cbsi endeavors to price these deposits at or below alternative capital market borrowing rates 
consequently  levels of municipal deposits fluctuate depending on how competitive pricing compares to the aforementioned borrowing rates 
it should be noted that utilization of municipal deposits has generally been flat to down over the last five years as a percent of total funding sources 
capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york  federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the national repurchase agreement market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
also considered as borrowings are the million in fixed rate company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities trust preferred issued to support s acquisitions  approximately million in floating rate trust preferred raised to support the fleetboston branch acquisition  and advances under a million line of credit tied to the day libor rate with a large regional commercial bank 
capital market borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for fourth quarter  a decline from the fourth quarter level of million or of total funding due to short term borrowings being replaced with acquired deposits 
as of december   only or million of capital market borrowings excluding the aforementioned line of credit and trust preferred securities had remaining terms of one year or less 
during third quarter  approximately million in investments was sold  resulting in million in gains used to offset million in penalties on prepaying million in longer term advances from the federal home loan bank 
these borrowings were replaced by core deposits from the fleetboston acquisition 
the swap allowed the bank to reduce the overall cost of the million in funds from to

this must be accomplished within the constraints of a absorbing funds when loan demand is low or when acquisitions provide additional net funding sources  and infusing funds when loan demand is high  b implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  c providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  d considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and e generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
from december  to december   the book value of cbsi s investment portfolio increased million or to billion  reflective of the purchase strategies described below  partially offset by strategic investment sales 
early in  prior to the first liberty merger  the bank s balance sheet simulation work pointed to an exposure to rising rates 
the inverted treasury yield curve was largely responsible for this profile 
to minimize this exposure  premium collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and premium mortgage backed pass throughs mbss were purchased to improve the company s interest income as rates rise 
following the first liberty merger in may and the fleetboston branch acquisition in november  the asset liability profile of the bank changed significantly due to the infusion of the long term core deposits 
the new liability structure shifted the bank s interest rate risk to one of greater exposure to falling interest rates 
to protect against such risk  the bank began to purchase intermediate municipal bonds and agency securities with a minimum of five years of call protection 
despite a falling rate environment  the steepening yield curve allowed for widening spreads over cost of funds on investment transactions 
this situation created favorable opportunities to expand the company s investment portfolio  which increased million on average excluding federal funds sold during the year 
two primary components of this expansion were a million securities strategy made possible by first liberty s ample capital position and additional purchases of million from the excess cash provided by fleetboston branch acquisition 
during  approximately million of investments was sold  resulting in net investment gains of approximately million 
about million of the sales resulting in a slight net loss was related to repositioning of acquired investments from citizens national bank of malone and first liberty bank corp 
the remaining million in sales  which resulted in a million gain  was used to offset penalties to prepay million in federal home loan bank longer term advances  which were replaced by core deposits from the fleetboston branch acquisition 
the swap allowed the bank to reduce the overall cost of the million in funds from to 
investment interest income in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the higher outstandings  partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from to 
the large volume of growth in being put on at declining market rates was the primary cause of the change in average investment yield 
through september   the tax equivalent investment yield was in the st peer percentile 
the composition of the portfolio continues to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and aaa rated insured municipal bonds 
as of year end  these four security types excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock accounted for over of total portfolio investments   and respectively 
excluding the first liberty investment portfolio much of which was sold to reposition the combined balance sheet  these four security types comprised of total investments as of december  at   and  respectively 
at year end  the average life of the portfolio was years with callable agency and municipal securities considered to maturity and the effective duration  which measures price sensitivity  was years 
since  the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for managing investment portfolio assets 
under this analytical method  shareholder value is maximized through both interest income and market value appreciation 
for the third quarter of prior to the fleetboston branch acquisition  the bank s five year total return at was in the excellent th peer percentile per the investment performance digest 
because nearly all of the bank s investments are classified as available for sale  any broad change in market value has a significant impact on book equity 
as of year end  the pre tax net market value gain over book value was million dollar price versus a gain of million as of year end this positive change of million added million to book equity  or per share outstanding as of december  the following table sets forth the amortized cost and market value for the company s investment securities portfolio at december  s omitted amortized amortized amortized cost book market cost book market cost book market value value value value value value held to maturity portfolio obligations of states and political subdivisions       total       available for sale portfolio us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies       obligations of states and political subdivisions       corporate securities       collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s       mortgage backed securities       total       equity securities       federal reserve bank common stock       total       net unrealized gain loss on available for sale    grand total carrying value    includes   and  of fhlb common stock at december   and  respectively

market risk interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk  over both a short term tactical and longer term strategic time horizon  is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors and reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits  and overall market interest rate level and trends 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tool used by the company in managing interest rate risk is income simulation 
the analysis begins by measuring the impact of differences in maturity and repricing all balance sheet positions 
such work is further augmented by adjusting for prepayment and embedded option risk found naturally in certain asset and liability classes 
finally  balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the company 
changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance sheet to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities 
the following reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity based on asset and liability levels on december   assuming no growth in the balance sheet  and assuming an instantaneous basis point increase and basis point decrease in the prime rate  federal funds rate and the entire treasury yield curve 
regulatory model rate change net interest income net interest income in basis points dollar change during first months percent change from flat rates bp million bp million the rising rate environment performs better than the falling rate environment due in large part to the increased level of core deposits  which are not as volatile in terms of rate movement as are other funding sources 
given the steepness in slope of the treasury yield curve as of year end  a second group of simulations was performed based on what the company believes to be conservative levels of balance sheet growth high single digit growth in loans and investments  and low single digit growth in deposits  augmented by any necessary increases in borrowings  with no growth in other major portions of the balance sheet 
on that basis  a variety of scenarios was tested  including a raising short term rates fed funds and prime by bp over a one year period while holding the long end of the treasury yield curve constant  and b holding short term rates fed funds and prime constant  while flattening the long end of the treasury curve 
under these sets of assumptions  the bank s net interest income shows a mild level of sensitivity to the flattening of the yield curve 
management model rate change net interest income net interest income in basis points dollar change during first months percent change from flat rates a increasing short term rates million b reducing longer term rates  
the preceding interest rate risk analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans  active management of the company s liquidity is critical 
in order to respond to these circumstances  adequate sources of both on and off balance sheet funding are in place 
cbsi s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
the minimum policy level of liquidity under the basic surplus deficit approach is of total assets for both the and day time horizons 
as of year end  this ratio was and  respectively  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank
