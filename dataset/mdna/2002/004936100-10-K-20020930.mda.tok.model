the company s financial position and operating results may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the timing of receipt  installation and regulatory approval of any one order  availability of additional capital  competition and technological change 
historically  three or fewer customers have accounted for more than percent of annual revenues 
see business customers and factors that may affect our future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to them in this md a 
critical accounting policies for the company include revenue recognition  accounting for research and development costs  and accounting for legal contingencies 
revenue recognition revenue for hardware sales is recognized when hardware components and the primary application software have been installed and are available for the customers use 
the company accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is required to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the company s sales of software products generally include multiple elements such as installation of software  training  post contract customer support and maintenance services 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and the specific terms of the agreement with the customer  could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
software license revenue is recognized upon acceptance of the software and the criteria for customer acceptance are generally defined by agreement 
the only undelivered element at the time of revenue recognition for software is generally support and maintenance services 
the company uses renewal rates to establish vsoe for support and maintenance services 
revenue allocated to support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
the company has entered into certain manufacturing royalty agreements where revenue is recognized as the licensed manufacturer sells the related hardware products 
for certain contracts requiring significant product customization  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
labor costs incurred for customization and installation are the basis for determining percentage of completion  giving effect to the most recent estimates of such total labor costs 
the effect of changes to total estimated customization and installation labor costs is recognized in the period in which such changes are determined 
the company defers revenue subject to penalty  forfeiture  refund or other concession until such factors have expired and the revenue meets the criteria for collectibility 
provisions for estimated losses are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 

table of contents research and development costs the company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or other wise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
the company has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to customers 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  the company expenses all research and development costs when incurred 
legal contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
the company evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flow

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not invest in market risk sensitive instruments  except that it did enter into forward currency exchange contracts during fiscal to manage a well defined foreign currency risk related to a sale in australia denominated in australian dollars 
the counterparty to the foreign exchange contracts was a large bank  resulting in minimal risk of credit loss due to non performance by the bank 
the purpose of these forward exchange contracts was to secure for the company the us dollar value of the sale that was denominated in australian dollars 
foreign exchange contracts have gains and losses that are recognized at the settlement date 
the impact of changes in exchange rates on the forward contracts are substantially offset by the impact of such changes on the value of the related sales contracts and accounts receivable 
the company s results of operations were not affected by the foreign exchange contract 
the company had not entered into any foreign exchange contracts during the fiscal years and  and has no current plans to enter into any such contracts

factors that may affect our future operating results you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report 
they are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
changes in business and economic conditions generally and in the gaming industry  economic impact of terrorist attacks the strength and profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for its products and growth in the gaming industry 
gaming industry revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions and generally rise or fall rapidly in relation to the condition of the overall economy 
in a period of reduced demand  such as resulted from the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   the company may not be able to lower its costs rapidly enough to counter a decrease in revenues 
all of the company s customers are in the gaming industry and a significant portion of those customers rely on tourism involving air travel for a large portion of their business 
the company expects that any significant sustained reduction in air travel and tourism will negatively affect the business of many of the company s casino customers 
this in turn may lead to a decrease in sales of the company s products to its casino customers and a corresponding decrease in the company s revenues 
liquidity historically  the company s operations have used cash 
although management believes that sufficient revenues will be generated during fiscal to meet operating  product development and other cash flow requirements  such revenues will depend on the completion of existing orders and the receipt of future orders 
on december   the company sold million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures and warrants in a private placement 
interest on the debentures at the rate of is due semi annually starting in april principal payments of  are due monthly from june to august and principal payments of  are due monthly from september until the principal is repaid

reliance on a few major customers the company is dependent on sales of its products to a limited number of casino operators for a substantial portion of its revenues in any given fiscal year 
historically  three or fewer customers have accounted for more than of annual revenues 
the following factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers  or a decision by one or more significant customers to select products provided by a competitor 
the company expects its operating results to continue to depend on sales of its products to a relatively small number of customers 
other risks litigation 
the company is engaged in a variety of litigation as more fully discussed in item legal proceedings 
this litigation is expensive and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these suits could have a material adverse effect on the company 
product concentration  competition  risks of technological change 
the company expects to derive most of its revenues from the sale of acres bonusing and the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to continue to generate sales of these products 
a decline in demand or prices for the company s products  whether as a result of new product introduction or price competition from competitors  technological change  or failure of the company s products to address customer requirements or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive and subject to technological change and one or more of the company s competitors may develop alternative technologies for its products 
the company s future results of operations will depend in part upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
while the company expends a significant portion of its revenues on research and development and on product enhancement  the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  or technological developments may cause the company s products to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than the company and the company may not be able to compete successfully with them 
government regulation  potential restrictions on sales 
the company is subject to gaming regulations in each jurisdiction in which its products are sold or are used by persons licensed to conduct gaming activities 
the company s products generally are regulated as associated equipment  pursuant to which gaming regulators have discretion to subject the company  its officers  directors  key employees  other affiliates and certain shareholders to licensing  approval and suitability requirements 
in the event that gaming authorities determine that any person is unsuitable to act in such capacity  the company would be required to terminate its relationship with such person  and under certain circumstances  the company has the right to redeem its securities from persons who are found unsuitable 
products offered and expected to be offered by the company include features that are not available on products currently in use 
these new features may  in some cases  result in additional regulatory review and licensing requirements for the products or the company 
compliance with such regulatory requirements may be time consuming and expensive  and may delay or prevent a sale in one or more jurisdictions 
in addition  associated equipment generally must be approved by the regulatory authorities for use by each licensed location within the jurisdiction  regardless of whether the company is subject to licensing  approval or suitability requirements 
failure by the company to obtain  or the loss or suspension of  any necessary licenses  approvals or suitability findings  may prevent the company from selling or distributing its product in such jurisdiction 
such results may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company often enters into contracts that are contingent upon the company and or the customer obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to sell or use the company s products or to operate 
table of contents a casino 
failure to timely obtain such approvals may result in the termination of the contract and the return of amounts paid pursuant to such contract 
availability of hardware components 
certain of the company s hardware components have long lead times and may be difficult to obtain within a reasonable period of time 
additionally  components can be discontinued by the company s vendors requiring modifications to the company s hardware to utilize similar  but more readily available  components 
the inability to obtain components within a reasonable period of time could negatively affect the receipt or delivery of orders 
patents and trademarks 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical security measures to protect its products 
the company has received us and foreign patents on certain features of its bonusing product line  has applied for additional us and foreign patents and may in the future apply for other us patents and corresponding foreign patents 
the company may also file for patents on certain features of products that the company may develop in the future 
notwithstanding these safeguards  it is possible for competitors of the company to obtain its trade secrets and to imitate its products 
furthermore  others may independently develop products similar or superior to those developed or planned by the company 
while the company may obtain patents with respect to certain of its products  the company may not have sufficient resources to defend such patents  such patents may not afford all necessary protection and competitors may develop equivalent or superior products which may not infringe such patents 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are expected to fluctuate significantly in the future  due to a number of factors  including  among others  the size and timing of customer orders  deliveries of orders  the timing and market acceptance of new products introduced by the company  changes in the level of operating expenses  technological advances and new product introductions by the company s competitors  competitive conditions in the industry  regulatory approval and general economic conditions 
product development and marketing costs are often incurred in periods before any revenues are recognized from the sales of products  and gross margins are lower and operating expenses are higher during periods in which such product development expenses are incurred and marketing efforts are commenced 
the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations may be materially affected by the receipt or loss of any one order and by the timing of the delivery  installation and regulatory approval of any one order 
the company may not be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations on a consistent basis 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
management of growth  liquidity 
to compete effectively and to manage future growth  the company must continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and expand  train and manage its employees 
any failure by the company to implement and improve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
purchase commitment contingencies 
pursuant to the company s arrangements with contract manufacturers  the company may have to pay for materials it directed such manufacturers to purchase on the company s behalf if the company fails to take delivery of such materials within a reasonable period of time  generally no longer than a few months 
if the company were obligated to pay for a significant amount of materials that were not included in finished products  its operating results and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to the extent that the company sells products under contracts denominated in other than us dollars  the company is subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
the company can manage these risks by entering into hedging arrangements in the foreign exchange market 
these hedging arrangements may be imperfect and may increase the company s cost of doing business
