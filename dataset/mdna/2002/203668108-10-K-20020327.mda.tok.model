item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are the largest non urban provider of general hospital healthcare services in the united states in terms of number of facilities and the second largest in terms of revenues 
as of december   we owned  leased or operated hospitals  geographically diversified across states  with an aggregate of  licensed beds 
in over of our markets  we are the sole provider of general hospital healthcare services 
in all but one of our other markets  we are one of two providers of general hospital healthcare services 
for the fiscal year ended december   we generated billion in net operating revenues and million in ebitda 
we achieved revenue growth of in and in we also achieved growth in ebitda of in and in acquisitions during  we acquired  through five purchase transactions  most of the assets  including working capital  of five hospitals 
the consideration for the five hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash  which we borrowed under our acquisition loan facilities  and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
since december   we have acquired  through two purchase transactions  most of the assets  including working capital  of two hospitals 
the consideration for the two hospitals totaled approximately million 
the operations of one of these hospitals was acquired from a local non profit organization  and the hospital itself is leased from a governmental entity 
we prepaid the lease obligation related to the lease transaction and have included the prepayment as part of the total consideration 
during  we acquired  through five purchases and two capital lease transactions  most of the assets  including working capital  of seven hospitals 
these acquisitions include the purchase of assets of a hospital which we were managing under an operating agreement 
we had purchased the working capital accounts of that hospital in the consideration for the seven hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash  which we borrowed under our acquisition loan facilities  and assumed liabilities of million 
we prepaid the lease obligation relating to each lease transaction 
we included the prepayment as part of the cash consideration 
during  we acquired  through three purchases and one capital lease transaction  most of the assets  including working capital  of four hospitals 
the consideration for the four hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash  which we borrowed under our acquisition loan facility  and assumed liabilities of million 
we prepaid the entire lease obligation relating to the lease transaction 
we included the prepayment as part of the cash consideration 
we also opened one additional hospital  after completion of construction  at a cost of million 
this owned hospital replaced a hospital that we managed 
goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  from the acquisition of our predecessor company in was million and from subsequent hospital acquisitions was million as of december  based on management s assessment of the goodwill s estimated useful life  we generally amortized our goodwill over years for acquisitions consummated prior to june beginning in july  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
which established new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill associated with acquisitions consummated after june   is not amortized 
we implemented the remaining provisions of sfas no 
on january  since adoption  existing goodwill is no longer amortized but instead will be assessed for impairment at least annually 
impairments to the carrying amount of such goodwill would result in a non cash charge which would reduce operating income 
the resulting reduction in goodwill amortization expense is approximately per share  after tax  for no impairment write down is expected from the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill represented of our shareholders equity as of december   the amount of goodwill amortized equaled of our income from operations for the year ended december  in the future  we intend to acquire  on a selective basis  two to four hospitals in our target markets annually 
because of the financial impact of acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the periods presented 
because ebitda margins at hospitals we acquire are  at the time of acquisition  lower than those of our existing hospitals  acquisitions can negatively affect our ebitda margins on a consolidated basis 
on may   we terminated the lease of a hospital previously held for disposition 
at december   the carrying amounts of one of our hospitals  held for disposition  was segregated from our remaining assets and classified in other assets  net in our consolidated balance sheet 
in  management decided not to dispose of this hospital and has therefore classified its assets in their respective categories 
sources of revenue net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
approximately of net operating revenues for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december   are related to services rendered to patients covered by the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings in the periods that such adjustments become known 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in future periods as final settlements are determined 
adjustments related to final settlements or appeals that increased revenue were insignificant in each of the years ended december   and we expect the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program to increase due to the general aging of the population and the restoration of some payments under the balanced budget refinement act of and benefit and improvement protection act of the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
reductions in the rate of increase in medicare reimbursement may have an adverse impact on our net operating revenue growth 
the implementation of medicare s new prospective payment system for outpatient hospital care  effective august   had a favorable but not material impact to our overall operating results 
in december  the benefit improvement and protection act of became law 
it is estimated that the changes to be implemented to many facets of the medicare reimbursement system will increase reimbursement 
we do not believe these increases will be material to our overall operating results 
in addition  certain managed care programs  insurance companies  and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals 
the trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely affect our net operating revenue growth 
results of operations our hospitals offer a variety of services involving a broad range of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services 
these include orthopedics  cardiology  ob gyn  occupational medicine  rehabilitation treatment  home health  and skilled nursing 
the strongest demand for hospital services generally occurs during january through april and the weakest demand for these services occurs during the summer months 
accordingly  eliminating the effect of new acquisitions  our net operating revenues and earnings are generally highest during the first quarter and lowest during the third quarter 
the following tables summarize  for the periods indicated  selected operating data 
years ended december  expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues net operating revenues operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization amortization of goodwill compliance settlement and year remediation costs income from operations interest  net income loss before taxes and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income loss before extraordinary item years ended december  percentage change from prior period net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions average length of stay ebitda same hospitals percentage change from prior period net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions ebitda operating expenses include salaries and benefits  provision for bad debts  supplies  rent  and other operating expenses  and exclude the items that are excluded for purposes of determining ebitda as discussed in footnote below 
ebitda consists of income loss before extraordinary items  interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and amortization of goodwill 
ebitda should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operations and provide useful information to investors 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
includes year remediation costs representing in adjusted admissions is a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
we computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
includes acquired hospitals to the extent we operated them during comparable periods in both years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  prior to being included in same store revenues  contributed million and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million 
the million  or  increase from hospitals owned throughout both periods was attributable primarily to inpatient and outpatient volume increases  rate increases and an increase in government reimbursement 
these increases were offset by having one fewer day as compared to  as was a leap year 
inpatient admissions increased by 
adjusted admissions increased by 
average length of stay remained unchanged 
on a same hospitals basis  inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by 
the increase in same hospitals inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions was due primarily to an increase in services offered  physician relationship development efforts  and the addition of physicians through our focused recruitment program 
on a same hospitals basis  net inpatient revenues increased by and net outpatient operating revenues increased 
both inpatient and outpatient growth reflects increased volume as well as rate increases 
outpatient growth reflects the continued trend toward a preference for outpatient procedures  where appropriate  by patients  physicians  and payors 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in  to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in primarily as a result of the acquisitions in having higher salaries and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues for which savings have not yet been realized  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues increased to in from in supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased to in from in primarily as a result of additional purchasing for recent acquisitions  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased from in to in as a result of increases in rent expense being offset by a reduction in other operating expenses 
these fluctuations have led to ebitda margins decreasing from in to in on a same hospitals basis  operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased from in to in and ebitda margin increased from in to in these efficiency and productivity gains resulted from the achievement of target staffing ratios  physician recruiting efforts  and improved compliance with national purchasing contracts 
operating expenses improved as a percentage of net operating revenues in the key categories of salaries and benefits and supplies 
depreciation and amortization increased by million from million in to million in the twelve hospitals acquired  including one constructed  in and accounted for million of the increase  hospital renovations and purchases of equipment  information system upgrades  and the inclusion of a hospital previously held for divestiture accounted for million of the increase and other deferred items  primarily the amortization of physician recruitment costs  accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
amortization of goodwill increased by million from million in to million in this increase primarily related to the seven hospitals acquired in and one hospital acquired in prior to the adoption of sfas no 
interest  net decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense can be primarily attributed to both savings from a decrease in average interest rates of million and savings of million due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
the twelve hospitals acquired  including one constructed  in and accounted for an interest expense increase of approximately million 
reduction of debt from repayments during and a full year of savings from repayments in resulted in savings of million  including savings of approximately million  offset by interest of million from the repayment of debt and issuance of convertible debt from our concurrent convertible debt and equity offerings in savings from a reduction in interest rates were approximately million 
income before extraordinary item and income taxes for was million compared to million in this improvement is primarily the result of revenue growth from both acquisitions and same store hospitals  management s ability to control expenses and a decrease of interest expense 
in october  we received the net proceeds from our concurrent equity and convertible debt offerings and used these proceeds to repay a portion of our long term debt 
in connection with the repayments  we recognized a million after tax extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the million of subordinated debentures 
the provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in due to the non deductible nature of certain goodwill amortization  the resulting effective tax rate is in excess of the statutory rate 
net income for was million as compared to million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to  million in from  million in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired  including one constructed  in and  contributed million and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million 
the million  or  increase in same hospitals net operating revenues was attributable primarily to inpatient and outpatient volume increases 
in  we experienced an estimated million of reductions from the balanced budget act of we have experienced lower payments from a number of payors  resulting primarily from reductions mandated by the balanced budget act of  particularly in the areas of reimbursement for medicare outpatient  capital  bad debts  home health  and skilled nursing  reductions in various states medicaid programs  and reductions in length of stay for patients not reimbursed on an admission basis 
we expect the balanced budget refinement act of and the benefit improvement and protection act of to lessen the impact of these reductions in future periods 
inpatient admissions increased by 
adjusted admissions increased by 
average length of stay decreased by 
on a same hospitals basis  inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by 
the increase in same hospitals inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions was due primarily to an increase in services offered  physician relationship development efforts  and the addition of physicians through our focused recruitment program 
on a same hospitals basis  net outpatient operating revenues increased 
outpatient growth reflects the continued trend toward a preference for outpatient procedures  where appropriate  by patients  physicians  and payors 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  remained unchanged at from to adjusted ebitda margin remained unchanged at from to salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased from in to in provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased to in from in due to an increase in self pay revenues and payor remittance slowdowns in part caused by an increase in the number of acquisition conversions 
the conversion is the process by which the company must apply for new medicare and medicaid provider numbers on acquired hospitals 
this process results in billing delays and payor remittance slowdowns and subsequently an increase in the allowance for uncollectible receivables during the conversion period 
supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased to in from in rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  remained unchanged at from to on a same hospitals basis  operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased from in to in and adjusted ebitda margin increased from in to in these efficiency and productivity gains resulted from the achievement of target staffing ratios  physician recruiting efforts  and improved compliance with national purchasing contracts 
operating expenses improved as a percentage of net operating revenues in every major category except provision for bad debts which increased slightly and other operating expenses which were flat compared to depreciation and amortization increased by million from million in to million in the twelve hospitals acquired in and accounted for million of the increase  facility renovations and purchases of equipment primarily accounted for million and other deferred items  primarily the amortization of physician recruitment costs  accounted for the remaining million 
amortization of goodwill increased by million from million in to million in this increase primarily related to the twelve hospitals acquired  including one constructed  in and interest  net increased by million from million in to million in the twelve hospitals acquired  including one constructed  in and accounted for approximately million of the increase  borrowings under our credit agreement to finance capital expenditures and physician recruiting accounted for million of the increase  borrowings to fund our compliance settlement accounted for million of the increase and changes in interest rates accounted for million of the increase 
these increases were offset by savings of approximately million from the repayment of long term debt with the proceeds from our initial public and secondary offerings in and a savings of million from an increase in cash flow from operations 
income before income taxes for was million compared to a loss of million in this improvement is primarily the result of revenue growth from both acquisitions and same store hospitals  management s ability to control expenses and a reduction in the growth rate of interest expense 
the provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in due to the non deductible nature of certain goodwill amortization  the resulting effective tax rate is in excess of the statutory rate 
net income for was million as compared to a million net loss in liquidity and capital resources compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from cash provided of million during to cash provided of million during due primarily to an increase in net income of million  an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization of million  use of deferred tax assets of million during  as compared to use of deferred tax assets of million in  the absence of the million compliance settlement payment made during and improvements made in the management of working capital 
the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during net cash provided by financing activities decreased million from million in to million in we raised million in proceeds  net of expenses from our concurrent convertible debt and equity offerings completed in  which were used to repay long term debt 
million was used to repay subordinated debentures held by the limited partners of an affiliate of forstmann little co 
our borrowings during were million and  excluding the offering proceeds  repayments of long term debt were million 
this represents a million decrease in borrowings as compared to million of borrowings in and an increase in repayments of million as compared to repayments of million in as described more fully in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had certain cash obligations  which are due as follows in thousands total and after long term debt      convertible notes   capital leases      total long term debt     operating leases      replacement facilities    total      also  as more fully described in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december   we had issued letters of credit primarily in support of certain outstanding bonds of approximately million 
in addition  at december   we had million in available borrowings from revolving lines of credit and million in available borrowings from an acquisition line of credit 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from a use of million during to cash provided of million during due primarily to an increase in net income of million  use of deferred tax assets of million during as compared to creating deferred tax assets of million in  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and the million compliance settlement payment made during the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in this increase is due primarily to an increase in cash used to finance hospital acquisitions of million during and an increase in cash used to finance all other capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million from million in to million in we raised million in proceeds  net of expenses from our initial public and secondary offerings completed in  which were used to repay our long term debt 
our borrowings during were million and  excluding the offering proceeds  repayments would have been million 
excluding the offering proceeds and the refinancing of our credit facility in  this represents a million increase compared to borrowings of million and repayments of million in the million increase in borrowings is related to the increase in the amount spent on acquisitions of facilities partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows 
capital expenditures cash expenditures for purchases of facilities were million in  million in and million in these expenditures include million for the five hospitals acquired  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals and million for the purchases of other clinics and working capital at a managed facility in  million for the seven hospitals acquired  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals and million for working capital at a managed facility in  and million for the four hospitals acquired and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals in excluding the cost to construct replacement hospitals  our capital expenditures for totaled million compared to million in and million in costs to construct replacement hospitals totaled million  including million of capital leases related to the construction projects in  million in and million in the reduction of capital lease liabilities is included in financing activities in our statement of cash flows 
pursuant to hospital purchase agreements in effect as of december   we are required to construct four replacement hospitals through with an aggregate estimated construction cost  including equipment  of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million has been expended through december  we expect total capital expenditures of approximately to million in  including approximately to million for renovation and equipment purchases which includes amounts pursuant to purchase agreements and approximately to million for construction of replacement hospitals 
capital resources net working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was attributable primarily to an increase in accounts receivable due to a combination of growth in same hospitals revenues during and the addition of five hospitals in  an increase in deferred income tax assets tax effected value of existing net operating loss carryforwards which will be available to offset current year taxable income and a reduction in accrued interest  resulting from lower interest rates and the repayment of million of our subordinated debentures  offset by an increase in the current maturities of long term debt  accounts payable and other liabilities 
in july  we amended our credit agreement 
our amended credit agreement provided for million as of july  and million as of december   in term debt with quarterly amortization and staggered maturities in    and this agreement also provides for revolving facility debt for working capital of million and for acquisitions of million at december  this new amendment extends the maturity of approximately of the revolver commitments to january  borrowings under the facility bear interest at either euro dollar rate or prime rate plus various applicable margins which are based upon a financial covenant ratio test 
as of december   using amended rates  our weighted average interest rate under our credit agreement was 
as of december   we had availability to borrow an additional million under the working capital revolving facility and an additional million under the acquisition loan revolving facility 
we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee at a rate which ranges from to based on specified financial performance criteria 
this fee applies to unused commitments under the revolving credit facility and the acquisition loan facility 
on november   we entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements  each for a notional amount of million  to limit the effect of changes in interest rates on a portion of our long term borrowings 
under the agreements  we pay interest quarterly at annualized fixed rates of  and  for terms ending november  and  respectively 
on the payment dates  we receive an offsetting variable rate of interest payments from the counterparty based on the three month london inter bank offer rate libor 
the terms of the credit agreement include various restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  dividends  sale and leasebacks  contingent obligations  transactions with affiliates  and fundamental changes 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding senior indebtedness  senior interest  and fixed charges 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and acquisition facility will be sufficient to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements through the next months 
if funds required for future acquisitions exceed existing sources of capital  we will need to increase our credit facilities or obtain additional capital by other means 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
third party reimbursement net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings in the periods that such adjustments become known 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in future periods as final settlements are determined 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that could become uncollectable in the future 
substantially all of our receivables are related to providing healthcare services to our hospitals patients 
our estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on our historical collection experience for each type of payor 
the allowance amount is computed by applying allowance percentages to amounts included in specific payor and aging categories of patient accounts receivable 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill arising from business combinations completed prior to july  is amortized on a straight line basis ranging from to years 
goodwill arising from business combinations completed after july  are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
and are not amortized 
annually  through december   as required by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 we reviewed our total enterprise goodwill for possible impairment  by comparing total projected undiscounted cash flows to the total carrying amount of goodwill 
professional liability insurance claims the company accrues for estimated losses resulting from professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
the accrual  which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  is based on historical loss patterns and actuarially determined projections 
to the extent that subsequent claims information varies from management s estimates  the liability is adjusted currently 
our insurance is underwritten on a claims made basis and substantially all of our professional and general liability risks are subject to a million per occurrence deductible 
recent accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and effective january   adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our financial guidance for excludes non cash amortization of goodwill but includes non cash amortization of other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
and no 
the resulting reduction in goodwill amortization expense is approximately per share after tax for no impairment write down is expected from the adoption of sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was issued in june by the financial accounting standards board and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is encouraged 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities and to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of this new standard 
on august   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement also amends arb no 
consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions are generally to be applied prospectively 
we are currently assessing the impact of this new standard 
federal income tax examinations we have settled the internal revenue service examinations of our filed federal tax returns for the tax periods ended december  through december   inclusive 
in that settlement  we have agreed to several adjustments  primarily involving temporary or timing differences  and paid approximately million in august  in satisfaction of the resulting federal income taxes and interest

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our credit agreement which bears interest based on floating rates 
in order to manage the volatility relating to the market risk  we entered into interest rate swap agreements described above 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in fiscal we utilize risk management procedures and controls in executing derivative financial instrument transactions 
we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations are used with the goal of mitigating a portion of the exposure when it is cost effective to do so 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for  million for  and million for
