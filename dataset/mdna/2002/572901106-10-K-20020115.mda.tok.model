we disclaim any duty to update the statements contained herein 
we have experienced net operating losses since our inception  are likely to continue to experience net operating losses in the short term  and may never become profitable 
we have experienced net operating losses since our inception 
as of october   we have an accumulated deficit of  until we realize significant revenues from sales of our nutritional products  we expect to continue to experience net operating losses 
our balance of cash and cash equivalents at october  was approximately million and as of october   we had approximately million in short term investments and marketable securities 
in december  we closed a private placement of our stock which gave us additional net proceeds of approximately million 
we have a current balance of cash and liquid investments of approximately million at december  although this cash should allow us to meet our operating needs for at least the next months  we must achieve sustained profitability to generate the cash necessary to be a viable business in the long term  and at this time we have not yet generated a sustained source of revenues to achieve this 
if our infant formula licensees delay the launching of products containing our nutritional oils in the united states  or infant formula products containing our nutritional oils do not gain widespread acceptance in the united states  or our infant formula licensees do not broaden their use of our nutritional oils in their products overseas  we may not be able to reach revenue levels that would allow us to be profitable 
nutritional product sales and royalties are likely to be our main source of revenues in the future 
although we sell some of our nutritional oils into the adult nutritional products market  over of our current nutritional product revenues come from our license agreements with infant formula manufacturers 
as such  we depend on the licensees sales of products that include our nutritional oils 
although some of our licensees have included our nutritional oils in some of their products outside the united states  and two of our licensees have announced plans to launch infant formula supplemented with our nutritional oils in the united states in early our licensees in the united states may delay launching or not follow through with their planned launches of products containing our oils  infant formula supplemented with our nutritional oils may not gain widespread acceptance in the united states  additional licensees may not introduce infant formula products containing our nutritional oils in the united states  or our licensees may not broaden their use of our nutritional oils overseas 
if these events occur and we do not recognize significant revenues as a result of increased product introductions  we do not expect to be profitable from the sale of nutritional oils to our licensees 
ultimately our success in the infant formula industry depends on growing acceptance of our nutritional oils as necessary or beneficial additives to infant formulas 
notwithstanding existing clinical results that have demonstrated the beneficial effects of adding our nutritional oils to infant formula  some experts in the field of infant nutrition do not believe that our nutritional oils are necessary or that they provide any long term beneficial effects 
there have also been clinical studies where no beneficial effects have been found  possibly due to dose  duration or other factors 
also  many experts recommend that mothers breastfeed rather than use infant formulas whether or not they contain our nutritional oils 
some experts also believe that infant formula without our oils contains sufficient precursor fats that infants can convert into dha and ara as needed 
in addition  some physicians are unimpressed by studies showing that infant formulas fortified with our oils improve infants cognitive ability at early ages  suggesting that these results may not carryover to improved results later in life 
due to these differences in opinion  we are subject to the risk that the use of dha and ara in infant formula may never gain widespread acceptance 
if our licensees do not satisfy relevant regulatory requirements for the use of our nutritional supplements in infant formulas  they will not be able to market formula containing our products 
many of our products and the manufacturing and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and similar regulatory authorities in other countries depending on the product type and method of manufacture 
for example  the fda regulates  to varying degrees and sometimes in very different ways  infant formulas  dietary supplements  foods  medical foods  animal feed and pharmaceutical products 
in may  the fda completed its review of our generally recognized as safe gras notification 
the agency issued a letter notifying us that the fda had no further questions regarding our conclusion that our dhasco and arasco oil blend is gras when used in specific ratios in infant formula 
our licensees are responsible for satisfying the required statutory and regulatory pre market notifications with the fda before launching a product that contains our oils in the united states 
on january   one of our licensees  mead johnson nutritionals  announced that it will be introducing a new infant formula supplemented with our oils in early february under the brand name enfamil lipil in the united states 
additionally  on january   another licensee  the ross products division of abbott laboratories  announced that it also plans to launch an infant formula supplemented with our oils in the united states in early the ultimate timing of launches of supplemented formula by our licensees  however  is not under our control  and there can be no assurance that these launches will not incur significant delays that may materially and adversely affect the timing of the introduction of infant formulas containing our products in the united states 
if additional positive clinical results are not obtained  we may not be able to develop a profitable market for our nutritional oils outside of the infant formula market 
approximately of our current nutritional product revenues come from sales of our nutritional oils to distributors and directly to consumers in the adult supplement market 
investigators at universities and at other research centers  such as the national institutes of health  have observed a relationship between low levels of dha and a variety of health risks  including increased cardiovascular problems  cystic fibrosis  cancer  and neurological and visual disorders 
we are currently trying to establish what contribution  if any  supplementation with our oils will make in addressing these problems 
although clinical data is not required to market nutritional supplements to consumers or distributors outside of the infant formula market  we believe that further clinical studies are needed to validate the benefits of dha supplementation 
accordingly  we have recently begun sponsoring studies to further investigate the potential benefit of dha supplementation on cardiovascular health and breast cancer  and we  as well as others  are conducting research regarding the impact of dha supplementation on cystic fibrosis and certain visual and neurological disorders 
unless these studies  which are more extensive than earlier pilot studies  establish and quantify the positive impact of dha supplementation  we may only have a limited adult nutritional supplement market opportunity 
even if our products do obtain widespread acceptance  we may not be able to price the products at a level that would allow us to be profitable 
infant formula pricing is very competitive and the market is very sensitive to product price changes 
because the inclusion of our oils into infant formula may add to to the retail cost of standard infant formula  there is the risk that our licensees may never be able to sell supplemented products at a price that will allow them to gain broad market acceptance while at the same time be profitable 
although our current contracts with licensees outline product pricing and royalty rates  we cannot predict whether these pricing structures will allow our licensees to be competitive in the future 
if we have to reduce our prices  we may not be able to sell products at a price that would enable us to be profitable 
since december  over of our sales to infant formula licensees have been made under all inclusive pricing  and we anticipate that this trend will continue for future sales to infant formula licensees 
we do not believe that this change is material to investors as the economics of all inclusive pricing is similar to the royalty bearing arrangements  with the current transfer price and royalty combined into one price with a slight discount 
although either our all inclusive pricing structure or the royalty bearing arrangements will enable us to achieve profitability if our products receive widespread acceptance  we cannot predict whether either of these pricing structures will enable our licensees to achieve success marketing these products 
none of our license agreements requires our licensees to purchase any minimum amount of products from us now or in the future and all of our license agreements allow our licensees to manufacture our products themselves or purchase nutritional oils from other sources 
if we are unable to increase our production capacity or enter into favorable agreements with third parties to produce our oils  our customers may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of dha and ara at a commercially reasonable price to gain a broad acceptance of these products and our future revenues from these products may be limited 
to meet our customers projected demand for our nutritional oils  we have developed a process for the large scale production of our oils at our winchester  kentucky manufacturing plant 
we estimate the worldwide infant formula market to be approximately to billion 
if our licensees were to penetrate of this market with dha and ara supplemented formulas  we estimate that we would receive approximately to million in revenues annually from these sales 
to date  our licensees have penetrated less than of the worldwide infant formula market 
while our current production level in our plant is sufficient to meet this current demand  if demand increases beyond our current production capabilities  we may be unable to produce the required quantities of oil cost effectively 
although our licensees have a right to manufacture dha and ara  we are not aware of any of our licensees doing so or preparing to do so 
we estimate that it may take a licensee approximately one year or more to develop their process of making our oils 
accordingly  if we are unable to meet demand  our licensees may not be able to manufacture product themselves for at least one year 
we believe that we can increase production to supply approximately to of the worldwide infant formula market with additional capital expenditures 
however  our ability to maintain commercial production at those levels at our plant has not been successfully tested 
in  we initiated plans to expand our existing facility in winchester  ky to accommodate increased production 
we believe that this buildout  which should more than double our production capacity at our plant  will cost as much as million 
in addition  to further increase our production capacity  in december we signed a non binding letter of intent to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of fermpro  a contract fermentation company 
fermpro s production facility consists of a acre site in kingstree  south carolina with fermentation  recovery  laboratory and warehousing components 
the facility will provide us with extensive production expansion capabilities for manufacturing our nutritional oils  as well as a highly trained workforce 
we have also conducted dha production trials with third party manufacturers 
however  we do not currently have a third party manufacturing agreement in place to supply us with dha containing oil 
if we are unable to cost effectively manufacture our dha containing oils at our plant  unable to complete the acquisition of fermpro  unable to enter into a favorable third party manufacturing agreement  or our licensees are unable to find alternative sources for our dha containing oils  our licensees may not be able to meet demand and our revenues may be limited in the future 
although we are able to produce ara containing oil at our winchester plant  we have entered into an agreement with a third party manufacturer  dsm  to supply our ara containing oil 
we believe that dsm can provide us with sufficient quantities of ara oil to supply approximately to of the worldwide infant formula market 
if dsm fails to supply us with required amounts under the contract  we would not be able to meet our customers demands 
in this case  we would have to either manufacture the ara containing oil at our plant  which would reduce our dha containing oil production capacity  or enter into other third party manufacturer supply agreements 
if we are unable to find alternative supply sources or are unable to cost effectively manufacture the ara containing oil in our winchester plant  our licensees may not be able to meet future product demand and our future revenues from sales of ara containing oils may be limited 
because we are still in the early stages of product development  we will need significant additional capital to expand our production capability  continue our research and development efforts  conduct product testing  including preclinical and clinical trials  and market our products 
we have a number of products that are in the early stages of research and development  product testing  manufacturing or marketing 
our nutritional oils sales are increasing  and meeting future demand will require expanding our production capability for dha oil 
we estimate that our initial expansion plan may cost up to million 
although at december  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents available to meet these capital requirements  we believe that additional funds of to million may be needed in the longer term to fund additional expansion of our production capacity either at our winchester  ky facility or at other third party manufacturing facilities  our research and development  product testing  and marketing activities 
the timing and extent of our additional cash needs will primarily depend on the timing and extent of future launches of infant formula products containing our oils by our licensees  and our ability to generate profits from the sales of these oils 
to continue to fund our growth  we will pursue various sources of funding  which may include equity issuances  debt financing  asset based borrowing  lease financing  and collaborative arrangements with partners 
because debt financing arrangements may require us to comply with financial covenants  we may not be able to secure debt financing on terms acceptable to us 
additionally  funding from other sources may not be available  or may not be available on terms that would be commercially acceptable or permit us to continue the planned commercialization of our products or expansion of our production capacity 
if we obtain funds through collaborative or strategic partners  these partners may require us to give them technology or product rights  including patents  that could ultimately diminish our value 
if we cannot secure adequate funding  we may need to scale back our research  development  manufacturing  and commercialization programs which may have a materially adverse affect on our future business 
the market price of our common stock may experience a high level of volatility due to factors such as its relative illiquidity  the volatility in the market for biotechnology stocks generally  and the effect of short term events like product launches and license announcements 
we are a public emerging growth company in the biosciences sector 
as frequently occurs among these companies  the market price for our common stock may experience a high level of volatility 
during the fifty two week period ending october   our common stock price has traded between and 
during the fifty two week period ending october   our common stock price ranged from to 
the following are examples of items that may significantly impact the market price for our common stock announcements of technical innovations  new commercial products  product launches  new license arrangements or strategic partnerships by us or our competitors  patent or other intellectual property disputes  quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  regulatory decisions approvals or disapprovals concerning our products and our competitors products  and general market conditions for emerging growth companies and bioscience companies 
because we may experience a high level of volatility in our common stock  you should not invest in our stock unless you are prepared to handle a significant loss of your capital 
at any given time  you may not be able to sell your shares at a price that you think is acceptable 
the market liquidity for our stock is very low 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
since our initial public offering of common stock on november   the average daily trading volume in our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market has been  shares 
the average trading volume in our common stock during the fifty two week period ending october  was  shares 
although a more active trading market may develop in the future  the limited market liquidity for our stock may affect your ability to sell and the price at which you are able to sell your shares of common stock 
if significant shares eligible for future sale are sold or registration rights are exercised  the result may depress our stock price by increasing the supply of our shares in the market at a time when demand may be limited 
because we continue to require additional outside sources of capital to finance  among other things  our research and development  product testing  and the manufacturing or marketing of our products  we may need to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  stock options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at various exercise prices ranging from to per share  and warrants outstanding to purchase up to  shares of common stock at exercise prices between and 
to the extent that these options and warrants for our common stock are exercised  the increase in the number of our outstanding shares of common stock may adversely affect the price for our common stock 
this could hurt our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
additionally  some of our stockholders who bought shares or warrants from us in private placements have registration rights 
if the stockholders were to exercise their registration rights when we are seeking to raise capital by selling stock in a registered offering  the result could effectively prevent us from doing so 
our current patents may not be able to provide protection against competitive products and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property portfolio in the future 
european and united states patent authorities have not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed for health and bioscience patents 
our issued patents  or patents that we may obtain in the future  may not afford adequate protection against competitors with competing technology because governmental agencies may revoke our patents for being too broad or may limit the scope of our patents 
if this happens  companies may be able to produce products using our previously patented technology 
omegatech  inc  monsanto corporation  aventis sa and nagase co 
ltd 
are challenging our european patent covering our dha containing oils 
at a hearing in october  a division of the european patent office revoked our patent on the grounds that it is too broad 
we immediately appealed this ruling  and as a result  our patent was reinstated so that it will remain in effect during the appeal process  which is not expected to be completed until sometime in  at the earliest 
if the revocation is upheld upon our appeal  or any other challenges to our patents are successful  our competitors may be able to produce our products and  as a result  we may experience decreases in the future sales of our nutritional oils  decreases in the revenues on sales of infant formula containing our oils and decreases in license fees related to our oils 
although our revenues may decrease under our license agreements  the revocation of our european dha patent would not terminate any of our license agreements 
with respect to our ara patent issued by the european patent office epo  basf ag  f 
hoffman laroche ag  friesland brands ag  omegatech inc  societe des produits nestle sa  and suntory limited have filed their grounds for opposing this patent with the opposition division of the epo 
the validity of the patent is unaffected by these filings 
the opposition process is not expected to be completed until sometime in  at the earliest 
omegatech has indicated to us orally that it may undertake an effort in australia to challenge the validity of our dha  ara and mixed oil patents 
we expect that in the future  as our nutritional oils continue to be commercialized  opposition to our intellectual property by our competitors will continue and most likely increase 
we are aware that our european dha and ara patents are being challenged and believe that challenges to our european patent covering our blend of dha and ara as well as our suite of us patents may arise in the future 
we may also incur substantial costs in the future defending our patents 
we are aware of several products that are currently available  and products under development  that may present a serious competitive threat to our products 
our success depends upon achieving and maintaining a superior competitive position in infant formula and adult nutritional product markets 
many of our competitors  which include basf  f 
hoffman laroche ltd  omegatech  inc  monsanto corporation  aventis sa and nagase co 
ltd  have substantially greater research and development capabilities  marketing  financial and managerial resources and experience in the industry 
if a competitor develops a better product or technology  our products or technologies may be rendered obsolete 
we believe that  to date  we have developed the most efficient production method and purest forms of dha and ara oils  however  we are aware that other methods of producing dha and ara are available 
although no company has yet received approval to market these products in infant formula in the united states  some infant formulas and other products now on the market outside the united states use oils derived from other sources  such as fish or eggs 
we are aware of the development of a dha containing fish oil which provides an alternative to our dha oil for infant formula applications 
although it is a lower cost product relative to our dha  fish oil has odor  stability and taste characteristics that may limit its usefulness 
only a very small percentage of currently marketed supplemented infant formulas contain dha and ara that have not been produced by us 
currently  fish oil based products dominate the adult dha supplement market 
we are aware of the development of microencapsulated fish oil products by several large companies  including basf and f 
hoffman laroche ltd 
although microencapsulation of the oil resolves much of the odor  stability and taste issues found with fish oil  a microencapsulated product is significantly more costly than regular fish oil 
because fish oil is significantly less costly than our dha oil  fish oil presents a substantial competitive threat to our neuromins dha 
none of these companies has yet received approval to include dha derived from fish oil or eggs in infant formula within the united states  however  some of these companies have received approval to include dha derived from fish oil in infant formula in asia and dha and ara derived from eggs in infant formula in europe 
we are also aware that omegatech  inc  an early stage company  is able to produce dha from a strain of fungus and is presently marketing this product in animal feeds as well as in adult nutritional supplements 
omegatech  inc is currently challenging our european dha and ara patents and  if their challenges are upheld on appeal  their ability to compete with us would be strengthened 
although  based on the strength of our intellectual property  we do not believe that omegatech s source of dha will present a significant threat in infant formula supplementation  we are currently unable to predict the future degree of competitive threat that omegatech s dha may present to us in the areas of adult nutrition 
general martek was founded in we are a leader in the development and commercialization of products derived from microalgae 
our leading products are nutritional oils used as ingredients in infant formula and foods  and as ingredients in  and encapsulated for use as  dietary supplements 
our nutritional oils are comprised of fatty acid components  primarily docosahexaenoic acid  commonly known as dha  and arachidonic acid  commonly known as ara 
many researchers believe that these fatty acids may enhance mental and visual development in infants  and play a pivotal role in brain function throughout life 
low levels of dha in adults have also been linked with a variety of health risks  including cardiovascular problems  cancer  and various neurological and visual disorders 
additional applications of our patented technology based upon microalgae include our algal genomics technology and our currently marketed fluorescent detection products and technologies that can be used by researchers as an aid in drug discovery and diagnostics 
in  we realized our first revenues from license fees related to our nutritional oils containing dha and ara and sales of sample quantities of these oils 
in  we recognized our first product and royalty revenues from sales of infant formula containing these oils  and in  we began to realize revenues from the sale of neuromins  a dha dietary supplement 
in  we first realized revenues from the sale of our new phycobilisome fluorescent detection products 
we currently have license agreements with seven infant formula manufacturers representing approximately of the estimated to billion worldwide market for infant formula 
five of these licensees are now marketing term infant formula products containing our oils in countries and pre term infant formula products containing our oils in over countries around the world 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception 
at october   our accumulated deficit was approximately  although we anticipate a continuation of our sales growth  we also expect our research and development  production optimization and product marketing activities to remain high  and as a result  expect our operating losses to continue for at least the first three quarters of in addition  we expect to continue to experience quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses  some of which may be significant 
the timing and extent of such fluctuations will depend  in part  on the timing and receipt of oils related revenues 
the extent and timing of future oils related revenues are largely dependent upon favorable fda and other regulatory actions related to products containing our oils  market introductions of products by our licensees  and or agreements with other future third party collaborators 
because of this  the timing or likelihood of future profitability is largely dependent on factors over which we have no control 
management outlook and regulatory issues we believe that while quarterly results may show fluctuations in product sales  the outlook for future revenue growth remains positive and that fiscal sales will surpass prior year levels 
specifically  we believe that for fiscal as a whole  term infant formulas containing our oils will be introduced in additional countries and sales and royalties from our nutritional oils will continue to grow 
to date  five of our infant formula licensees have obtained the regulatory approval  where required  to sell term infant formula products containing our oils in countries and pre term infant formula products containing our oils in over countries around the world 
no company has yet launched an infant formula containing our oils in the united states 
on may   we received notice from the fda that after completing its review of our generally recognized as safe gras notification  the agency had no further questions regarding our conclusion that our dhasco and arasco oil blend is gras when used in specified ratios in infant formulas 
our licensees are responsible for satisfying the required statutory and regulatory pre market notifications with the fda before launching a product that contains our oils in the united states 
on january   one of our licensees  mead johnson nutritionals  announced that it will be introducing a new infant formula supplemented with our oils in early february under the brand name enfamil lipil in the united states 
additionally  on january   another licensee  the ross products division of abbott laboratories  announced that it also plans to launch an infant formula supplemented with our oils in the united states in early the ultimate timing of launches of supplemented formula by our licensees is not under our control  however  and there can be no assurance that these launches will not incur significant delays that may materially and adversely affect the timing of the introduction of infant formulas containing our products in the united states 
nevertheless  we anticipate that new infant formula products containing our oils will continue to be introduced in various countries around the world and we will see continued growth in sales from infant formula related products  independent of us introductions 
results of operations revenues our revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and increased to  in  a increase over  mainly due to increased nutritional product sales and royalties 
our total product sales and royalties increased  or in over and increased  or in over our sales of nutritional products increased  or in over  and increased an additional  or in over our royalties on sales of infant formula products increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and increased to  in  a increase over the increase in our nutritional product sales and royalties is primarily due to increased sales of oil to infant formula licensees 
our licensees launched premium term infant formulas with our oils in twelve additional countries in  including the united kingdom and spain 
we are optimistic that as market acceptance of these products grows  more term infant formula launches will occur in additional countries around the world 
our sales of stable isotopes and other products decreased by  or in compared to  and decreased an additional  or in over for  decreased sales of stable isotopes were offset by improved sales of fluorescent marker products  which increased primarily due to a new distribution agreement with perkinelmer life sciences  inc which was entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year although we anticipate continued increases in fluorescent marker sales  our overall sales of stable isotopes and other products will decrease in the short term due to our sale of the stable isotope product line 
effective november   we sold the stable isotope product line to spectra gases  retaining a royalty interest in future isotope sales for five years up to a maximum of  and a ownership and royalty interest in a new company that was formed to market the technology surrounding the fast track protein labeling system 
our revenues from research and development work increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of compared to the decrease in is mainly due to a third party development project that occurred during at our winchester  ky plant that did not repeat in our revenues from license fees and other sources increased  in over  and further increased  in over  primarily due to the amortization of unearned revenue from our license agreement with abbott laboratories which was entered into in march  cost of product sales and royalties our cost of product sales and royalties increased to of product sales and royalties in  up from in  and decreased to in the improvement in margin in is primarily a result of the change in pricing to most of our infant formula licensees from a royalty based price to an all inclusive pricing structure 
under royalty based pricing we sell products to our licensees at an initial transfer price and there is an approximate three to six month delay after this sale until royalties are received and recognized as revenue 
under all inclusive pricing  we incorporate a slightly discounted royalty up front into our sales price 
the overall economics of an all inclusive price closely match those of our royalty bearing arrangements  however  the all inclusive price eliminates major fluctuations that result from the delayed impact of royalties 
since december  over of all sales to infant formula licensees have been made under all inclusive pricing  and management anticipates that this trend will continue for future sales to infant formula licensees 
our overall high cost of product sales and royalties includes costs associated with both ara and dha production 
our gross profit margins are most significantly impacted by the cost of ara oil  which is manufactured by a third party  dsm 
ara typically represents approximately two thirds of our product sales to infant formula licensees 
we believe that  with the complete amortization of the start up costs of dsm  currently included in the price of ara  and increased volume purchases  the cost of our ara oil will decrease significantly in  resulting in improved gross profit margins 
our high dha production costs reflect the fact that our current dha inventory was manufactured during a period when we had not yet realized dha production efficiencies at our winchester  ky plant due to the low volume of production and because we have not yet optimized our dha production process 
to prepare for increased production  in we began testing certain processing improvements at large scale  including expensive scale up experiments  which resulted in certain lost batches and reduced overall dha yields 
we continue to actively work toward improving our dha production yields  and believe that the additional costs incurred in will be more than offset by future benefits of improved yields and lower production costs 
in addition  our planned expansion in winchester  ky and proposed acquisition of the fermpro facility will bring economies of scale  which should also lower our future production costs 
research and development our research and development costs increased  or in over and increased an additional  or in over in  we incurred approximately million in research and development expenditures 
approximately of these costs related to nutritional oils development costs  approximately related to stable isotope research  and approximately related to research and development on our advanced detection technology 
with the sale of our stable isotope product line in november  we anticipate that over of our future research and development costs will be focused on our nutritional oils and less than focused on our advanced detection technology 
over two thirds of the research and development costs of our nutritional oils have been incurred at our winchester  ky plant 
we purchased this plant in  and since that time have continued an ongoing program to develop and refine processes for manufacturing our dha and ara oils at large scale 
we currently have numerous development projects underway at our plant aimed at increasing our production yields  reducing waste and improving the quality of our nutritional oils 
these projects are expected to last several years and may cost as much as million 
while we believe that these projects will continue to yield production improvements throughout the next several years and will result in reduced production costs and improved gross profit margins  the ultimate timing and impact of these projects on our operations and financial results cannot be accurately predicted 
in addition to the above  we incur approximately million annually on lab scale development work on our algal oils at our columbia research facility 
we currently have numerous projects ongoing at our columbia facility surrounding  among other issues  analytical analysis of our dha and ara  sensory issues and genomics work 
these projects are expected to continue for several years and may cost as much as million 
we also have numerous ongoing clinical trials involving our nutritional oils  some of which may take up to years to complete 
in  we spent in excess of million servicing these trials  and anticipate spending as much as million servicing these trials over the next several years 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative costs increased by  or in compared to  and increased an additional  or  in over these increases are primarily the result of increased general corporate insurance and legal expenses 
other operating expenses in  we incurred other operating expenses of  associated with evaluating and or obtaining additional capacity for the production of our dha and ara oils  including costs associated with testing and validating the fermentation technology at fermpro 
other income  net our other income  net increased by  in over  and increased an additional  in over  primarily due to higher cash balances on which interest income was earned and a decrease in interest expense on outstanding debt  which was extinguished during the second quarter of fiscal net loss as a result of the foregoing  our net loss increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of from recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

collaborative and licensing agreements we have entered into licensing agreements with seven infant formula manufacturers  including abbott laboratories  mead johnson company a subsidiary of bristol myers squibb company  american home products  numico  maarbarot and novartis  that together comprise over of the us and of the worldwide infant formula market 
we have contractually agreed not to disclose the name of our seventh licensee  a small infant formula manufacturer with less than of the worldwide market who has yet to purchase any products from us 
under all of these agreements  we received up front license fees  will receive a transfer price on sales of our oils to our licensees and will receive ongoing royalties based on our licensees sales of infant formula products containing our oils 
the agreements have terms exceeding years  contain no future funding commitments on the part of us or our licensees  and may be terminated by our licensees upon proper notification 
we recognized total product sales and royalties relating to our license agreements of approximately  in   in and  in pursuant to our most recent license agreement with abbott laboratories entered into on march   we received total consideration of million  which represents license fees and royalty prepayments 
we recorded these non refundable payments as unearned revenue and are recognizing them as revenue on a straight line basis over the twenty five year term of the agreement 
we will recognize the non refundable royalty prepayment  as well as potential ongoing royalties  as revenue as products are introduced by abbott in accordance with the terms of the agreement

nutritional oils production we currently manufacture our dha rich nutritional oils at our production facility in winchester  ky 
in response to the growing demand for our oils  we initiated plans in which should more than double the production capacity at our winchester facility 
we expect that this expansion  which includes three new large scale fermentors and a new facility to handle additional material handling and packaging requirements  will be completed in late we are also actively pursuing additional fementation at several other locations both within and outside the united states 
in relation to this search  we recently signed a letter of intent to acquire fermpro  a contract fermentation and processing facility located in south carolina 
this facility will provide us with extensive production expansion capabilities for manufacturing our nutritional oils as well as a highly trained workforce 
in january   we entered into an agreement with dsm under which they became our contract supplier for nutritional oils containing ara 
dsm is a multi billion dollar international group of companies that is active worldwide in the fields of life science  product performance materials and chemicals 
our agreement with dsm expires in and allows for martek or another third party to produce certain quantities of ara if customer demand requires it or if dsm does not meet competitive pricing guidelines 
at october  we had outstanding inventory purchase commitments to dsm totaling approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from proceeds from the sale of equity securities  product sales and receipt of license fees  cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  debt financing  and revenues received under research and development contracts and grants 
since our inception  we have raised approximately million from public and private sales of our equity securities  as well as option and warrant exercises 
we recently raised approximately million in december and approximately million in march from private placements of our common stock 
through october   we have incurred an accumulated deficit of  our balance of cash and cash equivalents at october  was  in addition  at october   we had  in short term investments and marketable securities  which consist primarily of us government securities with average maturities of less than one year 
with the private placement of our common stock in december  we have a current balance of cash and liquid investments of approximately million at december  our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities increased approximately million since october   primarily due to the funds received from the private placement of our common stock and warrants in march and december  offset by cash used to fund operations 
the planned expansion and continuing development and optimization of our production facility in winchester  ky will have a material effect upon our liquidity and capital resources 
during fiscal year we spent approximately million on capital equipment at our plant 
the initial buildout  which should more than double our production capacity at our winchester  ky plant  may cost up to million 
we believe that these expenditures can be funded with existing funds 
in the longer term  however  we may require additional funds in excess of million to further expand our production capacity at our winchester  ky plant  fund  or partially fund  expansion of third party manufacturing facilities  continue our research and development programs  conduct pre clinical and clinical studies  and commercialize our nutritional oils  neuromins dha  and our other products under development 
the ultimate amount of additional funding  if any  that we may require will depend  among other things  on one or more of the following factors the cost of capital expenditures at our manufacturing facilities  growth in our infant formula and nutritional product sales  the extent and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical studies  the time and costs of obtaining regulatory clearances for our products that are subject to such clearances  the costs involved in filing  protecting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of acquiring additional and or operating existing manufacturing facilities for our various products and potential products depending on which products we decide to manufacture and continue to manufacture ourselves  and the costs of marketing and commercializing our products 
if additional funds are needed in the future to continue to finance our operations and or additional capital needs  we would most likely raise these funds through the sale of equity securities  cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and or debt financing 
we can offer no assurance that  if needed  any of these financing alternatives will be available to us on terms that would be acceptable  if at all
