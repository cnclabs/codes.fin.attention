item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this item and elsewhere in this report contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described under important factors that may affect future operations and results below 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company principally focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic products 
two of our product candidates are in early stage clinical trials and we are preparing to begin clinical trials for one of these candidates in a second indication 
we use a proprietary  patented method  known as phage display  to identify a broad range of compounds with the potential for the treatment of various diseases 
we are using phage display technology to build a broad portfolio of product candidates that we plan to develop and commercialize either ourselves or with others 
on behalf of collaborators  we also use phage display technology to identify compounds that can be used in therapeutics  diagnostic imaging  the development of research reagents  and in purifying and manufacturing biopharmaceuticals and chemicals 
we are further leveraging our phage display technology through collaborations and licenses that are structured to generate revenues through research funding  license fees  technical and clinical milestone payments  and royalties 
we also develop  manufacture and sell chromatography separations systems and products through our biotage subsidiary 
we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of chromatography separations systems that use disposable cartridges to separate and purify pharmaceuticals being produced for research and clinical development 
results of operations year ended december  and total revenues for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
product revenues and product development and license revenues accounted for and respectively  of total revenues in  as compared with and in product revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in product revenues is due to increased unit sales in biotage s drug discovery purification systems and consumable business 
product development and license fee revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in product development and license fee revenues is primarily due to a full year of amortization associated with the upfront payments on several large funded collaborative arrangements  which were entered into during  as well as the continued expansion of our phage display licensing program  including the recognition of a perpetual patent license in as a result of amortization of upfront fees for collaborations signed in  our deferred revenues decreased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
these product development and license fees are amortized over the expected term of each agreement  ranging from one to six years 
cost of products sold in was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenues remained constant at 
research and development expenses for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from increased compound manufacturing and related expenditures for clinical trials  salaries and fringe expenses  and expenditures on new collaborative arrangements 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in non cash compensation because deferred compensation in included the acceleration of vesting of certain restricted stock related to the completion of our initial public offering 
as of december   we had two product candidates in phase ii clinical trials  dx for hereditary angiodema and dx for cystic fibrosis 
we expect both product candidates to complete phase ii trials during but the length of time needed to complete clinical trials can vary substantially 
an estimation of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly and are difficult to predict 
we expect that we will incur the most significant clinical development costs of these product candidates during phase iii trials 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  clinical trial and related costs  contract manufacturing and other outside costs  and overhead costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily due to increased salaries and fringe expenses in business development and corporate administrative functions  professional fees related to expanding and protecting our intellectual property and meeting the reporting requirements of a public company  and selling and marketing expenses at biotage as we continue to expand our sales capabilities including opening a japanese sales subsidiary 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in non cash compensation because deferred compensation in included the acceleration of vesting of certain restricted stock related to the completion of our initial public offering 
net other income increased to million in from million in  due to an increase in interest income earned from a higher average invested cash balance 
net loss in was million compared to million in year ended december  and total revenues for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
product revenues and product development and license revenues accounted for and respectively  of total revenues in  as compared with and in product revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in product revenues is primarily due to increased unit sales in biotage s drug discovery purification consumable business 
product development and license fee revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in product development and license fee revenues is due to several large funded collaborative arrangements which were entered into during  as well as the continued expansion of our phage display licensing program 
as a result of new collaborations in  our deferred revenues increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
these product development and license fees are amortized over the expected term of each agreement  ranging from one to six years 
cost of products sold in was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenues increased to in from in the increase is primarily due to inventory obsolescence  related to bulk media and component piece parts for older systems  and foreign exchange rate fluctuations  resulting from pounds sterling denominated product sales 
research and development expenses for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from expenditures on new collaborative arrangements  compound manufacturing expenditures for phase i clinical trials of dx  which began in april and increased internal efforts to develop biopharmaceutical  separations and diagnostic products and industrial enzymes 
non cash compensation increased due to the acceleration of vesting of certain restricted stock related to the completion of our initial public offering and a larger spread between the fair market value of the common stock and option exercise prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily due to increased personnel in sales and marketing functions at biotage in connection with the growth in product revenues and in legal  finance and human resources to support corporate administrative functions for our increased research efforts 
there were also increases of approximately  of costs for discontinued merger and acquisition activities and  of additional patent and related legal expenses 
non cash compensation increased due to the acceleration of vesting of certain restricted stock related to the completion of our initial public offering and a larger spread between the fair market value of the common stock and option exercise prices 
net other income increased to million in  from million in  due to a higher average balance available for investment as a result of the proceeds from our initial public offering in august our net loss in was million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources through december   we have funded our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million  including net proceeds of million from our august initial public offering 
we have also generated funds from product revenues  product development and license fee revenues  interest income and other sources 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  a decrease of million from december  our excess funds are currently invested in us treasury obligations 
our operating activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the use of cash in both years resulted primarily from our losses from operations and changes in our working capital accounts  net of depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation expense 
cash used for operating activities increased for the year ended december  primarily due to a reduction in cash received from large funded collaborative arrangements included in deferred revenue 
our investing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our investing activities consisted of purchases of fixed assets 
we estimate that we will invest an additional million in for leasehold improvements to satisfy our facilities requirements for our research activities 
additionally  our biotage subsidiary will continue construction on a  square foot facility in charlottesville  virginia at a cost of approximately million to million  which we plan to finance partially through debt 
we have been approved for a loan of up to million to fund the construction of this facility  subject to the execution and delivery to the bank of related legal documents 
we are required to advance the first million of construction costs prior to drawing down on the loan 
the loan cannot exceed the lower of of the completed appraised value or of actual construction costs 
interest is payable monthly on the amount outstanding until completion of the construction  limited to a maximum of months 
upon completion of the construction or months  the loan will be converted to a term loan and will be repaid over twenty years with interest between and 
the interest rate will be adjusted every five years but may be adjusted earlier if we do not maintain an average non interest bearing compensating balance of  at the lender 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding 
our financing activities provided  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from the employee stock purchase plan  and proceeds from long term obligations  offset by repayments of long term obligations 
we have historically financed fixed asset purchases through capital lease arrangements 
at december   there is an open facility with a lender  but the lender has no obligation to fund any further amounts 
the capital lease obligations are collateralized by the assets sold to the lessor 
the leasehold improvement obligations are currently collateralized by a stand by letter of credit for the amount financed 
if at the end of any quarter  our unrestricted cash is less than the greater of million or annualized cash needs  we must provide to the lender an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount equal to the amount of leasehold improvements financed  which was million at december  annualized cash needs are determined by multiplying the cash used in operations on a consolidated basis for the most recently ended quarter by four 
we believe that we will be able to obtain funding for our future fixed asset purchases through our existing or alternative lenders 
if we cannot obtain additional funding we will have to use our existing cash and cash equivalents to fund future fixed asset purchases 
we currently have a million loan facility available from genzyme corporation that was established as part of the collaboration to bring dx to market 
interest on any outstanding balance accrues at a rate equal to one percent over the prime rate 
there is currently no amount outstanding under this facility 
outlook in  we anticipate total revenues will increase by approximately to 
product revenues should continue to grow at approximately the same rate as product development and license revenues should grow at a more moderate pace  as we focus more on internal research programs rather than on funded collaborative programs 
we expect cost of products sold as a percentage of product revenues to decline  driven primarily by our program of leveraging suppliers and growth in quantity buying 
also  in late  we implemented new oracle material resource planning capabilities  which should improve factory productivity and material planning 
research and development expenses are expected to rise approximately to in the increase is expected to come from a significant expansion of our laboratory facilities  continued progress of our lead compounds through clinical trials  commencement of clinical trials for additional indications for our lead compounds and expanded development of our preclinical pipeline 
growth in selling  general and administrative expenses is expected to slow to approximately to 
statements about our expectations of the period of time through which financial resources will be adequate to support our operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents plus anticipated cash flow from product revenues and existing collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plans through we expect to spend approximately to million in cash during if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations we have long term obligations for fixed asset purchases 
minimum future payments under our long term obligations as of december  are as follows and thereafter total future minimum payments  less amount representing interest  present value of future minimum payments  less current portion  long term obligations  we have non cancelable operating leases in the united states and europe 
minimum future lease payments under these leases as of december  are as follows and thereafter  critical accounting policies the united states securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our accounting policies are described in note in the consolidated financial statements 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
if market value is less than cost  then we write down the related inventory to market value 
if a write down to the current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
our estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the valuation of the excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
at december  and  our inventory balance was million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance net of allowances for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant change relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant industry or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
revenue recognition product revenue is derived from sales of biotage chromatography separations systems and cartridges 
generally  product revenue is recognized upon shipment 
if an installation obligation exists  a portion of revenue equal to the fair value of the installation service is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
for product revenue arrangements that require significant installation services and contain customer acceptance criteria  all revenue is recognized upon the completion of the installation and satisfaction of the customer acceptance criteria 
we enter into product development agreements with collaborative partners for the development of therapeutic  diagnostic and separations products 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable signing fees  funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on product sales derived from collaborations 
non refundable signing fees are recognized as services are performed over the expected term of the collaboration 
funding for research and development  where the amounts recorded are non refundable if research efforts are unsuccessful  is recognized as the related expenses are incurred 
upon achievement of milestones  a portion of the milestone payment equal to the percentage of the collaboration completed through that date is recognized 
the remainder is recognized as services are performed over the remaining term of the collaboration 
royalties are recognized when earned 
significant assumptions and estimates include expected term of the agreement  total expected cost and total expected revenue 
our assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in our estimates could have a material impact on deferred revenue and our results of operations 
at december  and  our deferred revenue related to product development agreements was million and million  respectively 
litigation claims we are engaged in a united states court proceeding relating to patents owned by a third party 
also  two parties have opposed our first phage display patent in europe 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
we record at least the minimum estimated liability related to claims where there is a range of loss and the loss is considered probable 
because of the uncertainties related to the likelihood and amount of loss on any of our pending claims  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending claims and revise our estimates 
future revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the exposure for any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we make every effort to use the best information available to us in determining the level of liability reserves 
as of december   we have no reserves for litigation settlements 
related party transactions our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board also serves as an outside director of and consultant to genzyme corporation genzyme and as an outside director of genzyme transgenics corporation  a company in which genzyme owns approximately 
at december   genzyme owns approximately of our common stock outstanding 
in october  we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement with genzyme for one of our proprietary therapeutic compounds for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases  with initial development to be focused on the treatment of hereditary angioedema 
under the agreement  we funded the first million dollars of development costs 
we have agreed to establish a limited liability company  in which we will own and genzyme will own  and fund equally all development and commercialization costs subsequent to the first million 
genzyme has extended to us a million line of credit  which accrues interest on any outstanding balance at the prime rate plus 
we may use the line of credit to fund a portion of such development costs or for any of our other research and development programs 
at december   we had not utilized any of the available line of credit 
in addition  we will be entitled to receive significant milestone payments and up to of the profits from sales of products developed under this collaboration 
tax loss carryforwards we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income of approximately million as of december   and research credits of approximately million available to offset future federal tax 
included in the million of net operating loss carryforwards is million of net operating loss carryforwards relating to the benefit from the exercise of stock options  which will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates from through as a result of certain acquisitions and stock issued over the past five years  the availability of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
we also have net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes related to our foreign subsidiaries of approximately million as of december   which expire over various periods 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after june  the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will thus be adopted by the company  as required  in fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas and sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or operating results 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will thus be adopted by the company  as required  on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or operating results 
important factors that may affect future operations and results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements appear principally in the sections entitled business and management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
forward looking statements may appear in other sections of this report as well 
generally  the forward looking statements in this report use words like expect  believe  continue  anticipate  estimate  may  will  could  opportunity  future  project  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements include statements about our results of operations  research and development programs  clinical trials  and collaborations 
statements that are not historical facts are based on our current expectations  beliefs  assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections for our business and the industry and markets in which we compete 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
we caution investors not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this report 
these statements speak only as of the date of this report  and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise them  except as required by law 
the following factors  among others  create risks and uncertainties that could affect our future or other performance our history of operating losses and our expectation that we will incur significant additional operating losses  any inability to raise the capital that we will need to sustain our operations  any inability to successfully and expeditiously complete the rigorous clinical trials and regulatory approvals that any biopharmaceutical or diagnostic product candidates that we develop must undergo  which could substantially delay or prevent their development or marketing  our dependence on third parties to manufacture biopharmaceuticals  which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize any biopharmaceuticals we may develop  our lack of experience in conducting clinical trials  regulatory processes  and conducting sales and marketing activities  any or all of which may adversely impact our ability to commercialize any biopharmaceuticals we may develop  our dependence on the expertise  effort  priorities and contractual obligations of our collaborators  any changes in our collaborators business direction or priorities or defaults in their obligations may have an adverse impact on our research revenues and ultimately our license revenues and expenses  any failure by us or our collaborators to gain market acceptance of our biopharmaceuticals  competition and technological change that may make our potential products and technologies less attractive or obsolete  any inability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies  time consuming and expensive proceedings to obtain  enforce or defend patents and to defend against charges of infringement that may result in unfavorable outcomes and could limit our patent rights and our activities  significant fluctuations in our revenues and operating results  which have occurred in the past and which we expect to continue to fluctuate in the future  any loss or inability to hire and retain qualified personnel  difficulties in managing our growth  our dependence on one supplier for a key component in our separations products  risks associated with international sales and operations and collaborations  failure to acquire technology and integrate complementary businesses  our common stock may continue to have a volatile public trading price and low trading volume  and anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and under delaware law and our shareholder rights plan that may make an acquisition of us more difficult 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results  which could materially affect our business  financial position  and stock price 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in exhibit important factors that may affect future operations and results to this form k  which is incorporated into this item by this reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily us treasury funds  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
our short term investments will decline by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase  and therefore  our exposure to interest rate changes is immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
our outstanding debt obligations are all at fixed interest rates and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we have collaboration  technology license agreements and product sales with parties located outside the united states 
transactions under certain other agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
if the exchange rate undergoes a change of up to  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
