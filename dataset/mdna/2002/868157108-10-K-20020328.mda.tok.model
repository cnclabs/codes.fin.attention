see cautionary statements 
acquisition of cardinal holding corp 
on july   we acquired cardinal holding corp 
through its merger with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the merger was treated for accounting purposes as if we were acquired by cardinal in a purchase business transaction 
the purchase method of accounting required that we carry forward cardinal s net assets at their historical book value and reflect our net assets at their estimated fair value at the date of the merger 
accordingly  all historical financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for periods prior to july  reflects only cardinal s historical financial and operating data 
financial and operating data relating to our business are included on and after july  cardinal s historical operating results were substantially different than ours for the same periods 
consequently  analyzing prior period results to determine or estimate our future operating potential would not provide meaningful information

for additional industry segment financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
at december   goodwill amounted to million 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million or diluted earnings per share  as compared to revenue of million and net income before extraordinary loss of million or diluted earnings per share for this increase is the result of an increased demand for our services and our acquisitions 
the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention group segment revenue for our well intervention group for was million  a increase over the segment s gross margin percentage increased to in from in demand and pricing increased for almost all of our services as production related activity was significantly higher throughout most of the year 
in addition to internal growth  our revenue and margin increases can be attributed to acquisitions made in and  which expanded our service offering to include hydraulic drilling and workover services and well control services  as well as a significant expansion of our coiled tubing services 
marine segment revenue for our marine segment for was million  an increase of over the gross margin percentage increased to from as dayrates and utilization for all liftboat classes increased 
the fleet s average dayrate increased over and utilization increased from to 
marine revenue  average day rate and margins benefited from the increased size of our liftboat fleet as a result of our acquisitions and from higher demand for production related services and offshore construction support services 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for was million  increasing over the gross margin percentage increased to in from in the increase in revenue is attributable to higher demand for drilling related tools  such as drill pipe and accessories  gravel packs  high pressure connecting iron  and on site accommodations  and increased exposure to deepwater drilling activity 
also  the segment benefited from additional rentals related to acquisitions made in and field management segment field management revenue for was million  a increase over  and the gross margin percentage increased to in from in this segment experienced increased activity for its contract operations  supplemental labor  offshore construction and fabrication services 
the increased gross margin is attributable to additional platforms and facilities we served in the gulf of mexico 
environmental and other segment revenue from the environmental and other segment increased to million in from million in the gross margin percentage increased to in from in these increases were driven mainly by higher demand for our environmental maintenance services  as well as our offshore and dockside tank and vessel services related to increases in gulf of mexico drilling activity 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in the increase mostly resulted from our larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures during and general and administrative general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from for the percentage decrease is due to increased activity levels and higher pricing for many of our services 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million in the increase is primarily the result of our acquisitions and our increased activity levels 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in income before extraordinary loss of million or diluted earnings per share  as compared to revenue of million and net loss before extraordinary loss of million or diluted loss per share for this increase was the result of an increased demand for our services in all of our operating segments  as well as the cardinal merger and the impact of our acquisitions 
the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention group segment revenue for our well intervention group for was million  a increase over the segment s gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced an increase in gross margin percentage due to increased pricing and improved operating cost efficiency  as well as the cardinal merger and the impact of our acquisitions 
marine segment our marine segment s revenue for was million  an increase of over the gross margin percentage increased to in from in as dayrates and utilization for almost all of our liftboat classes increased 
the fleet also benefited from the acquisition of six liftboats in may and the purchase of one foot leg length liftboat that was delivered to us in september rental tools segment revenue for the rental tools segment for was million  compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from the cardinal merger and our acquisitions  as well as increased pricing and asset utilization 
the gross margin percentage fell to in from in due to a change in the mix of our rental revenue

the gross margin percentage fell slightly to in from in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in most of the increase resulted from our larger asset base as a result of the cardinal merger and our acquisitions 
depreciation also increased as a result of our million of capital expenditures in and our capital expenditures of million 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of the cardinal merger and our acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased to in from in liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million  and we supplemented our cash flow with the issuance of million in senior notes 
our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  we used the cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings to increase our asset base and enhance our earning potential 
in  we made five acquisitions for a total of million in consideration  of which million was paid with common stock 
for two of the acquisitions  additional consideration  if any  will be based upon the respective company s average ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense less certain adjustments for a three year period  and for one acquisition  additional consideration  if any  will be based upon the performance for a two year period of a marine vessel 
additional consideration for these acquisitions  if any  will not exceed million 
these acquisitions expanded our asset base by adding coiled tubing units  eight liftboats ranging from feet to feet in leg length  an expanded line of drill pipe  drill collars  and drill string accessories and services and expanded our business to include well control services and blow out rental tools 
we also made capital expenditures of million during  of which approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory  million was used for the marine segment inclusive of payments for vessel construction and approximately million was used for property expansion  including our new facility in broussard  louisiana 
we also made million of other capital expenditures primarily for our well intervention group  including casing calipers  a high pressure coiled tubing unit  a land conventional coiled tubing unit and construction of new hydraulic drilling units 
we issued million of senior notes due pursuant to an indenture in may on august   we completed the exchange of million of our senior notes due that we registered under the securities act of for all of our outstanding senior notes 
the indenture governing the registered notes requires semi annual interest payments which commenced november  and continue through the maturity date of may  the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  prevents us from incurring additional debt  paying dividends or making other distributions  unless our ratio of cash flow to interest expense is at least to  except that we may incur additional debt in an amount equal to of our net tangible assets  which was approximately million at december   without satisfying this requirement 
the indenture also contains covenants that restrict our ability to create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
in november  we also amended the existing bank credit facility to reduce our original term loan to million  to establish a second term loan in an amount of million and to increase our revolving credit facility to million 
the credit facility bears interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
in march  we made a principal payment of million under our term loans 
as of march   our amounts outstanding under the term loans were million  there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and the weighted average interest on the credit facility was per annum 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our capital expenditures to million in and limits our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to our capital structure  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands description thereafter long term debt operating leases vessel construction total in march  we made a principal payment of million on our term loans  which reduces our and required principal payments by million and million  respectively 
the table does not include any potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of our acquisitions 
additional consideration is generally based on the acquired company s operating performance after the acquisition as measured by earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and other adjustments intended to exclude extraordinary items 
while the amounts payable depend upon the acquired company s operating performance and are difficult to predict accurately  we estimate as of march  that the maximum additional consideration payable for all of our acquisitions was million  with million potentially payable in and million in these amounts are not classified as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles and not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we have no other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
in  we recorded million of additional consideration related to three of our earlier acquisitions  of which million was paid with common stock and million was paid in january from borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in january  we made an acquisition of an environmental company by converting million of notes and other receivables into ownership of the company 
additional consideration  if any  will be based upon a multiple of four times the company s average annual ebitda less million  and paid in in march  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock  including  shares sold pursuant to the underwriter s over allotment option 
the offering generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use the proceeds to repay existing borrowings under our revolving credit facility  to fund asset purchases and for general corporate purposes 
we have identified capital improvement projects that will require up to million in  exclusive of any acquisitions 
we are currently having two new liftboats constructed for a total contract price of million  of which million is expected to be payable in we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued new pronouncements statement  business combinations  statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  and statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
statement  which requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations  applies to all business combinations initiated after june  and to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase period that are completed after june  statement requires that goodwill  as well as other intangible assets be tested annually for impairment and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of statement has not been determined  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million as of january   which will be subject to the transition provisions of statement amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of statement on our financial condition and results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
implementation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact of statement item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we make limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are traded with creditworthy major financial institutions 
at december   we were a party to an interest rate swap agreement with an amount totaling approximately million that was designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the swap matures in october  and the fixed interest rate is 
at december   the interest rate to be received by us averaged 
we consider the swap to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we would have recognized a loss of an estimated  had we terminated these agreements on december  at december   million of our long term debt had variable interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would increase our interest expense inclusive of the swap in the year by approximately  while a decrease would decrease our interest expense by approximately
