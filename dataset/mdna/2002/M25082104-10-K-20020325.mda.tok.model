item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  among others  those statements including the words  expects  anticipates  intends  believes and similar language 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to the risks discussed in the section titled risk factors in this document 
overview prior to  our operations were primarily related to consulting and custom software solutions 
in late  we engaged in a comprehensive reexamination of our strategy and changed our strategic focus to concentrate on providing service optimization software products based on our w service scheduler and techmate technologies 
this change in focus was intended to allow us to license software products useable by multiple clients  rather than developing customized software for each client 
in connection with this change of strategy  we de emphasized our consulting business 
at that time we also spun off our textile software operations to our then existing shareholders and discontinued our defense application business 
since early  we have invested significant resources in developing products based on our w service scheduler and techmate technologies  including increasing the number of our employees involved in research and development  sales and marketing  and professional services 
we believe that in today s economy successful businesses must constantly increase the performance of existing service resources 
our products emphasize the use of optimization tools for performance enhancement in the service environment and also offer the ability to capture the benefits and efficiencies of the internet 
accordingly  in september  we began marketing our product lines under new names  clickschedule and clickfix and in may  we changed our company name to clicksoftware technologies ltd 
we derive revenues from software licensing and service and maintenance fees 
our operating history shows that a significant percentage of our quarterly revenues come from orders placed toward the end of a quarter 
software license revenues are comprised of perpetual or annual software license fees primarily derived from contracts with our direct sales clients and our indirect distribution channels 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  as amended by statement of position under sop  we recognize software license revenues when a software license agreement has been executed or a definitive purchase order has been received and the product has been delivered to our clients  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
service and maintenance revenues are comprised of revenues from implementation  consulting  training  release updates and customer service support fees 
consulting services are billed at an agreed upon rate plus incurred expenses 
clients licensing our products generally purchase consulting agreements from us 
consulting revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement 
customer support is charged as a percentage of license fees depending upon the level of support coverage requested by the customer 
a fee of of license fees is typically charged for five day a week  eight hour coverage and of license fees is typically charged for seven day a week  twenty four hour coverage 
our products are marketed worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force  consultants and various business relationships we have with implementation and technology companies and resellers 
cost of revenues consists of cost of software license revenues and cost of service and maintenance revenues 
cost of software license revenues consists of expenses related to media duplication and packaging of our products and costs of software purchased or licensed for resale 
cost of service and maintenance revenues consists of expenses related to salaries and expenses of our professional services organizations  costs related to third party consultants  and equipment costs 
operating expenses are categorized into research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  and share based compensation 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development  net of grants received from the chief scientist 
in return for some of these grants  we are obligated to pay the israeli government royalties as described below which are included in sales and marketing expenses 
software research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technology feasibility are included in research and development expenses as incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for corporate functions  including information services  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities  legal and costs related to activity as public company 
share based compensation represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the respective exercise price of stock options and the deemed fair market value of the underlying stock 
share based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
interest and other income expenses include interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense  and also includes the effects of foreign currency translations 
the functional currency of our operations is the us dollar  which is the primary currency in the economic environment in which we conduct our business 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses is incurred in new israeli shekels nis and a portion of our revenues and expenses are incurred in british pounds and the european community euro 
the results of our operations are subject to fluctuations in these exchange rates which are influenced by various global economic factors 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations for the years ended december   and were immaterial 
our tax rate will mainly reflect a mix of the us statutory tax rate on our us income  the u 
k statutory tax rate on our u 
k income  the belgium statutory tax rate on our belgium income and the israeli tax rate discussed below 
israeli companies are generally subject to income tax at the rate of of taxable income 
the majority of our income  however  is derived from our company s capital investment program with approved enterprise status under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  and is eligible therefore for tax benefits 
as a result of these benefits  we will have a tax exemption on income derived during the first two years in which this investment program produces taxable income  and a reduced tax rate of for the next to years 
in the event of a distribution of a cash dividend out of retained earnings that were exempt from tax due to its approved enterprise status  we would be required to pay corporate income tax on income from which the dividend was distributed 
all of these tax benefits are subject to various conditions and restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain approval for additional approved enterprise programs  or that the provisions of the law will not change 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  including assessing clients credit worthiness 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
results of operations fiscal years ended december    and revenues 
revenues increased million or to million in  from million in in  revenues increased million or to million from million in in  of our revenues were generated in north america  in europe  in israel and in all other geographic locations asia pacific and africa 
in  of our revenues were generated in north america  in europe  in israel and in asia pacific and africa 
in  of our revenues were generated in north america  in europe  in israel and in asia pacific and africa 
the increase in percentage of revenues from europe and the asia pacific region is largely attributable to an increase in sales by our european subsidiary to customers in europe as well as expansion of our sales effort in europe and the asian pacific region 
software license 
software license revenues were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in the increase in software license revenues was due to increased average sales per client  growth of our client base  and recurring sales to our installed base of clients 
the variability in software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues was due to the fact that while many of our implementations require higher initial service and maintenance  our average deal size also increased  and these factors changed independently of each other 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance revenues were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in the increase in service and maintenance revenues from to is primarily due to the increase in the sale of software licenses 
the relatively small increase in service and maintenance revenues from to was primarily due to an increase in license distribution through third parties also providing implementation  and the release of clickschedule fast track which offers a more rapid implementation of clickschedule reducing the cost of implementation 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in this increase in the cost of revenues on an absolute basis was due to an increased number of clients which resulted in an increased demand for our professional services 
gross profit was in as compared to in and in the change in gross profit percentages are primarily due to both an increase in high margin software license revenues  as well as the improved productivity of our professional services personnel 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software license revenues were  in   in and  in cost of software license revenues were less than of revenues in and and less than of revenues in cost of service and maintenance 
cost of service and maintenance revenues were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in cost of service and maintenance increased by from to while service and maintenance revenues increased by during the same period 
this is directly attributed to the increased service and maintenance productivity and the release of clickschedule fast track which offers a more rapid implementation of clickschedule reducing the cost of implementation 
the increase in the cost of service and maintenance revenues from to was due primarily to an increase in the sale of licenses  which resulted in an increase of million in personnel related costs  an increase of million in third party related costs and an increase of million in other expenses 
the total number of professional services employees employed by us was on december   on december   and on december  operating expenses 
total operating expenses were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in research and development expenses  net 
research and development expenses  net of related grants  were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in we received or accrued grants from the chief scientist in the amount of million in  million in  and million in the decrease in research and development expenses from to is directly attributed to the high costs associated with the introduction of the full optimization suite in the increase in research and development expenses on an absolute basis from to was primarily due to an increase of personnel related costs related to improvements of our clickschedule and clickfix product lines and development of clickplan and clickanalyze as part of our introduction of a complete suite of service optimization management products 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in the decrease in is attributed primarily to cost reductions in our north american operations and overall cost controls 
personnel related costs decreased million  and other expenses decreased million from to the increase in was primarily due to additional sales and marketing efforts related to the new marketing focus for our clicksoftware product line and the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts worldwide during personnel related costs increased million from to and other expenses increased million 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase on an absolute basis in future periods  as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  continue to promote our brand and establish sales in additional geographic areas 
the total number of sales and marketing employees employed by us was on december   on december   and on december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in general and administrative expenses included million in bad debt charges in  million in  and million in we expect that the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses exclusive of bad debt charges will continue to increase as we expand our operations 
share based compensation 
share based compensation for the year ended december  amounted to million 
deferred compensation as of december  amounted to million which will be amortized over the period during which the options vest  generally four years 
share based compensation for the year ended december  amounted to million 
deferred compensation at december  amounted to million 
share based compensation for the year ended december  amounted to million 
deferred compensation as of december  amounted to million 
reorganization costs 
reorganization costs were million or of revenues in these expenses were primarily costs associated with severance payments to terminated employees 
there were no reorganization costs in and interest and other income expenses  net 
interest income net of interest expenses  were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carryforwards  approximately million of us federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million of british net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
the israeli and british net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
the us net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts in the years through preferred share dividend 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded a preferred share dividend of approximately million representing the value of the beneficial conversion feature on the issuance of convertible preferred shares in december the beneficial conversion feature was calculated at the commitment date based on the difference between the conversion price of per share and the estimated fair value of the ordinary shares at that date 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
from inception through our ipo on june   we financed our operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities which through december  totaled approximately million  net of issuance costs 
our initial public stock offering of ordinary shares realized million  net of underwriter discount and other issuance costs 
net cash used in operating activities for each of these years primarily consisted of net losses in addition to increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  amortization of deferred compensation  non cash compensation expenses  depreciation and amortization  as applicable 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was million  comprised of our net loss of million  an increase in trade receivables of million  increase in other receivables of million  decrease in accounts payable of million  decrease in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by non cash charges of million 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was million  comprised of our net loss of million  an increase in trade receivables of million  increase in other receivables of million  increase in accounts payable of million  decrease in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by non cash charges of million 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was million  comprised of our net loss of million  an increase in trade receivables of million  increase in accounts payable of million  increase in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by non cash charges of million net cash provided by investing activities was million in  of which million was provided by investment in short term investments and million invested primarily in leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment and systems  including computer equipment and fixtures and furniture 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  of which million was used to invest in short term investments and million invested primarily in leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment and systems  including computer equipment and fixtures and furniture 
net cash used in investing activities for was million  which was primarily invested in leasehold improvements and purchases of equipment and systems  including computer equipment and fixtures and furniture 
there were no material financing activities in net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in in june  we completed an initial public offering of  ordinary shares at a price of per share 
in july  the underwriters exercised their overallotment option and purchased  additional ordinary shares at a price of per share 
the proceeds to us from the offering were approximately million net of underwriters discount and issuance expenses 
net cash from financing activities during included proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares of million 
as of december  we had outstanding trade receivables of approximately million which represented approximately of total revenues 
as of december  we had outstanding trade receivables of approximately million which represented approximately of total revenues 
as of december   we had outstanding trade receivables of approximately million which represented approximately of total revenues 
our trade receivables typically have to day terms  although we also negotiate longer payment plans with some of our clients 
since inception  we have received aggregate payments from the government of the state of israel in the amount of million related to research and development 
as of december   we have paid or accrued royalties related to these funds in the amount of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have a million unsecured line of credit with an israeli bank 
no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit as of december  we also have an aggregate of  in term loans relating to borrowings for working capital 
we have a loan in us dollars bearing an interest rate of libor plus and a loan in new israeli shekels linked to the israeli cpi  currently bearing an interest rate of 
additional loans bearing an average interest rate of are in british pounds or in us dollars 
our bank in israel has issued two standby letters of credit on our behalf 
one is for  for tenant improvements related to our facilities in israel 
the other is for  and secures our performance pursuant to projects with the government of israel 
additionally  silicon valley bank has issued a letter of credit on our behalf in the amount of  to assure performance under the terms of our campbell  ca lease 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing additional international operations and other factors 
we intend to continue investing significant resources in our sales and marketing and research and development operations in the future 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our expenses until we reach profitability 
however  we cannot assure you that we will attain sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability  particularly given current economic conditions and potential reductions in information technology spending by our current and prospective customers 
we may need to raise additional capital to finance our operations or for strategic purposes  and we may do so by selling additional equity or debt securities or by increasing the size of our credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares  and the terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new rules require business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and goodwill acquired after this date will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
companies are required to adopt sfas no 
for fiscal years beginning after december  we did not complete any business combinations through the year ended december   and as a result these standards are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or operating results 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
although sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
 it retains the requirements of sfas regarding recognition of impairment loss for long lived assets to be held and used based on undiscounted cash flows and resolves certain implementation issues 
also  the accounting model used in sfas for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell is broadened by sfas to include discontinued operations and supersedes apb opinion no 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured on a net realizable value basis and future operating losses will no longer be recognized before they occur 
sfas also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this statement before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares 
if any of the negative events referred to below occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in any such case  the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business the economic outlook may adversely affect the demand for our current products and the company s results of operations 
current predictions for the general economy indicate uncertain economic conditions 
weak economic conditions may cause a reduction in information technology spending generally 
consequently  there may be an adverse impact on the demand for our products  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  predictions regarding economic conditions have a low degree of certainty  and further predicting the effects of the changing economy is even more difficult 
we may not accurately gauge the effect of the general economy on our business 
as a result  we may not react to such changing conditions in a timely manner that may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations 
any such adverse impacts to our results of operations from a changing economy may cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 
we have not achieved profitability 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing and research and development expenses 
some of our expenses  such as administrative and management payroll and rent and utilities  are fixed in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to decreases in revenues 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability  which we may not be able to do 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our share price may decrease 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are not a good measure for comparison 
our operating history shows that a significant percentage of our quarterly revenues come from orders placed toward the end of a quarter 
from time to time  we anticipate a sale of significant size to a single customer 
a delay in the completion of any sale past the end of a particular quarter could negatively impact results for that quarter  and such negative impact could be significant for the delay of a sale of significant size 
even without the delay of a significant sale  our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our ordinary shares may decrease 
the factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include the following the volume and timing of customer orders  internal budget constraints and approval processes of our current and prospective clients  the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  the mix of revenue generated by product licenses and professional services  the mix of revenue between domestic and foreign sources  announcements or introductions of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in prices of and the adoption of different pricing strategies for our products and those of our competitors  timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses  changes in our business and partner relationships  technical difficulties or bugs affecting the operation of our software  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
failure of the market to accept our products would adversely affect our profitability 
historically  all of our operating revenue has come from sales of  and services related to  our clickschedule product and our clickfix product  to clients seeking application software that enables efficient provisioning of services in enterprise environments 
during the year ended december   we introduced three products that  together with our existing products  constitute a suite of products that offers a more comprehensive solution to our customers 
on november  we released version of our service optimization suite that utilizes dynamic load balancing architecture  which dynamically redirects requests among a group of clicksoftware servers running our product applications 
this increases the scalability of our products by enabling our customers to optimize additional resources by adding hardware to this group of clicksoftware servers 
the growth of our company depends in part on the development of market acceptance of these products 
we have no guarantee that the sales of these products will develop as quickly as we anticipate  or at all 
lack of long term demand for our new products would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our sales and implementation cycles depend on factors outside our control  which may cause quarterly license and service fees revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
to date  our customers have taken typically from three months to nine months to evaluate our offering before making their purchase decisions 
in addition  depending on the nature and specific needs of a client  the implementation of our products typically takes two to six months 
sales of licenses and implementation schedules are subject to a number of risks over which we have little or no control  including clients budgetary constraints  clients internal acceptance reviews  the success and continued internal support of clients own development efforts  the efforts of businesses with which we have relationships  the nature  size and specific needs of a client and the possibility of cancellation of projects by clients 
the uncertain outcome of our sales efforts and the length of our sales cycles could result in substantial fluctuations in license revenues 
historically  a significant portion of our sales in any given quarter occur in the last two weeks of the quarter  if sales forecasted from a specific client for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we are unlikely to be able to generate revenues from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of some orders  a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly revenue and operating results 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  revenue and operating results for subsequent quarters could be adversely affected 
failure to expand our sales and marketing organizations could limit our ability to sell additional products and services  which would impair our ability to grow our business and increase revenues 
we are expanding our direct and indirect sales operations to increase market awareness of our products and generate increased revenues 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 
in addition to normal turnover of personnel  we are attempting to expand our direct sales force in asia pacific and africa 
as of december   we employed individuals in our sales and marketing organizations 
because of these sales and marketing personnel joined us within the last twelve months  we will be required to devote significant resources to the training of these new sales personnel 
in addition  we might not be able to hire or retain the kind and number of sales and marketing personnel we are targeting because competition for qualified sales and marketing personnel in our market is intense 
we depend on key personnel  and the loss of any key personnel could affect our ability to compete and our ability to attract additional key personnel may be impaired 
we believe our future success will depend on the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales and marketing  product development and professional services personnel 
dr 
moshe benbassat  our chief executive officer  has individually participated in and has been responsible for overseeing much of the research and development of our core technologies 
at the beginning of  mr 
shimon rojany  our cfo  announced his plan to retire  but has recently decided to indefinitely withdraw his retirement plans 
mr 
rojany is committed to continuing his employment with the company 
the services of dr 
benbassat and other members of our senior management team and key personnel would be very difficult to replace and the loss of any of these employees could harm our business significantly 
we have employment agreements with  among others  dr 
benbassat  mr 
rojany  and mr 
corey leibow  our chief operating officer 
although these agreements request sixty days notification prior to departure  relationships with these officers and key employees are at will 
the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our ability to execute our business strategy and compete 
if we fail to expand our professional services organization  we may not be able to service additional clients and install additional licenses 
we cannot be certain that we can attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified professional services personnel to meet our business needs 
clients that license our software typically engage our professional services organization to assist with the installation and operation of our software applications 
our professional services organization also provides assistance to our clients related to the maintenance  management and expansion of their software systems 
growth in licenses of our software will depend in part on our ability to provide our clients with these services 
in addition  we will be required to expand our professional services organization to enable us to continue to support our existing installed base of customers 
as a result  we plan to increase the number of our service personnel in order to meet these needs 
competition for qualified services personnel with the relevant knowledge and experience is intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we were not able to grow our professional services organization  our ability to expand our service business would be limited 
in addition  we could experience delays in recognizing revenue if our professional services group fails to complete implementations in a timely manner 
if we fail to expand our relationships with third parties that can provide implementation and professional services to our clients  we may be unable to increase our revenues and our business could be harmed 
in order for us to focus more effectively on our core business of developing and licensing software solutions  we need to continue to establish relationships with third parties that can provide implementation and professional services to our clients 
third party implementation and consulting firms can also be influential in the choice of resource optimization applications by new clients 
if we are unable to establish and maintain effective  long term relationships with implementation and professional services providers  or if these providers do not meet the needs or expectations of our clients  we may be unable to grow our revenues and our business could suffer 
as a result of the limited resources and capacities of many third party implementation providers  we may be unable to attain sufficient focus and resources from the third party providers to meet all of our clients needs  even if we establish relationships with these third parties 
if sufficient resources are unavailable  we will be required to provide these services internally  which could limit our ability to meet other demands 
even if we are successful in developing relationships with third party implementation and professional services providers  we will be subject to significant risk  as we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by third party implementation and professional services partners 
our market is highly competitive and any reduction in demand for  or prices of  our products could negatively impact our revenues  reduce our gross margins and cause our share price to decline 
the market for our products is competitive and rapidly changing 
we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies enter the market 
because the market for service and delivery optimization software is evolving  it is difficult to determine what portion of the market each competitor currently controls 
however  competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margin and loss of market share  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
we may not be able to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may harm our business 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations  sales  distribution and other resources than us 
in addition  some of our potential competitors are among the largest and most well capitalized software companies in the world 
failure to fully develop or maintain key business relationships could limit our ability to sell additional licenses that could decrease our revenues and increase our sales and marketing costs 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain business relationships with software vendors  resellers  systems integrators  distribution partners and customers 
if we fail to continue developing these relationships  our growth could be limited 
we have entered into agreements with third parties relating to the integration of our products with their product offerings  distribution  reselling and consulting 
we are currently deriving revenues from these agreements but we may not be able to derive significant revenues in the future from these agreements 
in addition  our growth may be limited if prospective clients do not accept the solutions offered by our strategic partners 
our market may experience rapid technological changes that could cause our products to fail or require us to redesign our products  which would result in increased research and development expenses 
our market is characterized by rapid technological change  dynamic client needs and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technology developments and client requirements  or if our product development or introduction is delayed  we may have lower revenues 
client product requirements can change rapidly as a result of computer hardware and software innovations or changes in and the emergence  evolution and adoption of new industry standards 
for example  we offer windows nt versions of our products due to the market acceptance of windows nt over the last several years 
while we interface smoothly with unix systems  we currently do not provide unix versions of our software 
the actual or anticipated introduction of new products has resulted and will continue to result in some reformulation of our product offerings 
technology and industry standards can make existing products obsolete or unmarketable or result in delays in the purchase of such products 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
we must respond to developments rapidly and continue to make substantial product development investments 
as is customary in the software industry  we have previously experienced delays in introducing new products and features  and we may experience such delays in the future that could impair our revenue and operating results 
our products could be susceptible to errors or defects that could result in lost revenues  liability or delayed or limited market acceptance 
complex software products such as ours often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
in the past  some of our products have contained errors and defects that have delayed implementation or required us to expend additional resources to correct the problems 
despite internal testing and testing by current and potential clients  and despite the history of use by our installed base of customers  our current and future products may contain as yet undetected serious defects or errors 
any such defects or errors could result in lost revenues  liability or a delay in market acceptance of these products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the performance of our products also depends in part upon the accuracy and continued availability of third party data 
we rely on third parties that provide information such as street and address locations and mapping functions that we incorporate into our products 
if these parties do not provide accurate information  or if we are unable to maintain our relationships with them  our reputation and competitive position in our industry could suffer and we could be unable to develop or enhance our products as required 
our intellectual property could be used by third parties without our consent because protection of our intellectual property is limited 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
however  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  which may significantly harm our business 
specifically  we may not be able to protect our trademarks for our company name and our product names  and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult  particularly in countries outside the us  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights 
our end user licenses are designed to prohibit unauthorized use  copying or disclosure of our software and technology in the united states  israel and other foreign countries 
however  these provisions may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions and foreign countries 
unauthorized third parties may be able to copy some portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary 
third parties could also independently develop competing technology or design around our technology 
if we are unable to successfully detect infringement and or to enforce our rights to our technology  we may lose competitive position in the market 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states  israel or elsewhere will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  some of our licensed users may allow additional unauthorized users to use our software  and if we do not detect such use  we could lose potential license fees 
our technology and other intellectual property may be subject to infringement claims 
substantial litigation regarding technology rights and other intellectual property rights exists in the software industry both in terms of infringement and ownership issues 
a successful claim of patent  copyright or trademark infringement or conflicting ownership rights against us could cause us to make changes in our business or significantly harm our business 
we believe that our products do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
however  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in all future intellectual property disputes 
we expect that software products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement or ownership claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties may make a claim of infringement or conflicting ownership rights against us with respect to our products and technology 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  or cause product shipment delays 
further  if an infringement or ownership claim is successfully brought against us  we may have to pay damages or royalties  enter into a licensing agreement  and or stop selling the product or using the technology at issue 
any such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
from time to time  we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
we also indemnify some of our customers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we have only conducted a partial search for existing patents and other intellectual property registrations  and we cannot assure you that our products do not infringe any issued patents 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states and israel are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which would relate to our products 
any future acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in distraction of our management and disruptions to our business 
although not currently under consideration  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
from time to time we may engage in discussions and negotiations with companies regarding our acquiring or investing in such companies businesses  products  services or technologies 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to identify future suitable acquisition or investment candidates  or if we do identify suitable candidates  that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
our management has limited experience in acquiring companies or technologies 
if we acquire or invest in another company  we could have difficulty assimilating that company s personnel  operations  technology or products and service offerings 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  we may incur indebtedness to pay for any future acquisitions 
as of the date of this statement  we have neither begun discussions nor entered an agreement to make any such material investment or acquisition transaction 
future acquisitions may result in dilution to our current shareholders 
in the future we may acquire complementary business through the issuance of additional ordinary shares 
additional issuances of ordinary shares could decrease the value of our ordinary shares and reduce the net tangible book value per share 
consequently  an acquisition in which we issue additional shares could actually decrease the value of your investment in clicksoftware 
as of the date of this statement  we have neither begun discussions nor entered an agreement to make any material acquisition that would result in the issuance of additional shares 
our business may become increasingly susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations 
significant portions of our operations occur outside the united states 
our facilities are located in north america  israel  the european continent  and the united kingdom  and our executive officers and other key employees are dispersed throughout the world 
this geographic dispersion requires significant management resources that may place us at a disadvantage compared to our locally based competitors 
in addition  our international operations are generally subject to a number of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  longer sales cycles  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  expenses associated with customizing products for foreign countries  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  and o political and economic instability 
we expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues and we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales and professional services activities in order to be successful 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to expand our international sales management and professional services organizations  hire additional personnel  customize our products for local markets and establish relationships with additional international distributors  consultants and other third parties 
if we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization  we may fail to meet or exceed our business plan and our revenues may decline 
we are incorporated in israel and have important facilities and resources located in israel  which could be negatively affected due to military or political tensions 
we are incorporated under the laws of the state of israel and our research and development facilities as well as significant executive offices are located in israel 
although substantial portions of our sales currently are to customers outside of israel  political  economic and military conditions in israel could nevertheless directly affect our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
since september  a continuous armed conflict with the palestinian authority has been taking place 
despite our history of avoiding adverse effects  in the future we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
despite past progress towards peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
several arab countries still restrict business with israeli companies  which may limit our ability to make sales in those countries 
we could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel or israeli businesses 
certain of our officers and employees are required to serve in the israel defense forces and this could force them to be absent from our business for extended periods 
david schapiro  our executive vice president  markets and product  and hannan carmeli  our senior vice president  product services and operations  as well as other male employees located in israel are currently obligated to perform up to days of annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
the loss or extended absence of any of our officers and key personnel due to these requirements could harm our business 
we are subject to a recently adopted new companies law  which has not yet been interpreted 
because we are incorporated under the laws of the state of israel  the companies law of israel  which became effective on february   governs your rights as a shareholder 
certain obligations and fiduciary duties of directors  officers and shareholders under the new companies law are new and have not been interpreted or reviewed by the israeli courts 
in addition  not all of the regulations have been promulgated to date 
as a result  our shareholders may have more difficulty and uncertainty in protecting their interests in the case of actions by our directors  officers or controlling shareholders or third parties than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a state or other jurisdiction in the united states 
the rate of inflation in israel may negatively impact our costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the nis against the dollar 
substantially all of our revenues are denominated in dollars or are dollar linked  but a significant portion of our research and development expense is incurred in new israeli shekels nis and a portion of our revenues and expenses is incurred in british pounds and the european community euro 
the results of our operations are subject to fluctuations in these exchange rates which are influenced by various global economic factors  including inflation rates and economic growth within each nation 
in   and in  of our costs were incurred in nis 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar or that the timing of this devaluation will lag behind inflation in israel 
in that event  the dollar cost of our operations in israel will increase and our dollar measured results of operations will be adversely affected 
we are an international company and our international operations are expanding 
our risk exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is increasing  and we may not be able to fully mitigate the risk 
our revenue from the uk has grown both in absolute dollar basis as well as a percentage of total revenues 
we are expanding operations in other areas of europe  and income and expenses recognized in the european community euro will increase 
in  of our costs were incurred in gbp and euro 
we incur a portion of our expenses  principally salaries and related personnel expenses in israel  in nis 
in  of our costs were incurred in nis 
we are also experiencing a growth in revenue and expenses in israel  and we anticipate recognizing revenue from other international sources 
presently our risk to foreign currency fluctuations is minimal  but if our foreign accounts receivable balances increase  the risk will increase 
we cannot assure that we will be able to adequately protect ourselves against such risk 
the government programs in which we currently participate and tax benefits which we currently receive require us to satisfy prescribed conditions and may be delayed  terminated or reduced in the future 
this would increase our costs and taxes 
we receive grants from the government of the state of israel through the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade  or the chief scientist  for the financing of a significant portion of our research and development expenditures in israel  and we may apply for additional grants in the future 
we cannot assure that we will continue to receive grants at the same rate or at all 
the chief scientist budget has been subject to reductions that may affect the availability of funds for chief scientist grants in the future 
the percentage of our research and development expenditures financed using grants from the chief scientist may decline in the future  and the terms of such grants may become less favorable 
in connection with research and development grants received from the chief scientist  we must make royalty payments to the chief scientist on the revenues derived from the sale of products  technologies and services developed with the grants from the chief scientist 
from time to time  the government of israel changes the rate of royalties we must pay  so we are unable to accurately predict this rate 
in addition  our ability to manufacture products or transfer technology outside israel without the approval of the chief scientist is restricted under law 
any manufacture of products or transfer of technology outside israel will also require the company to pay increased royalties to the chief scientist up to 
we currently conduct all of our manufacturing activities in israel and intend to continue doing so in the foreseeable future and therefore do not believe there will be any increase in the amount of royalties we pay to the chief scientist 
currently the office of the chief scientist does not consider the licensing of our software in the ordinary course of business a transfer of technology and we do not intend to transfer any technology outside of israel 
consequently  we do not anticipate having to pay increased royalties to the chief scientist for the foreseeable future 
in connection with our grant applications  we have made representations and covenants to the chief scientist regarding our research and development activities in israel 
the funding from the chief scientist is subject to the accuracy of these representations and covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of these conditions  we could be required to refund payments previously received together with interest and penalties and would likely be denied receipt of these grants thereafter 
we anticipate receiving tax benefits from the government of the state of israel  however these benefits may be delayed  reduced or terminated in the future 
pursuant to the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the government of the state of israel through the investment center has granted approved enterprise status to three of our existing capital investment programs 
consequently  we are eligible for certain tax benefits for the first several years in which we generate taxable income 
we have not  however  begun to generate taxable income for purposes of this law and we do not expect to utilize these tax benefits for the near future 
once we begin to generate taxable income  our financial condition could suffer if our tax benefits were significantly reduced 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are dependent upon the fulfillment of certain conditions and criteria 
if we fail to comply with these conditions and criteria  the tax benefits that we receive could be partially or fully canceled and we could be forced to refund the amount of the benefits we received  adjusted for inflation and interest 
from time to time  the government of israel has discussed reducing or limiting the benefits 
we cannot assess whether these benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us  our officers and directors and the israeli accountants named as experts in this statement or to assert us securities laws claims in israel or serve process on substantially all of our officers and directors and these accountants 
we are incorporated in israel and maintain significant operations in israel 
some of our executive officers and directors and the israeli accountants named as experts in this statement reside outside of the united states and a significant portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult for an investor  or any other person or entity  to enforce a us court judgment against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states  based upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws in an israeli court 
additionally  it may be difficult for an investor  or any other person or entity  to enforce civil liabilities under us federal securities laws in original actions instituted in israel 
we have appointed clicksoftware inc  our us subsidiary  as our agent to receive service of process in any action against us arising out of our original june  initial public offering 
we have not given our consent for our agent to accept service of process in connection with any other claim 
furthermore  if a foreign judgment is enforced by an israeli court  it will be payable in nis 
our officers  directors and affiliated entities own a large percentage of our company and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
as of december   our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding ordinary shares 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
these actions may be taken even if our other investors oppose them 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of israeli corporate and tax law and of our articles of association may have the effect of delaying  preventing or making more difficult merger or other acquisition of us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  any merger or acquisition of us will require the prior consent of the chief scientist 
israeli law regulates mergers  votes required to approve a merger  acquisition of shares through tender offers and transactions involving significant shareholders 
in addition  our articles of association provide for a staggered board of directors and for restrictions on business combinations with interested shareholders 
any of these provisions may make it more difficult to acquire our company 
accordingly  an acquisition of us could be delayed or prevented even if it would be beneficial to our shareholders 
other ordinary shares may be sold in the future 
this could depress the market price for our ordinary shares 
as of december   we had  net of  shares held in treasury  ordinary shares outstanding  including shares held by a trustee for issuance under outstanding options 
in addition  as of december   we had  ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options  and  additional ordinary shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our stock option plans and employee share purchase plan 
if our existing shareholders or we sell a large number of our ordinary shares  the price of our ordinary shares could fall dramatically 
restrictions under the securities laws limit the number of ordinary shares available for sale by our shareholders in the public market 
we have filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our stock option plans 
our need for additional financing is uncertain  as is our ability to raise further financing if required 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our expenses until we reach profitability 
however  we cannot assure you that we will attain sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability  particularly given current economic conditions and potential reductions in information technology spending by our current and prospective customers 
we may need to raise additional capital to finance our operations or for strategic purposes  and we may do so by selling additional equity or debt securities or by increasing the size of our credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares  and the terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
if the economy continues to weaken or  for any other reason  we are unable to meet our business goals  we may have to raise additional funds to respond to business contingencies and may include the need to fund additional marketing expenditures  develop new or enhance existing products and services  enhance our operating infrastructure  hire additional personnel  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or necessary technologies  or fund more rapid expansion 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our products and services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
additionally  prior to the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities to entities outside of israel  we will need to obtain approval from the chief scientist of the state of israel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain this consent in the future 
if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company  our united states shareholders will be subject to adverse tax consequences 
if  for any taxable year  either  or more of our gross income is passive income or or more of the fair market value of our assets  including cash even if held as working capital  produce or are held to produce passive income  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company pfic for united states federal income tax purposes 
we do not believe that we currently are a pfic nor do we anticipate that we will be characterized a pfic in the future  but  if we do  our shareholders will be subject to adverse united states tax consequences 
if we were to be treated as a pfic  our shareholders will be required  in certain circumstances  to pay an interest charge together with tax calculated at maximum rates on certain excess distributions including any gain on the sale of ordinary shares 
in order to avoid this tax consequence  they may be permitted to make a qualified electing fund election however the company does not currently intend to take the action necessary for our shareholders to make a qualified electing fund election  in which case  in lieu of such treatment they would be required to include in their taxable income certain undistributed amounts of our income or may elect to mark to market the ordinary shares and recognize ordinary income or possible ordinary loss each year with respect to such investment and on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares 
prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences applicable to them of investing in our ordinary shares 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
in particular  we have operations in the san francisco bay area  an area that is known to be susceptible to the risk of earthquakes 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stock price could be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile 
the price at which our ordinary shares trades is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as announcements of technological innovations  announcements relating to strategic relationships  conditions affecting the software and internet industries  trends related to the fluctuations of stock prices of companies such as ours  our historical and anticipated quarterly and annual operating results  variations between our actual results and the expectations of investors or published reports or analyses of clicksoftware  announcements by us or others affecting our business  systems or expansion plans  and general conditions and trends in technology industries 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we develop products in israel and sell them primarily in north america and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as most of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material losses as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
due to the short term nature of our term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
additionally  although we do not presently participate in hedging contracts related to foreign currency exchange rates  we may do so in the future to protect against rate fluctuations affecting our foreign currency accounts receivable balances 
we do not participate in any speculative investments 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million which consist of cash and highly liquid short term investments 
our short term investments will decline in value by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase  and  therefore  our exposure to interest rate changes has been immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
as of december   we had total short term debt of  and long term debt net of current maturities of  which bear interest at rates that are linked to libor or the israeli consumer price index 
as of december  we had million unsecured line of credit
