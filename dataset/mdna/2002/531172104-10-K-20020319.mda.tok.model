item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  the company continued to focus on creating value and increasing profitability and cash flow 
with respect to its core portfolio of properties in operation  the company endeavors to maintain and increase its occupancy levels while increasing rental rates 
the company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield high returns 
the company also acquires properties which it believes will provide high returns and create long term value  and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations 
this income is substantially influenced by rental demand for the properties in operation 
the general slowdown in the economy has negatively affected occupancy rates  primarily in the higher paying office portion of the portfolio 
the occupancy rate of the properties in operation decreased to as of december  from as of december   and the occupancy rate of the office portfolio decreased to as of december  from as of december  rental operations have been negatively impacted by occupancy declines 
this decline is partially offset by rental rate increases the company has realized on renewal and replacement leases 
to the extent this trend continues  the company may experience little to no increase in same store property level operating income 
the company also seeks to achieve growth in operating income from its development pipeline activity 
the decline in demand for real estate has also impacted the pre leasing of the properties under development and has resulted in a decrease in the number of development starts during the year ended december  if this trend continues  the contribution to growth in income from properties under development may decline

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market

these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately  if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates  the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
