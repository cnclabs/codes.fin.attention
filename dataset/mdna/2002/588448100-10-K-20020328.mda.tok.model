item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
actual performance and results of operations may differ materially from those projected or suggested in the forward looking statements due to certain risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  i the fact that the company s success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in vermont and vermont s ability to attract new business  ii the fact that the company s earnings depend to a great extent upon the level of net interest income the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings generated by the bank and thus the bank s results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates  iii the fact that the banking business is highly competitive and the profitability of the company depends upon the bank s ability to attract loans and deposits in vermont  where the bank competes with a variety of traditional banking and nontraditional institutions such as credit unions and finance companies  iv the fact that at december  a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio was comprised of commercial loans  and that of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans both commercial and residential  exposing the company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk  the value of underlying collateral  including real estate  and other more intangible factors  which are considered in making commercial loans 
accordingly  the company s profitability may be negatively impacted by errors in risk analyses  by loan defaults  and the ability of certain borrowers to repay such loans may be adversely affected by any downturn in general economic conditions 
these factors  as well as general economic and market conditions  may materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of the company s common stock 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
the forward looking statements contained herein represent the company s judgment as of the date of this form k  and the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses which is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair value of properties to be foreclosed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
refer to the discussion of reserve for loan losses in the credit quality and reserve for loan losses section and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the reserve for loan losses

as part of the annual credit policy review process  targets are set by loan type for the total portfolio 
the past year continued the trend of balancing the loan portfolio between commercial loan types commercial  commercial real estate and construction and residential real estate 
since residential real estate outstandings have grown by million and now comprise of the total portfolio compared to at the end of commercial loan categories including commercial real estate have remained relatively flat since and have shrunk to of total loans in compared to in the increase in residential real estate loans can be attributed to management s decision in to retain all home mortgage loans originated in portfolio  and favorable long term interest rate markets that existed during parts of  and as of december   the average loan size in the residential portfolio is thousand with a weighted average term of months 
as residential real estate loans have increased  commercial real estate loans have remained flat 
this shift is a function of management s desire to decrease commercial real estate exposure in the loan portfolio 
commercial real estate loans dropped from of the portfolio in to in during most of management believed the market yields on commercial real estate loans did not offer acceptable risk adjusted returns  and as a result this portion of the portfolio decreased million during commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased by million during  management has emphasized these loans instead of commercial real estate based upon the more desirable risk adjusted yields and credit risk profiles 
total commercial loans have remained stable over the past five years at approximately to of total loans 
the decrease in installment loans during resulted from the sale of the bank s million credit card portfolio during october the bank currently services million in residential mortgage loans for investors such as federal government agencies fnma and fhlmc and for financial investors such as insurance companies and pension funds located outside vermont

credit quality and reserve for loan losses stringent credit quality is a major strategic focus of the bank 
the success of this effort is evidenced by the bank s consistently low levels of problem assets 
the following table summarizes the bank s nonperforming assets npas as of december   through december  in thousands nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans total nonperforming loans      other real estate owned total nonperforming assets      npl to total loans npa to total loans plus oreo excluded from the balances above are approximately million of internally classified loans 
this is a significant increase from million of internally classified loans at december  the primary reason for the increase is the number of commercial loan relationships which were downgraded to substandard during the year as the economy in the bank s primary markets slowed 
the bank has been conservative in its approach to grading relationships 
management believes that these loans have well defined weaknesses which  if left unattended  could lead to collection problems 
management maintains an internal listing that includes these loans 
the list is reviewed and updated monthly 
the oversight process on these loans includes an active risk management approach 
a management committee reviews the status of these loans each quarter and determines or confirms the appropriate risk rating and accrual status 
the findings of this review process are instrumental in determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
discussion of events affecting nonperforming assets historically  the bank has worked closely with borrowers to collect obligations and pursued more vigorous collection efforts where necessary 
the bank s credit department and loan workout functions provide resources to address collection strategies for nonperforming assets 
in thousands nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans other real estate owned   total      significant events affecting nonperforming assets are discussed below 
nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans decreased from million at december   to million at december   despite the previously described increase in internally classified loans 
one significant commercial relationship million was removed from nonaccrual status in  as the property securing the loan was transferred to oreo 
during management identified million in loans it perceived as having certain risks  which were transferred to nonaccrual status 
these transfers were offset by continued resolution of nonaccrual accounts 
approximately thousand in loans were returned to accrual status  principal payments of approximately million were collected  and approximately thousand of charge offs further decreased the balance of nonaccrual loans 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest the bank generally places loans that become or more days past due in nonaccrual status 
if  in the opinion of management  the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured  loans may continue to accrue interest and be left in this category 
included in this category are loans which have reached maturity and have not been renewed on a timely basis  for reasons other than financial capacity to pay 
balances of loans or more days past due and still accruing were zero at the end of restructured loans restructured loans decreased from thousand at december   to thousand at december   reflecting scheduled amortization of loans 
other real estate owned the bank continues to aggressively market oreo 
the balance of oreo decreased from thousand at december   to thousand at december  the only significant addition during the year was the previously mentioned million property that was transferred to oreo during the second quarter and sold during the fourth quarter of policies and procedures related to the accrual of interest income the bank normally recognizes income on earning assets on the accrual basis  which calls for the recognition of income as earned  rather than when it is collected 
the bank s policy is to classify a loan days or more past due with respect to principal or interest as a nonaccruing loan  unless the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccruing loans  and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is typically charged against current income 
a loan remains in nonaccruing status until the factors which suggest doubtful collectibility no longer exist  the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the reserve for loan losses 
in those cases where a nonaccruing loan is secured by real estate  the bank can  and usually will  initiate foreclosure proceedings 
the result of such action will either be to cause repayment of the loan with the proceeds of a foreclosure sale or to give the bank possession of the collateral in order to manage a future resale of the real estate 
foreclosed property is recorded at the lower of its cost or estimated fair value  less any estimated costs to sell 
any cost in excess of the estimated fair value on the transfer date is charged to the reserve for loan losses  while further declines in market values are recorded as an expense in other noninterest expense in the statement of operations 
loan portfolio monitoring the bank s board of directors grants each loan officer the authority to originate loans on behalf of the bank  subject to certain limitations 
the board of directors also establishes restrictions regarding the types of loans that may be granted and the distribution of loan types within the bank s portfolio  and sets loan authority limits for each lender 
these authorized lending limits are reviewed at least annually and are based upon the lender s knowledge and experience 
loan requests that exceed a lender s authority require the signature of the bank s credit division manager  senior loan officer  and or the bank s president 
all extensions of credit of million or greater to any one borrower  or related party interest  are reviewed and approved by the loan committee of the bank s board of directors 
using a variety of management reports  the bank s loan portfolio is regularly monitored by the board of directors and credit department 
the loan portfolio as a whole  as well as individual loans  are reviewed for loan performance  creditworthiness  and strength of documentation 
the bank has hired an external loan review firm to assist in monitoring both the commercial and residential loan portfolios 
during the external commercial loan review firm reviewed approximately in dollar volume of the bank s commercial loan portfolio 
credit risk ratings are assigned to commercial loans at origination and are routinely reviewed 
all loan officers are required to service their loan portfolios and account relationships 
as necessary  loan officers or the loan workout function take remedial actions to assure full and timely payment of loan balances 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses rll is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date 
the bank reviews the adequacy of the rll at least quarterly 
factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the reserve include previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and their effect on the borrowers  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of properties to be foreclosed 
the adequacy of the reserve is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  consisting of a review of the following key elements a specific reserve for loans identified as impaired  a general reserve for the various loan portfolio classifications  the unallocated reserve as part of the bank s analysis of the specific reserve  detailed and extensive reviews are done on larger credits and problematic credits identified on the watched asset list  nonperforming asset listings and internal credit rating reports 
loans are evaluated for impairment by looking at the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or measuring the net present value of the expected future cash flows using the loan s original effective interest rate 
when the difference between the fair value of the collateral  for collateral dependent loans  or the net present value of a loan is lower than the recorded investment of the loan  the difference is reflected with a resulting specific reserve 
loans deemed impaired at december   totaled million 
as of december   the related reserve was thousand 
the general reserve is a percentage based reflection of historical loss experience and assigns a required reserve allocation by loan classification based on a fixed percentage of all outstanding loan balances 
the general reserve employs a risk rating model that grades loans based on their general characteristics of credit quality and relative risk 
for pass rated loans  appropriate reserve levels are estimated based on judgments regarding the historical loss experience  current economic trends  trends in the portfolio mix  volume and trends in delinquencies and non accruals and off balance sheet credit risk 
as of december   the related reserve was million 
for loans risk rated special mention or substandard  the reserve allocation is increased  as of december   the related reserve was million 
in addition to the specific and general components  there is an unallocated reserve that recognizes a measurement imprecision in the valuation and general components of the reserve and management s evaluation of various other conditions not measured in the specific and general components  including the following general economic and business conditions affecting the company s key lending areas  credit quality trends  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments as of december   the unallocated reserve was thousand  down from million at december  the bank reviewed its methodology for calculating required reserves at the end of and adjusted the general reserve factors to reflect a broader time period 
additionally  factors for certain large relationships were increased 
these changes  as well as an increase in criticized loans resulted in a higher general reserve and a lower unallocated reserve 
losses are charged against the rll when management believes that the collectibility of principal is doubtful 
to the extent management determines the level of anticipated losses in the portfolio has significantly increased or diminished  the rll is adjusted through current earnings 
overall  management believes that the rll is maintained at an adequate level  in light of historical and current factors  to reflect the level of credit risk in the loan portfolio 
loan loss experience and nonperforming asset data are presented and discussed in relation to their impact on the adequacy of the rll 
the following table reflects the bank s loan loss experience and activity in the rll for the past five years 
in thousands average loans outstanding      rll beginning of year      charge off commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage  installment credit cards total loans charged off    recoveries commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage  installment credit cards total recoveries    net loan charge offs recoveries   provision for possible loan losses charged to operations    rll end of year      rll to total loans net loan charge offs recoveries to average loans as of december   the company s reserve ratios were of nonperforming assets and of total loans 
during the fourth quarter of the bank recorded a thousand negative provision for loan losses 
this negative provision  combined with the bank s practice of recording loan loss recoveries as an offset to the loan loss provision in the consolidated statement of operations  resulted in an overall negative provision of million for the bank will continue to take all appropriate measures to restore nonperforming assets to performing status or otherwise liquidate these assets in an orderly fashion so as to maximize their value to the company 
there can be no assurances that the bank will be able to complete the disposition of nonperforming assets without incurring further losses  or that the bank will continue to recognize substantial recoveries such as those received during the last five years 
the level of recoveries correlates closely to total charge offs 
as the level of total charge offs has declined so has the amount of total annual recoveries 
risk management management and the board of directors of the company are committed to sound risk management practices throughout the organization 
the company has developed and implemented a centralized risk management monitoring program 
risks associated with the company s business activities and products are identified and measured as to probability of occurrence and impact on the company low  moderate  or high  and the control or other activities in place to manage those risks are identified and assessed 
periodically  department level and senior managers re evaluate and report on the risk management processes for which they are responsible 
this documented program provides management with a comprehensive framework for monitoring the company s risk profile from a macro perspective  while also serving as a tool for assessing internal controls over financial reporting as required under the fdicia 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to a movement in interest rates  which could affect the company s net interest income 
it is the responsibility of the alco to manage interest rate risk which arises naturally from imbalances in repricing  maturity and or cash flow characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of members of senior management  meets frequently to review and develop asset liability management strategies and tactics 
the alco is responsible for ensuring that the board of directors receives timely  accurate information regarding the bank s interest rate risk position at least quarterly 
techniques used by the alco take into consideration the cash flow and repricing attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet items and their relation to possible changes in interest rates 
the alco manages its interest rate exposure primarily by using on balance sheet strategies  generally accomplished through the management of the duration  rate sensitivity and average lives of the company s various investments  and by extending or shortening maturities of borrowed funds  as well as carefully managing and monitoring the pricing of deposits 
the alco also uses off balance sheet strategies  such as interest rate caps and floors  to help minimize the bank s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco uses an outside consultant to perform rate shocks of its balance sheets  and to perform a variety of other analyses for the committee 
the consultant s most recent review was as of november  at that time  in addition to modeling a basis point rate shock  the consultant ran a basis point rate shock in an increasing rate environment  with a flattening yield curve 
these types of dynamic analyses give the alco committee a more thorough understanding of how the bank s balance sheet will perform in a variety of rate environments 
the bank has established a target range for the change in net interest income  given a basis point change in interest rates  of zero to 
as of december   through the use of such computer models  the change in net interest income for the months ending december   from the company s expected or most likely forecast is as follows net interest rate change income sensitivity up basis points 
down basis points the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit run off rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will likely differ due to the varying impact of changes in the balances and mix of loans and deposits differing from those assumed  the impact of possible off balance sheet hedging strategies  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect all actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
the model used to perform the balance sheet simulation assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve over twelve months and reprices every interest bearing asset and liability on the bank s balance sheet 
the model uses contractual repricing dates for variable products  contractual maturities for fixed rate products  and product specific assumptions for deposits such as freedomlynx r accounts and money market accounts which are subject to repricing based on current market conditions 
investment securities with call provisions are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of a call 
the model also assumes that the rate at which certain mortgage related assets prepay will vary as rates rise and fall  prepayment estimates are derived from the office of thrift supervision net portfolio value model 
the company has entered into interest rate cap and floor contracts  from time to time  to mitigate the effects on net interest income in the event interest rates on variable rate deposits rise or rates on variable rate loans decline 
no interest rate cap or floor contracts were outstanding at december  or the bank sold interest rate caps with a notional amount of million in february the resulting gain of thousand was accreted into income over the remaining life of the sold caps 
the company s interest rate sensitivity gap gap is pictured below 
interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s on and off balance sheet positions 
gap is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified periods 
an asset sensitive position positive gap indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within a specified time period  which would imply a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position negative gap generally implies a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
there are certain limitations inherent in a static gap analysis 
these limitations include the fact that it is a static measurement and that it does not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and interest bearing deposits may respond non proportionally to changes in market interest rates 
although the alco reviews all assumptions used in the model in detail  assets and liabilities do not always have clear repricing dates  and loans and deposits may reprice earlier or later than assumed in the model 
repricing date one day over six one year to six months to to five over five in thousands months one year years years total assets loans      mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations      us treasury agency securities   other securities including securities purchased under resale agreements     other assets   total assets      liabilities and stockholders equity noninterest bearing deposits   interest bearing deposits     borrowed funds   other liabilities   long term debt    stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity      cumulative gap    gap as a of total earning assets based on historical experience and the bank s internal repricing policies  it is the bank s practice to present repricing of statement savings  savings deposits and freedomlynx r and now account balances in the one to five year category 
the bank s experience has shown that the rates on these deposits tend to be less rate sensitive than other types of deposits 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the alco 
in this capacity the alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
credit risk a network of loan officers manages credit risk  with review by the bank s credit department and oversight by the bank s board of directors 
the board of directors grants each loan officer the authority to originate loans on behalf of the bank and establishes policies regarding loan portfolio diversification and loan officer lending limits 
the bank s loan portfolio is continuously monitored  through the use of a variety of management reports and with the assistance of an external loan review firm  for performance  creditworthiness and strength of documentation 
credit ratings are assigned to commercial loans and are routinely reviewed 
when necessary  loan officers or the loan workout function take remedial actions to assure full and timely payment of loan balances 
the bank s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans when scheduled payments become contractually past due or more days and the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful

liquidity and capital resource management liquidity  as it pertains to banking  can be defined as the ability to generate cash in the most economical way to satisfy loan and deposit withdrawal demand  and to meet other business opportunities that require cash 
sources of liquidity for banks include short term liquid assets  cash generated from loan repayments and amortization  borrowing  deposit generation and earnings 
the merchants bank has a number of sources of liquid funds  including million in available federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks at year end  an overnight line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb of million  an estimated additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of million  and the ability to borrow approximately million through the use of repurchase agreements  collateralized by the bank s investments  with certain approved counterparties 
the bank s investment portfolio  which totaled million at december   is actively managed by the alco and is a strong source of cash flow for the bank 
the portfolio is fairly liquid  with a weighted average life of years  and is available to be used as a source of funds  if needed 
contractual obligations the company has certain long term contractual obligations  including long term debt agreements  operating leases for branch operations  and time deposits 
the maturity schedules for these obligations are as follows one year four years less than to three to five over five in thousands one year years years years total debt maturities    operating lease payments  time deposits     commitments and off balance sheet risk the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
such instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the contractual amounts of these financial instruments at december  are as follows in thousands contractual amount financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to originate loans  unused lines of credit  standby letters of credit  loans sold with recourse equity commitments to low income housing limited partnerships  commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to lend generally have expiration dates within days of the commitment 
unused lines of credit have expiration dates ranging from years from the date of the commitment 
since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on an individual basis 
the amount of collateral obtained by the bank upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower  in accordance with lending policy  and an appropriate amount of real and or personal property is obtained as collateral 
standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
most guarantees extend for less than two years  and most individual guarantees are for less than thousand 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank obtains real and or personal property as collateral for those commitments for which collateral is deemed to be necessary 
equity commitments to low income housing partnerships represent funding commitments by the bank to certain limited partnerships 
these partnerships were created for the purpose of acquiring  constructing and or redeveloping affordable housing projects 
the funding of these commitments is generally contingent upon substantial completion of the project  none extend beyond the th anniversary of substantial completion 
capital resources capital growth is essential to support deposit and asset growth and to ensure the strength and safety of the company 
net income increased the company s capital by million in  million in  and million in payment of dividends decreased the company s capital by million  million and million during  and  respectively 
stock repurchases decreased the company s capital by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulatory agencies 
to be considered adequately capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must maintain minimum levels of tier leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital 
the company and the bank were above all regulatory minimums and considered well capitalized by the regulators at december  the ratios for the company are set forth below minimum to be well capitalized under regulatory in thousands amount percentage guidelines tier risk based capital  total risk based capital  tier leverage capital  in january the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
in january of the board of directors voted to extend the program until january under the program the company is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of its own common stock 
as of december   the company had purchased thousand shares of its own common stock on the open market  at an average per share price of  under the program 
related party transactions the company engages in banking transactions with certain of its directors and officers  and certain of their associates 
the company obtains these services on terms that are substantially the same as those that we would obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
during the bank obtained legal services from a firm associated with one of its directors totaling thousand 
additionally  the bank purchased computer equipment and project management services totaling thousand from a firm associated with one of its directors 
at december  the bank had loans outstanding to directors  executive officers  and associates of such persons totaling million 
it is the policy of the bank to make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable lending transactions with other persons 
effects of inflation the financial nature of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  but inflation does affect the company because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total bank assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation
