comprehensive loss not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by approximately  or when compared to fiscal the total revenue increase consists of an increase in the disease management segment of approximately  or compared to fiscal offset by a decrease in medical equipment sales of approximately  or compared to fiscal the increase in revenues from to primarily resulted from an increase in total membership from health plan contracts for our disease management business segment to approximately million members for fiscal compared to approximately  members for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of new health plan contracts signed and implemented during fiscal and at november   of the  plan members under contract  we had  commercial members and  medicare choice members 
revenue for medicare choice members are significantly higher than commercial members 
we did not have a significant number of medicare choice members in fiscal we expect to have a slightly higher percentage of medicare choice membership in fiscal  and  if this occurs  increases in revenue may result primarily from this change in membership mix 
we expect revenue growth for to continue to increase over as a result of additional members enrolled under our existing contracts as well as anticipated new health plan contracts during fiscal during fiscal  we sold unused state net operating loss carryforwards for cash by way of the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program through our ihmc subsidiary 
we received approximately  from this transaction 
we also had remaining tax benefits  which were sold as part of the program during fiscal in which we received approximately gross profit margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of revenue growth in the disease management segment 
during fiscal we were able to contract with different plans within the same geographic area which also assisted in improving gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended november  increased by approximately  or when compared to fiscal the increase includes a non recurring charge of  associated with an executive employee s compensation expense and severance payment 
without this charge  selling general and administrative expenses would have increased by approximately  or when compared to the increase primarily resulted from an increase in salaries and benefits associated with increased staff to support the higher levels of members enrolled in our disease management programs  incentive payments for new contracts and achievement of targeted performance goals 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we add more health plan contracts  increase staffing levels and increase employee compensation associated with improvement of operating performance 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal by approximately  or when compared to fiscal the increase is primarily the increase in staffing levels in our information technology department 
we have dedicated these resources primarily on new product software development and upgrades to existing technology in order to support our current operations  new disease states managed and the increased volume of patients associated 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by approximately  or compared to fiscal during fiscal  we added a substantial volume to our disease management segment  increasing this segments revenues to approximately  from approximately  or by when compared to the prior year 
the system has demonstrated cost effective outcomes while improving the health status of the patient 
subsequent to year end we added  members to our disease management segment and have executed an agreement to cover an additional  members beginning in the second quarter of the capital equipment segment of our business showed a decline in revenues of approximately  or 
during fiscal  we sold unused state net operating loss carryforwards for cash through the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we received  from this transaction 
debt conversion expense for the fiscal year ended november  was reported in the amount of  this non cash charge resulted from the conversion of the remaining  of debt held by the galen funds to equity at a price of per share rather than the conversion price of originally set at the time the note was issued 
without the debt conversion expense  net losses for the year ended november  would have been  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
gross profit margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the revenue increase in the disease management segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended november  increased by approximately  or when compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increased selling activity related to the disease management segment as well as increases in administrative functions supporting enrollment of disease management patients 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately  or when compared to the prior year 
we have focused these efforts on product software development as well as upgrading existing technology to support new diseases and a larger volume of patients 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our principal sources of working capital have been provided by proceeds from public and private placements of securities and the sale of certain assets 
since our inception  issuance of securities and sale of assets have generated approximately  less applicable expenses 
in march and april we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock to two private investors for approximately  net of expenses 
on april   the remaining  principal amount of notes relating to a private placement in  plus accrued interest of  was converted into  shares of common stock 
on april  we sold  shares of common stock for approximately  to three investors led by galen partners iii  lp as part of this transaction  we also extended the terms on outstanding warrants to november  working capital was  at november  compared to  at november  and ratios of current assets to current liabilities are and as of november  and  respectively 
the working capital increase of approximately  was primarily due to the equity investment of galen partners iii  lp totaling approximately on september  we entered into a loan agreement with first union national bank for a line of credit of million 
the annual interest rate is the lower of the bank s reference rate minus or the libor market index rate plus 
the entire million is currently available 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with cash and investments  and available credit under our credit line should be sufficient to fund our current level of growth 
however  to the extent the expansion of our operations requires significant additional resources or certain forms of financial guarantees to assure our performance under the terms of new health plan contracts  we may be required to seek additional financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us 
additional factors that may affect future results future operating results 
future operating results  which reflect management s current expectations may be impacted by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated herein 
these factors include worldwide economic and political conditions  terrorist s activities  industry specific factors  our ability to maintain access to external financing sources and its financial liquidity  the acceptance of our disease management system by health plan organizations  and our ability to manage expense levels 
need for additional capital 
as of november   we had approximately  cash and short term investments 
while we have experienced negative cash flows since fiscal we expect to have positive cash flow beginning in fiscal nevertheless  our future success is highly dependent upon our continued access to capital markets  which we believe are necessary for the continued support of our growth 
in the event we are unable to maintain access to our existing financing sources  or obtain other sources of financing  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
as demand for our services has increased in recent periods  our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the timing of contracts signed and programs implemented during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our sales  research and development costs 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems  and problems with the redesign and implementation of these new systems could interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to enhance our current systems in order to improve our operating effectively and expand the range of disease management services we offer 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
as part of this effort  we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to manage our business operations 
failure to smoothly and successfully implement this and other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run our business 
in addition  any failure or significant downtime in our legacy or new information systems could prevent us from efficiently implementing disease management programs  reconciling cost savings and could harm our business 
if we do not introduce successful new disease management services in a timely manner  our services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
our services are for industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to o properly identify customer needs  o innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  o successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  o differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  o price our services competitively  and o anticipate our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past year  and our attrition rate has dropped  there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including o the retention of key employees  o the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  o the retention of key customers  and o the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits from such transactions  our financial position results and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to curtail operations  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant federal  state and local  health and safety  health information disclosure  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
litigation regarding patents or intellectual property could be costly and time consuming 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share
