item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of whitman and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and in conjunction with forward looking statements  business risks appearing at the end of item in that certain statements made in this item are qualified by the risk factors set forth in that section 
general through three wholly owned subsidiaries  we currently operate schools in states offering a range of graduate  undergraduate and non degree certificate or diploma programs primarily in the fields of healthcare  information technology and business to more than  students 
we are organized into a university degree division and an associate degree division 
the university degree division offers primarily doctorate  master and bachelor degrees through colorado tech 
the associate degree division offers associate degrees and diplomas or certificates through sanford brown and uds 
revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees paid by students 
the majority of our students rely on funds received from title iv programs to pay for a substantial portion of their tuition 
accordingly  a majority of our revenues are indirectly derived from title iv programs 
instructional and educational support expenses consist primarily of costs related to the educational activity of our schools 
instructional and educational support expenses include salaries and benefits of faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel 
instructional and educational support expenses also include occupancy costs  costs of books sold  and depreciation and amortization of equipment costs and leasehold improvements 
selling and promotional expenses consist primarily of advertising costs  production costs of marketing materials  and salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in student recruitment  admissions  and promotional functions 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  depreciation  bad debt  amortization of intangibles  and other related costs for departments that do not provide direct services to students 
effective april   in compliance with sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization but rather reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain statement of operations data to net revenues for the periods indicated year ended march  net revenues costs and expenses instructional and educational support selling and promotional general and administrative legal settlement total costs and expenses income from operations other income and expenses interest expense interest income loss on huron investment income loss before income tax provision benefit and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision benefit income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss year ended march  compared to the year ended march  net revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to a increase in average student enrollment and an increase in tuition rates 
the associate degree division experienced a increase in average student enrollment and the university degree division experienced a increase in average student enrollment 
the increase in student enrollment in the associate degree division was primarily due to increased enrollment in the medical assisting program and the health information specialist program offered by uds and the information technology and allied health programs offered at sanford brown 
the increase in student enrollment in the associate degree division was due to our improved marketing and admissions efforts which permitted us to increase the rate at which we converted leads to new student starts 
instructional and educational support expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  instructional and educational support expenses decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the increase in instructional and educational support expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll expenses and related benefits for faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel to support the increase in enrollment 
the decrease in instructional and educational support expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due to our ability to better leverage our instructional and educational support expenses to support an increased revenue base 
selling and promotional expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in selling and promotional expenses as a percentage of net revenues was due to our ability to maintain such expenses relatively unchanged while supporting a growth in revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses remained consistent at for the years ended march  and the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in administrative payroll expenses and related benefits and an increase in bad debt expense 
as a percentage of net revenues  bad debt expense increased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  the increase in bad debt expense was primarily due to the negative impact of the october required adoption of the department of education s new methodology for calculating the amount of previously disbursed federal student financial aid that we must return to the federal government with respect to students who have since withdrawn from our schools 
this new regulation increases the student s obligation to the school from which they have withdrawn and decreases the amount of student federal financial aid received by the school on behalf of the student who withdrew 
we reported income from operations of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
this increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in income from operations of million in the associate degree division which was partially offset by a decrease in income from operations in the university degree division of million 
we reported net income of million for the year ended march  and a net loss of million for the year ended march  the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in profitability in the associate degree division  losses sustained in the prior year relating to the sale of our minority ownership of huron university  which resulted in a loss after taxes of million  and the implementation of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
effective april   which resulted in a one time charge after taxes of million 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  which was sold in august  net revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to a increase in average student enrollment and an increase in tuition rates 
excluding huron university  the university degree division experienced a increase in average student enrollment 
average student enrollment in the associate degree division remained relatively unchanged 
the increase in student enrollment in the university degree division was primarily due to increased enrollment at colorado tech s sioux falls campus and in colorado tech s information technology programs 
instructional and educational support expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  instructional and educational support expenses decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  excluding huron university  instructional and educational support expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  as a percentage of net revenues  instructional and educational support expenses increased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  this increase in instructional and educational support expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in the university degree division and million in the associate degree division 
the increase in instructional and educational support expenses in the university degree division was primarily due to increases in payroll and related benefits for faculty and student support personnel to support the increase in enrollments and an increase in expenses related to the start up of colorado tech s online program 
the increase in instructional and educational support expenses in the associate degree division was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related benefits for faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel at uds to support an increase in enrollment 
selling and promotional expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses increased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  excluding huron university  selling and promotional expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and promotional expenses increased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  this increase in selling and promotional expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses in the associate degree division resulting from our marketing efforts directed at increasing enrollment 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  excluding huron university  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  excluding huron university  as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a reduction in administrative payroll expenses and consulting fees in the university degree division 
the decrease in these expenses was partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense 
as a percentage of net revenues  bad debt expense increased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  bad debt expense was negatively impacted by the october required adoption of the department of education s new methodology for calculating the amount of previously disbursed federal student financial aid that we must return to the federal government with respect to students who have since withdrawn from our schools 
this new regulation results in an increase in the student s obligation to the school from which they have withdrawn that will not be paid by federal student financial aid funds 
we reported income from operations of million for the year ended march  as compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended march  excluding huron university  income from operations decreased by million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this decrease in profitability was primarily due to a decrease in income from operations of million in the university degree division due to an increase in expenses related to the start up of colorado tech s online program 
on april   huron university was sold to a not for profit college by the investor group that acquired it from us 
colorado tech recorded a one time non recurring non cash charge of approximately million or per diluted share in the fiscal quarter ended march  relating to the sale of its minority ownership of huron university 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations divestiture of huron university 
we reported net losses of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in net loss was primarily due to the loss of million  after taxes realized in fiscal in connection with the sale of our minority ownership of huron university and the implementation of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
effective april   which resulted in a one time charge after taxes of million 
these losses were partially offset by operating losses of million sustained at huron university in fiscal prior to the divestiture of this campus in august divestiture of huron university in  we sold the huron  south dakota  campus of huron university to a group of investors  including members of the campus management team 
in connection with the transaction  we contributed the operating assets of the school  certain of its liabilities and  in cash to the purchaser and agreed to guarantee a portion of the assumed liabilities 
we also retained a minority interest in the school 
we extended a loan of  to the campus president to assist him in funding the transaction 
the terms of the transaction were established through an arm s length negotiation  and we recorded no gain or loss 
we recorded our minority investment in the school at a cost of approximately million  which then approximated fair value 
we recorded the investment under the cost method due to our inability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the purchaser 
on april   the investor group sold the school to a not for profit college 
this transaction released us from any further obligations associated with the school  including our guarantee 
we did not receive any proceeds from this transaction  and recorded a one time non recurring non cash charge of approximately million in the fiscal quarter ended march  relating to our minority ownership of the school 
our loan of  to the former campus president remained outstanding after the sale 
the loan is due in august with monthly interest payments at the prime rate which commenced in october the loan is secured by  shares of our common stock owned by the former campus president 
the not for profit college that purchased the school has also agreed to guarantee this loan 
in october  the loan went into default by virtue of the failure of the required monthly interest payments to be made and we accelerated all amounts due under the loan 
in may  we received a default judgment against the not for profit college that guaranteed the loan and are commencing collection efforts to enforce the judgment 
we believe the collateral securing the loan is adequate and  therefore  have elected not to take action against the principal obligor of the loan at this time 
seasonality we experience seasonality in our quarterly results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
new enrollment in our schools tends to be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters because these quarters cover periods traditionally associated with the beginning of school semesters 
costs are generally not significantly affected by the seasonal factors on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  quarterly variations in net revenues will result in fluctuations in income from operations on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at march   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our working capital totaled million at march   million at march  and million at march  net cash of million was provided by operating activities in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal and million from fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to an increase in net profits of million  a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to an increase in net profits of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in deferred income taxes of million 
net cash of million was used for investing activities in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal and million from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to our investment of million in huron university in fiscal we estimate that the capital expenditures expected to be incurred during fiscal will approximate million 
these anticipated capital expenditures primarily relate to the costs associated with the acquisition and upgrade of equipment for the schools and the relocation and upgrade of campus facilities 
funds required to finance such capital expenditures are expected to be obtained from funds generated from operations 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in fiscal  an increase in cash used of million from fiscal and million from fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal was due to an increase in net payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in march  our million credit facility was restructured into a million line of credit and a million capital expenditure term note 
in november  we extended the expiration date on the million line of credit to october  we intend to further extend the expiration date on our line of credit prior to october  or  in the alternative  to seek a replacement credit facility 
at march   we had no outstanding balance under this facility and letters of credit outstanding of million which reduced the amount available for borrowing 
the million term note is payable in seven monthly installments of interest only commencing on april  and thereafter in monthly installments of principal and interest with a balloon payment due in april the amounts borrowed under this facility were used for capital expenditures in prior years 
our primary source of operating liquidity is the cash received from payments of tuition and fees 
most students attending our schools receive some form of financial aid under title iv programs  and a majority of our revenue is derived from title iv programs 
uds  sanford brown and colorado tech receive approximately  and of their funding  respectively  from the title iv programs 
disbursements under each program are subject to disallowance and repayment by the schools 
we believe that given our working capital  our cash flow from operations and our line of credit  we will have adequate resources to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
numerous risks and uncertainties could affect our short term and long term liquidity 
see forward looking statements  business risks for discussion of material factors that could affect our liquidity 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period within after total year years years years note payable     capital lease obligations    operating leases      we have a contractual commitment related to a million line of credit which expires on october  we intend to further extend the expiration date on our line of credit prior to october  or  in the alternative  to seek a replacement line of credit 
at march   we had no outstanding balance under this facility and letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced the amount available for borrowing 
transactions with former management we purchase certain textbooks and materials for resale to our students from an entity that is owned by randy s 
proto  our former chief operating officer and president 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  we purchased approximately   and  respectively  in textbooks and materials from that entity 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income and other tax accruals  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments by management and uncertainties  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
although historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using management s estimates  as discussed below  our financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are the primary areas where financial information is subject to the use of management s estimates  assumptions and the application of management s judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements  and some of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
revenues  accounts receivable and deferred tuition revenue revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees paid by students 
approximately of our net revenues collected during the fiscal year ended march  were received from students who received funds from title iv programs to pay for their tuition 
we charge our students for the full contract amount at the beginning of the course  the academic year  or the academic term  as applicable  resulting in the recording of an account receivable and a corresponding deferred tuition revenue liability 
the deferred tuition revenue liability is reduced and recognized into income over the term of the relevant period being attended by the student 
if a student withdraws from a course or program  the unearned portion of the program that the student has paid for is refunded generally on a pro rata basis 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our students and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying various expected loss percentages to certain student account receivable categories based on historical bad debt experience 
we charge off accounts receivable balances deemed to be uncollectible usually after they have been sent to a collection agency and returned uncollected 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of losses that we have in the past 
furthermore  because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from the title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces title iv program funding or the ability of our schools or students to participate in the title iv programs could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that have resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
prior to april  we amortized the goodwill associated with these acquisitions using the straight line method  principally over a forty year period and evaluated the realizability of the goodwill periodically to determine if the carrying amount was recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their estimated useful lives 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under the new rules  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
effective april   we elected to early adopt sfas during september  we completed our transitional impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas as a result of this test  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for this asset not previously recorded which would adversely impact our operating results for the period in which we made the determination 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at march   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
during the year  we determined that it is more likely than not that million of those assets will be realized although realization is not assured  resulting in a valuation allowance of  at march  new accounting pronouncements on december   the securities exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  to provide guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab outlines basic criteria that must be met before we may recognize revenue  including persuasive evidence of the existence of an arrangement  the delivery of products or services  a fixed and determinable sales price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
sab became effective beginning the first fiscal quarter of the first fiscal year beginning after december  prior to the release of sab  our revenue recognition policy was in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
effective april   we implemented sab and changed the method by which we recognize revenue for laboratory and registration fees charged to a student 
in fiscal  we began recognizing revenue for these fees ratably over the life of an education program 
previously  we recognized laboratory and registration fees as revenue at the beginning of our academic term or year  as applicable 
we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting of approximately  net of taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life 
rather  goodwill will be subject to  at least  an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
whitman elected to adopt the provisions of sfas and effective april  application of the nonamortization provision of sfas resulted in an increase in net income of  net of taxes  for the year ended march  during september  the company completed its transitional impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas as a result of this test  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also retains the requirement under apb to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
while the technical corrections to existing pronouncements are not substantive in nature  in some instances  they may change accounting practice 
the provisions of this standard related to sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may  all other provisions of this standard must be applied for financial statements issued on or after may   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk related to our variable rate line of credit and capital expenditure term note as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at march   our variable rate long term debt had a carrying value of million 
the fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value because the variable rates approximate market rates 
a increase in the period end interest rate would not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition
