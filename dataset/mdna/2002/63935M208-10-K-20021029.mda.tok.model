fiscal operating plan fiscal year has been a challenging year for the technology industry and the telecommunications and it services market in particular 
in fiscal year  we executed a plan to restructure our business model and our business operations 
over the course of the year  we raised new financing  restructured our operating leases and fixed cost infrastructure contracts to significantly reduce excess capacity  implemented labor efficiencies  managed out non productive customers  eliminated low margin product lines  and divested a non core business 
as a result  we have reduced our revenue requirement for ebitda break even from million per quarter at july  to million per quarter in july   while improving the quality of our service delivery  customer satisfaction and our publicly available and industry leading operating metrics 
during the fiscal year  we have systematically reduced our run rate cash burn from million per month in fourth quarter fiscal year to million per month in fourth quarter fiscal year further  as we have shifted our business model away from a return on our physical infrastructure to one focused on generating a return on our managed services platform  such as ip  software infrastructure and work processes  we expect to leverage the capital investments already made without significant new capital requirements going forward 
for fiscal year  although we still expect some churn in our revenue base  primarily driven by pricing pressures in the marketplace  we believe that we have a fundamentally healthier base of customers 
for fiscal year  we expect lower annual revenue than fiscal year we are forecasting revenues stabilizing in the first half of fiscal year and we expect net revenue growth in the second half of fiscal year however  because of our restructuring efforts  we now have a flexible cost structure that allows us to match costs with actual revenue levels 
therefore  in fiscal year  absent unforeseen circumstances  we expect to achieve sustained stand alone run rate ebitda profitability

under sab  installation fees are recognized over the life of the related customer contracts 
prior to fiscal year  we recognized installation fees at the time the installation occurred 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on all prior years resulted in a million increase in net loss for the year ended july  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
revenue for the year ended july  includes million that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
the million of fiscal year revenue was primarily attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenue on customers lost during fiscal year total revenue for fiscal year decreased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal year included in fiscal year revenue is approximately million in non recurring revenue from settlements primarily from related parties 
excluding settlement revenue  total revenue for fiscal year decreased to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents year the decrease in fiscal year revenue  net of settlement revenue  resulted from a million  or  decrease in unaffiliated revenue combined with a million  or  decrease in revenue from affiliated customers of cmgi 
during fiscal year  we lost customers  with an estimated million in annual revenues  inclusive of contract termination fees 
as of july   we had unaffiliated and affiliated customers of cmgi  as compared to unaffiliated customers and affiliated customers of cmgi at july  as a percentage of revenue  unaffiliated revenue for fiscal year increased to of total revenue  from of total revenue for fiscal year net of settlement revenue  unaffiliated revenue for fiscal year increased to of total revenue  from of total revenue for fiscal year our revenue from related parties principally consists of sales of services to cmgi and other customers that are cmgi affiliates 
in general  in pricing the services provided to cmgi and its affiliates  we have negotiated the services and levels of service to be provided  calculated the price of the services at those service levels based on our then current standard prices  and  in exchange for customer referrals provided to us by cmgi  discounted these prices by 
we sold services to cmgi and cmgi affiliates totaling approximately million  or of revenue in fiscal year and million  or of revenue in fiscal year in fiscal year one of these customers accounted for approximately of revenue  as compared to fiscal year where four of these customers accounted for approximately   and of revenue  respectively 
as of july   cmgi owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
on september   cmgi sold its equity and debt holdings 
total revenue for fiscal year increased to approximately million  from approximately million in fiscal the increase in revenue is due primarily to an increase of approximately million of revenue related to the new unaffiliated customers in fiscal year and additional business with both existing unaffiliated customers  and affiliated customers of cmgi 
revenue from unaffiliated customers increased to approximately million or of total revenue  from approximately million or of total revenue for fiscal year the number of unaffiliated customers decreased to at july  from as of july  for fiscal year  although we still expect some churn in our revenue base  primarily driven by pricing pressures  we believe that we have a fundamentally healthier base of customers 
for fiscal year  we expect lower annual revenue than fiscal year we are forecasting revenues stabilizing in the first half of fiscal year and we expect net revenue growth in the second half of fiscal year as new revenue does not include equipment and other hardware rentals  slower new revenue growth is partially offset by a higher percentage of services  which have higher margins 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits for operations personnel  bandwidth fees and related internet connectivity charges  equipment costs and related depreciation and costs to run our four data centers  such as rent and utilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  a restructuring plan was approved and the costs to shut down our two original data centers were accrued as part of the restructuring costs 
as a result of the restructuring plan  the financial periods before august include the costs of the two original data centers and the financial periods subsequent to july do not 
our fourth quarter fiscal year restructuring plan  combined with our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies has resulted in significantly lower cost of revenue levels for fiscal year  excluding impairment charges of million related to long lived assets  as compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment charge related to certain leased and owned equipment and long lived assets 
the million charge has been shown as a separate component of cost of revenue in fiscal year cost of revenue in dollars increased to approximately million in fiscal year  from approximately million in fiscal year included in cost of revenue are impairment charges of 
table of contents million and million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
excluding the impairment charges  cost of revenues decreased approximately to million in fiscal year  from approximately million in fiscal year the million value decrease  net of impairment charges  resulted from a million reduction in equipment lease and related costs  a million reduction in labor costs due to a head count reduction from at july  to at july   a million reduction in consultants  a million reduction in bandwidth and bandwidth related costs  a million reduction in rent costs related to the shut down of our original data centers on july   and a million reduction in other facility and equipment related costs offset by a million increase in depreciation resulting from the purchase of certain equipment formerly held under operating lease 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year net of impairment charges  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year cost of revenue in dollars increased to approximately million in fiscal year  from approximately million in fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal year the dollar value increase is due primarily to the costs associated with increased investment in our data centers 
these costs principally include labor and headcount expenses  additional equipment and maintenance costs and increased bandwidth 
included in the fiscal year cost of revenue is a charge of approximately million related to certain equipment under operating leases  which has been deemed not to have a future economic benefit to us 
for fiscal year  we are anticipating that the cost of sales will decrease from the fiscal year levels on both an absolute and a unit cost basis 
however  because of our restructuring efforts  we believe that we now have a flexible cost structure that allows us to match costs with actual revenue levels 
further  because of the fixed cost nature of our business  and the economies of scale achieved by spreading the various layers of expertise and software tools and infrastructure across more customers  each new dollar of revenues is marginally more profitable 
during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to certain leased and owned equipment and other long lived assets 
the components of this charge are as follows navisite performed a physical inventory of its customer dedicated equipment 
as a result of this inventory  navisite recorded an impairment charge of million for obsolete equipment and for equipment no longer on hand and identified certain excess assets not in use 
navisite modified the payment amounts and terms of certain operating leases with three equipment vendors such that the modified leases qualify as capital leases 
one of the resulting capital leases is payable in monthly payments of  starting in december the second capital lease has total payments of million  of which million was paid in the second quarter of fiscal year and million is payable in january the third capital lease is payable in monthly payments of  for the first four months and  for the remaining months  starting in april the equipment under all resulting capital leases was capitalized at the fair market value of the equipment at the time of the modification  million  which was lower than the present value of the future minimum lease payments based on navisite s estimated incremental borrowing rate of 
since the fair market value of the equipment was less than the consideration given  based on a third party appraisal  navisite recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately million 
in addition  navisite returned certain equipment held under certain operating leases with one of the above lessors and incurred and paid a breakage fee of  navisite recorded a net million charge representing the future estimated remaining minimum lease payments related to certain idle equipment held under various operating leases 
the equipment had previously been rented to former customers under operating leases  and upon the loss of the customer  the equipment became idle 
based on our forecasts  the equipment will not be utilized before the related operating leases expire and or the equipment becomes obsolete 

table of contents navisite evaluated the current and forecasted utilization of its purchased software licenses 
as a result of this evaluation  during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a  impairment for software licenses that would not be utilized before the licenses expired and or became obsolete 
navisite finalized agreements with various equipment lessors whereby we purchased equipment previously held under operating leases for approximately million 
the fair market value of the equipment at the time of purchase  based on third party appraisal  was approximately million 
as the aggregate fair market value of the equipment  based on third party appraisal  was less than the aggregate consideration given  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million  as a separate component of cost of revenue  in fiscal year a number of factors occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal impacted our long lived assets including both our expected future cash flow generation and our expected utilization of the assets within revised operating plans 
these factors included the further deterioration of market conditions within the web hosting industry  excess capacity in the industry and in our two data centers  our anticipated data center utilization and our revised business model 
based on these factors and their impact on current and future projected cash flows  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the conclusion of this assessment was that the decline in market conditions within our industry were significant and other than temporary 
in this assessment  we reviewed our long lived assets  which included property  equipment and goodwill 
the carrying amount of goodwill  which totaled  was considered unrecoverable and was written off as of july  and was included as a component of general and administration expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the measurement of the impairment loss of property and equipment was based on the fair value of the asset  as determined by third party appraisal 
management determined that the best measure of fair value for the property and equipment was a combination of the market and cost approaches 
the cost approach was utilized to determine the fair value of certain computer hardware  leasehold improvements  office furniture and equipment and construction in progress 
the cost approach utilizes estimated replacement reproduction cost  with allowances for physical depreciation and functional obsolescence ie asset utilization 
for certain equipment and leasehold improvements  the market approach was used 
the market approach typically includes comparing recent sales of similar assets and adjusting these comparable transactions based on factors such as age  condition  and type of sale to determine fair value 
based on the appraised fair value of the property and equipment  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross margin gross margin decreased to approximately a negative of total revenue for fiscal year from approximately a negative of total revenue for fiscal year net of impairment charges  gross margin improved to approximately a negative of total revenue for fiscal year from approximately a negative of total revenue for fiscal year this compares with an improvement in gross margin to approximately a negative of total revenue for fiscal year  from approximately a negative of total revenue for fiscal year the improvement in the gross margin is a direct result of our fourth quarter fiscal restructuring and our ongoing restructuring efforts 
we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to improve as we realize the full impact of our fiscal year cost savings initiatives in fiscal year operating expenses product development 
product development expenses consist mainly of salaries and related costs 

table of contents product development expenses decreased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  product development decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the dollar value decrease in product development expenses is primarily related to reduced headcount and related costs resulting from the decrease in product development personnel at july  to from at july   combined with a reduction in outside consultants

we terminated employees on july  the restructuring charge also included approximately million of costs related to the closing of our two original data centers 
the components of the facility closing costs included approximately million of estimated lease obligations associated with restoring the facilities to their original condition  and other contractual obligations  to be paid over the term of the respective agreements through  and approximately million of write offs of leasehold improvements  which were recorded as of july  during fiscal year  we were able to favorably renegotiate the facility closing costs 
the accrual for the two original data centers was reduced by approximately million and the bandwidth termination costs were reduced by approximately million 
in addition   in severance employee costs were forfeited by former employees 
as a result  we reversed approximately million in restructuring accrual during fiscal year as of july   we had completed the restructuring plan and made all related payments

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july   comprised primarily of million received through the issuance of convertible notes payable to cmgi and hpfs offset by payments under capital lease obligations and notes payable 
in connection with an agreement dated october  among us  cmgi and hpfs  we purchased certain equipment with a fair market value of million  previously leased by us from hpfs under operating lease agreements expiring through  in exchange for a note payable in the face amount of approximately million 
as the fair market value of the equipment  based on a third party appraisal  was less than the associated debt obligation  we recorded an asset impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of million 
we recorded the assets purchased and associated impairment charge effective august  with a corresponding obligation to hpfs 
based on the terms of the million obligation  interest accrues commencing on november  we recognized million of interest expense in fiscal year on november   in connection with the october  agreement  we received million and million in cash from hpfs and cmgi  respectively  in exchange for six year convertible notes payable in the face amounts of million and million to hpfs and cmgi  respectively  making the total notes payable issued by navisite to hpfs and cmgi  approximately million and million  respectively 
the convertible notes require payment of interest only  at per annum  for the first three years from the date of issuance and then repayment of principal and interest  on a straight line basis  over the next three years until maturity on the sixth anniversary of the date of issuance 
at our option  we may make interest payments i in shares of our common stock  in the case of amounts owed to cmgi  through december and ii approximately in shares of our common stock  in the case of amounts owed to hpfs  through december the payment of interest in our stock requires that we be listed for trading on the nasdaq national market 
at july   we were listed on the nasdaq smallcap market and therefore must make of the interest payments in cash or receive a waiver from the holders of the notes for the nasdaq national market requirement 
the convertible notes payable are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and cannot be prepaid 
the principal balances of these convertible notes may be converted into our common stock at the option of the holders at any time prior to or at maturity at a conversion rate of per share

the value of the beneficial conversion rights is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the convertible notes payable 
holders of the convertible notes payable are entitled to both demand and piggyback registration rights and hpfs is entitled to anti dilution protection under certain circumstances 
the agreement with hpfs and cmgi also contains certain restrictive covenants  including but not limited to limitations on the issuance of additional debt  the sale of equity securities to affiliates and certain acquisitions and dispositions of assets 

table of contents subsequent to july   we had not paid the interest payable on the convertible notes due on september  we were also no longer listed on the nasdaq national market and were instead listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
pursuant to the convertible notes  this new listing on the nasdaq smallcap market requires us to seek clearblue s prior written consent before paying interest and principal in the form of common stock 
on october   we received a waiver from clearblue permitting the payment of interest to be made in the form of stock consistent with our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market and waiving any noncompliance of timely payments of interest or principal 
in august we paid the interest due to clearblue 
in fiscal year  we issued  shares of common stock in satisfaction of accrued interest associated with the million notes payable to cmgi and hpfs 
in fiscal year  we modified the payment amounts and terms of certain operating leases with three equipment vendors such that the modified leases qualify as capital leases 
one of the resulting capital leases is payable in monthly payments of  starting in december the second capital lease has total payments of million  of which million was paid in fiscal year and million is payable in january the third capital lease is payable in monthly payments of  for the first four months and  for the remaining months  starting in april in addition during fiscal year  we returned certain equipment held under certain operating leases with one of the above lessors and incurred and paid a breakage fee of  we currently anticipate that our available cash resources at july  will be sufficient to meet our needs on a standalone basis for working capital and capital expenditures through the end of fiscal year our projections for cash usage assume our ability to retain customers in light of market and navisite uncertainties  our ability to obtain a waiver for the cash payments of all or a portion of fiscal year quarterly interest due on the million convertible notes  our ability to collect accounts receivables in a timely manner  and our ability to achieve expected cash expense reductions 
in addition  clearblue and navisite are evaluating the possibility of a business combination involving clearblue  its affiliate entities and navisite 
clearblue is our majority stockholder and could unilaterally implement any such combinations 
the parties currently have no plans for such a combination and its impact  if implemented  on our cash resources cannot be determined 
further  continued market uncertainties  including delays or restrictions in it spending  may affect our business results and our projected use of cash could also be impacted by any merger or acquisition activity 
to address these uncertainties  management is working to quantify the potential impact on cash flows of its evolving relationship with clearblue  continue our practice of managing costs  and aggressively pursue new revenue through channel partners  direct sales and acquisitions 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to respond to competitive and industry pressures  to respond to operational cash shortfalls  to acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies  or to develop new  or enhance existing  services or products 
in addition  on a long term basis  we may require additional external financing for working capital and capital expenditures through credit facilities  sales of additional equity or other financing vehicles 
our ability to raise additional funds may be impacted by the de listing of our stock from nasdaq  our inability to transfer back to the nasdaq national market in the future from the nasdaq smallcap market  and restrictions imposed on us by clearblue 
under our arrangement with clearblue we must obtain its consent in order to issue debt securities or sell shares of our common stock to affiliates 
we may not receive clearblue s consent 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  respond to competitive pressures  or continue as a going concern  would be significantly limited 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of our business  we enter into contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment and the purchase of minimum bandwidth 
in addition  we had million face value of long term debt outstanding at july  future payments required under these long term obligations are as follows payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on debt capital leases operating leases bandwidth commitments level agreement maintenance for hardware and software property leases total critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
revenue recognition 
we provide outsourced web hosting and managed application services and related professional and consulting services 
revenue consists of monthly fees for web site and internet application management  application rentals  and hosting 
revenues related to monthly fees for web site and internet application management  application rentals and hosting are recognized over the term of the customer contract based on actual usage and services 
fees charged for the installation of customer equipment are generally received in advance and are deferred and recognized as revenue over the life of the related customer contract  typically to months 
in the event a customer terminates the agreement prior to its stated maturity  all deferred revenue related to installation services is automatically recognized upon the effective date of the termination  and we generally charge cancellation or termination fees that are also recognized upon the effective date of the termination 
cancellation fees are calculated as the customer s remaining base monthly fees obligation times the number of months remaining in the contract term 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined subsequent to our initial evaluation and at any time during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
due to the nature of our service arrangements  we provide written notice of termination of services  typically days in advance of disconnecting a customer 
revenue for services rendered during this notification period is recognized on a cash basis as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral or other security against trade receivables 
our customer base includes a significant number of small start up internet based businesses that face increased risk of loss of 
table of contents funding depending on the availability of private and or public funding 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve for of the balance over days old and of all other customer balances 
this method historically approximated actual write off experience 
changes in economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  due to significant industry and economic trends affecting both our current and future operations as well as a significant decline in our stock price  we completed an impairment review of our property and equipment 
this review included a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to the estimated fair values of the specific assets 
management determined that the best measure of fair value for the property and equipment was a combination of the market and cost approaches 
the cost approach was utilized to determine the fair value of certain computer hardware  leasehold improvements  office furniture and equipment and construction in progress 
the cost approach utilizes estimated replacement reproduction costs  with allowances for physical depreciation and functional obsolescence ie  asset utilization 
for certain equipment and leasehold improvements  the market approach was used 
the market approach typically includes comparing recent sales of similar assets and adjusting these comparable transactions based on factors such as age  condition  and types of sale to determine fair value 
based on the appraised fair value of the property and equipment  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the selection of valuation methodologies and approaches  as well as assumptions of future asset utilization  requires judgments and estimates 
the use of different valuation methodologies or assumptions could have increased or decreased the impairment charge 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents 
we invest our cash primarily in money market funds 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense on capital lease obligations due to the fixed nature of such obligations 
we also have fixed rate notes payable to cmgi and hpfs 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have an impact on these notes 
these notes were subsequently sold to clearblue 
we do not currently have any foreign operations and thus are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
