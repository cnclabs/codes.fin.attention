these products are targeted for commercial manufacturing in one of the company s commercial sites 
page albemarle corporation and subsidiaries agrichemical intermediates are sold to chemical companies that supply finished products to farmers  governments and others 
these products include orthoalkylated anilines for the acetanilide family of pre emergent herbicides used on corn  soybeans and other crops and organophosphorus products for insecticide use 
in  the epa initiated a program that will phase down the home use end market products over a five year period that use albemarle s organophosphorus agrichemical intermediates 
in  the company absorbed the impact of some of these products that were voluntarily withdrawn 
the company continues to expand its bromine production capabilities with the anticipated completion in late of a bromine unit and facilities for production of calcium bromide  sodium bromide and hydrogen bromide in safi  jordan with albemarle s joint venture partner  the arab potash company limited 
the company continued its expansion of brine field and bromine capacities at the company s magnolia  arkansas  facility that it started in the result of the current phase of the program will be an approximate bromine production capacity increase over year end 
uv curing business  acquired by acquisition in  includes a complete line of additives initiators  synergists  and inhibitors supporting primarily the printing and laminates markets 
this industry is rapidly growing as uv cured coatings provide a more environmentally friendly coating solution than solvent based coatings 
the company s subsidiary  albemarle ppc appc  operates a plant in thann  france 
appc is one of the world s largest producers of organic and inorganic brominated compounds used mainly in pharmaceutical  photographic and agricultural chemical intermediates 
appc also operates an electrolysis unit to produce high purity caustic potash and potassium carbonate used in the glass  water treatment  cleaning product and food industries 
appc strengthens the company s position in fine chemicals and provides additional manufacturing capabilities in europe 
in polymer chemicals product lines  most of the company s plants operated at considerably lower capacity utilization in than during  however  the aluminum alkyls plants operated at rates similar to in the fine chemicals product lines  most plants operated at somewhat lower rates in than during  with the exception of the ibuprofen and inorganic bromides plants  which operated near capacity 
the company operates on a worldwide basis with i manufacturing plants located in france  germany and the united kingdom  in addition to facilities in the united states  and has interest in certain joint venture production facilities in japan  peoples republic of china and austria  ii offices and distribution terminals in belgium  france  japan and singapore  as well as the united states and iii offices in shanghai and beijing  china 
the company does not believe it has significant assets in countries in which those assets would be deemed to be exposed to substantial risk 
see note  operating segments and geographic area information of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on page competition the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of other companies in most of its product lines 
some markets involve a significant number of competitors  while others involve only a few 
the competitors of the company are varied in terms of size  resources and market share 
competition generally is based on product performance and availability  reputation for quality  price and customer service and support 
the degree and nature of competition depends on the type of product involved 
in general  the company competes on the basis of the quality and price of its products as well as customer services by maintaining a broad range of products and by focusing resources on products in which the company has a competitive advantage 
the company endeavors to improve its reputation for quality products  competitive prices and excellent customer service and support 
competition in connection with the company s products requires continuing investments in research and development  product and process improvements and specialized customer services 
through research and development  the company and its subsidiaries continue to seek to increase margins by introducing value added products and products based on proprietary technologies 
raw materials raw materials used by the company include ethylene  potassium chloride  aluminum  ortho toluidine  bisphenol a  chlorine  phenol  isobutylene  caustic soda  toluene  diphenyl oxide  alumina trihydrate  dimethlyamine  phthalic anhydride  polystyrene  alpha olefins  maleic anhydride  ethanol  phosphorus  sulfuric acid and nitrogen  as well as electricity and natural gas as fuels  most of which are readily available from numerous suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices the company believes are competitive 
the company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves supported by an active leasing program 
the company has supply agreements with the dead sea bromine group of companies 
the contracts essentially cover the bromine requirements for the production of bromine fine chemicals in the thann and port de bouc  france  facilities and provide additional bromine if requested for the company s other bromine needs 
in addition  the company s affiliate  martinswerk gmbh martinswerk  has certain contracts which require martinswerk to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate page albemarle corporation and subsidiaries from its suppliers 
this is expected to continue as the company or its affiliates expect to continue or expand purchases of aluminum trihydrate 
major customers due to the diversity of product lines in which the company competes  no major portion of the company s overall sales or earnings was generated by one customer nor is the company overly reliant on contracts with any one public  private or governmental entity  although loss of one or more major customers could have a substantial financial impact 
a number of the company s customers manufacture products for cyclical industries such as the agricultural  pharmaceutical  automotive  electronics and building and construction industries 
as a result  demand for the products of the company from customers in such industries also is cyclical 
due to the diversity and size of the company s operations  there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings  except for certain agricultural and pharmaceutical products and certain electronics related flame retardants 
in addition  the profitability of sales of certain of the company s products depends on the level of industry growth and our plant capacity utilization 
in zeolites  our volumes and margins were lower in versus due to a new competitor entering the us market 
we addressed some of the impact through cost reductions while seeking opportunities to expand into other applications utilizing these assets

outlook we believe that will be another challenging year for us with business starting rather slowly as world events stabilize and the global economy continues to recover from the malaise that has carried over from many of our customers end uses  most notably in the electronics and the polymers markets  have suffered from a slowdown in consumer demand throughout and into we expect to see market conditions remaining very difficult in the first half of this year and we hope for a pick up in demand in the latter half of energy and raw material costs in declined throughout the year and appear  at this time 
early to have reached a bottom which could allow us favorable cost opportunities in most of our businesses this year 
we have a concern that the strong dollar  especially against the weaker japanese yen  could have a significant negative impact  especially in our flame retardants business where the japanese market is an important one 
we expect that benefits from our martinswerk and chemfirst custom and fine chemicals businesses acquisitions will continue as we build on the successful integration of both operations into our ongoing businesses 
in addition  we expect that an agreement with atofina chemicals  inc atofina in forming an organotin intermediates joint venture  should be completed by the second quarter of our acquisitions and joint ventures provide business diversification and leverage in our current business and technology 
we remain hopeful that we will be successful with additional acquisitions or joint ventures this year 
in polymer chemicals  pricing in flame retardants continues to be a concern as long as we have soft demand and excess supply in the marketplace 
consequently  we expect downward price pressure to continue 
in tetrabrom  one of our large volume flame retardant products  we estimate the industry is currently operating at about of existing capacity  accordingly  we have elected to delay the start up of our tetrabrom joint venture plant in jordan that was initially planned in fourth quarter we believe this is the prudent thing to do given the weakness in demand  however  we have all the equipment for this plant either in jordan or on order  so we have the ability to bring this plant on line in six to nine months if market conditions dictate it s needed 
we are enjoying the diversification benefits from the halogen free flame retardant products added through our martinswerk acquisition and our joint ventures  eg  polymeradditives 
com 
the markets for these mineral flame retardants products are not as closely tied to electronics as is our brominated line 
in our organometallics area  specifically in new catalysts  we are optimistic that we will see growth as the polyolefin producers commercialize new generation products which will utilize our strong technical and manufacturing position in single site activators 
in our base business  we are assessing the impact of a customer s decision to discontinue certain of its products that utilize aluminum alkyls 
overall for polymer chemicals  we believe we have done a good job of coping with the various challenges in using effective business and cost management and in  we will continue our tight control  stay focused on our strategies and keep our customers satisfied 
in fine chemicals  was a very good year  exceeding expectations in many areas 
a portfolio approach to our fine chemicals business helped offset generally negative economic trends

environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to the company s knowledge  it is currently complying with and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
such compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle 
among other environmental requirements  the company is subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  the company s participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled by the company or its predecessor company 
in de minimis prp matters  the company s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  the company s records indicate that unresolved exposures should be immaterial 
the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs

there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess of amounts already recorded could be up to million before income taxes 
however  the company believes that most of the amount it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects for the company  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects are likely to be more than current year expenditures 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of uncertain market conditions  and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 
the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize their impact on earnings of future periods

when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods
