item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations several of the company s businesses can experience variations in quarterly performance 
as a result  the company s performance in any quarter is not necessarily reflective of full year or longer term trends 
playboy magazine newsstand revenues vary from issue to issue  with revenues generally higher for holiday issues and any issues including editorial or pictorial features that generate unusual public interest 
advertising revenues also vary from quarter to quarter  depending on economic conditions  product introductions by advertising customers and changes in advertising buying patterns 
e commerce revenues are typically impacted by the holiday buying season and decreased internet traffic during the summer months 
additionally  international tv revenues vary due to the timing of recognizing library license fees from ptvi 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following are some of the more complex and critical areas 
ptvi revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from ptvi for the license of the exclusive international tv rights for the use of the playboy tradename  film and video library  and for the acquisition of the international rights to the spice film library  the uk and japan playboy tv networks and certain international distribution contracts 
ptvi is obligated to make total payments of million to the company related to the above over six years  of which million has been received through the end of the remaining payments are owed over the next three years as follows million  million and million 
as the collectibility of these payments is not reasonably assured  the company recognizes these revenues as the consideration is paid to the company  less the company s intercompany interest in such transactions 
this results in significant volatility in the company s results of operations and cash flows from year to year

trademarks the company s trademarks are critical to the success and potential future growth of all of the company s businesses

as such  the company incurs certain costs for acquisition  defense  registration and or renewal of its trademarks 
trademark acquisition costs are capitalized and have been amortized using the straight line method over years 
trademark defense  registration and or renewal costs are capitalized and have been amortized using the straight line method over years 
beginning in  all trademark related costs which have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with new accounting standards
