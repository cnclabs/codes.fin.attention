item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the business of famous dave s of america  inc is to develop  operate and or franchise casual dining restaurants under the name famous dave s 
as of december   there are famous dave s restaurants thirty seven are company owned and operated  and nineteen are franchised 
the locations are summarized in the table below company owned franchised total state restaurants restaurants restaurants alabama georgia illinois indiana iowa maryland minnesota nebraska ohio south dakota tennessee utah virginia wisconsin our future additional revenues and profits will depend upon various factors  including additional market acceptance of the famous dave s concept  the quality of the restaurant operations  the ability to successfully expand into new markets  our ability to raise additional financing as required and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance we will successfully implement our expansion plans  in which case we will continue to be dependent on revenues from existing operations 
we also face all of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the development of an expanding business 
furthermore  to the extent that our expansion strategy is successful  we must manage the transition to multiple site and higher volume operations  the control of overhead expenses and the addition and retention of necessary personnel 
components of operating expenses include food and beverage costs  operating payroll and employee benefits  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  and advertising and promotion 
certain of these costs are variable and will increase with sales volume 
the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management and occupancy costs 
our experience is that when a new restaurant opens  it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize  usually during the first three months of operation 
as restaurant management and staff gain experience following the opening  labor scheduling  food cost management and operating expense control are improved to levels similar to those at our more established restaurants 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that serve to support existing operations and provide an infrastructure to support future growth 
management  supervisory and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  rent  depreciation  general insurance and marketing expenses are major items in this category 
as of january   we elected a or week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest december before january   we used a fiscal year ending on december fiscal years  and were all week years 
we were formed in march and opened our first restaurant in minneapolis in june as of december   we operated a total of thirty seven restaurants and franchised nineteen locations

this increase is due to additional restaurant openings  increased same store sales  increased franchising and royalty revenues 
each of these components is further discussed below 
restaurant revenues restaurant revenue increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was due primarily to an additional six restaurants opened during fiscal  adding to the base of thirty three restaurants open as of december  approximately million of the increase  the contribution of a full year of revenue from restaurants which were open for only part of approximately million of the increase and an increase in revenue from restaurants open for all of both periods approximately million 
the revenue increase was offset by the decline in revenue from two existing restaurants  one which was contributed to an unconsolidated affiliate  the other which was franchised in fiscal approximately million  by the sales of our ribfest and retail units approximately million  and by the sale of two restaurant units during fiscal approximately 
million 
because of the fiscal restaurant openings  and expected additional restaurant openings in  we anticipate revenue and operating costs and expenses to continue to increase during fiscal during fiscal  we increased menu prices an average of 
other revenue other revenue for the company consists of royalty revenues  franchise fees and initial franchise fees 
franchise revenues for fiscal were  a increase when compared to  for the same period in franchise revenue includes both franchise royalty income and initial franchise fees 
royalties are based on a percent of sales  while fee amounts reflect initial non refundable fixed fees and are recorded as revenue when an agreement is signed and no additional material services are required by the company 
the company had nineteen franchises open at december   compared to nine for december  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company sold its sauce and seasoning retail line of business and now receives licensing royalty income 
for fiscal year  the licensing royalty income was  compared to  for the same period in same store sales it is our policy to include in our same store sales base restaurants that have been open more than eighteen months 
at the end of fiscal  there were twenty seven restaurants included in this base 
same store sales for fiscal increased approximately  compared to fiscal s increase of approximately 
management believes that the increase in comparable sales is a result of continued improvements in customer satisfaction and favorable economic trends 
average weekly sales average weekly volume for all of our restaurants was  restaurants opened in the last two fiscal years averaged weekly sales in of  while those opened in or prior averaged weekly sales in of 
restaurant operating weeks during fiscal totaled  compared to  in fiscal the increase in average weekly volume is due to the increase in comparable restaurant sales combined with the successful opening of new  higher volume restaurants

labor and benefits labor and benefits were  or of restaurant revenue in fiscal compared to  or of restaurant revenue in fiscal the increase in labor and benefits in dollar amount was primarily attributable to the opening of six new restaurants with full service as well as a heightened emphasis on training and execution in our restaurants 
the decrease in labor and benefits as a percentage of restaurant revenue is primarily due to increased efficiencies in scheduling and managing labor hours  offset by increases in benefits costs 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to foodservers 
the migration toward full service dining in most of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but does result in higher labor costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were  or of restaurant revenue  compared to  or of restaurant revenue for fiscal the dollar increase in operating expenses is related to the increased number of restaurants 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of restaurant revenue in fiscal  compared to fiscal  is primarily due to continued emphasis placed on cost reduction efforts as well as the impact of fixed costs against a higher average volume  offset by sharp increases in utility costs during the first quarter of depreciation and amortization unit level depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  or of restaurant revenue  compared to  or of restaurant revenue for fiscal total company depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue in fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization  both at the unit level and for the total company  as a percent of revenue is due primarily to increased revenue from both new and existing restaurants in fiscal the increased dollar amount of depreciation expense is the result of construction costs of new units opened in fiscal and a full year s depreciation from locations open only part of fiscal income from unit level operations income from unit level operations in fiscal totaled  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for fiscal income from unit level operations represents income from operations before general and administrative expenses 
although income from unit level operations should not be considered an alternative to income loss from operations as a measure of our operating performance  such unit level measurement is commonly used as an additional measure of operating performance in the restaurant industry and certain related industries 
the change in income from unit level operations from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue both from existing units and additional units opened and an increase in royalty income and franchise fees 
other changes in costs and expenses discussed above also contributed to the change in income from unit level operations

the decrease in expense from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to additional interest income received via notes receivable the company holds with franchisees  as well as a decrease in interest expense on our variable rate line of credit 
this was offset slightly by the increase in interest expense due to increased borrowings

quarterly fluctuations  seasonality and inflation our restaurants typically generate higher revenues in the second and third quarters and lower revenues in the first and fourth quarters as a result of seasonal traffic increases experienced during the summer months  and possible adverse weather which can disrupt customer and employee transportation to our restaurants 
the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations include food and beverage and labor costs 
in addition  our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs and utilities and these costs are subject to inflationary increases

we believe low inflation rates have contributed to relatively stable costs 
there is no assurance  however  that low inflation rates will continue
