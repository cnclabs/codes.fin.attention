item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  apache turned in another record year on many operational and financial fronts  the result of our strategy of pursuing growth through a combination of drilling and acquisition activities in core areas worldwide 
the results were achieved in a year marked with turmoil in the economy  financial markets and the energy industry 
in january  natural gas prices neared per thousand cubic feet mcf  only to fall below per mcf in october 
although commodity prices weakened through the year  apache s rising production profile fueled record income attributable to common stock and record cash from operating activities of million and billion  respectively 
throughout the year  we remained focused on increasing our production and building our reserves at reasonable costs 
our production grew for the th consecutive year  rising percent  to  barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d  the largest year over year percentage increase in a decade 
our fourth quarter average daily production exceeded  boe d  pointing to a strong start for our strategy put in place over a decade ago to seek opportunities outside the us  is paying off for shareholders  for the first time in our history  over half of our equivalent production came from outside the us  adding to the company s stability 
additionally  our record reserves increased for the th consecutive year by percent to billion boe 
production and reserve growth was driven by successful drilling activities in canada and australia  and strategic acquisitions in canada and egypt 
development activities at the ladyfern field in canada  which was discovered on acreage acquired from shell canada in  contributed percent of the company wide increase in gas production 
in australia  drilling and development activity at the legendre  gipsy north gipsy and simpson fields accounted for approximately one third of our worldwide oil production increase 
worldwide  we spent approximately billion on exploration and development and completed over billion of acquisitions 
our acquisitions were dominated by two transactions  the acquisition of the fletcher challenge energy properties  primarily located in canada  and the acquisition of substantially all of repsol ypf s concession interests in egypt 
including the related goodwill  our acquisition cost totaled per boe in all told  apache spent approximately billion on acquisitions  exploration and development  replacing percent of production at a competitive all in finding and acquisition cost of per boe  the outcome of our long term strategy to take a disciplined approach to controlling costs and growing through the most cost effective method given market conditions 
both acquisitions and drilling are important  a barrel is a barrel no matter how you obtain it 
what matters are its underlying economics 
our strategy is also reflected in our balance sheet  which remained strong despite a record year of spending 
we exited the year with debt including preferred interests of subsidiaries and net of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at percent of total capitalization  even with year end we also maintained a senior unsecured long term debt rating of a from moody s  and a from the standard and poor s and fitch rating agencies 
in september  to recognize apache s transformation to a stronger  more profitable company  we declared a percent common stock dividend paid on january   to shareholders of record on december  in conjunction with our stock dividend  we increased our quarterly dividend from six cents per common share to cents per share 
together  these actions are expected to result in a percent increase in the dividends you will receive 
all of the share and per share information included in this discussion have been adjusted for the stock dividend 
results of operations acquisitions and divestitures in each of the past three years  apache has made significant acquisitions that affect the comparability of our financial results 
we acquired  and million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe of proved reserves for approximately  and billion during   and  respectively 
in addition  the acquisitions added million of goodwill and million of production  processing and transportation facilities in  and million of such facilities in these acquisitions helped strengthen our position in our core areas and provided promising prospects for future exploration and development activities 
we will continue our strategy of finding additional reserves on the acquired properties and accelerating the production of those already identified 
in connection with some of these acquisitions  we entered into and assumed fixed price commodity swaps and costless collars that protected apache from falling commodity prices 
this enabled us to better predict the financial implications of our acquisitions 
these  as well as the gas price swaps associated with advances from gas purchasers  increased the company s average natural gas price by 
per mcf during and 
per mcf during they reduced our average crude oil price by 
per bbl during and per bbl during driven by the uncertainty of how the collapse of enron corp 
would impact the derivatives markets  we closed all of these positions in october and november  and recognized a net gain of million 
an additional million net gain will be recognized over the next two years as the original hedged production occurs 
we continuously evaluate our portfolio of properties and divest those that are marginal or do not strategically fit into our growth program 
we divested  and million of properties during   and  respectively 
revenues our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on the prices we receive for our production 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while economic factors such as the current us recession could impact demand 
the table below presents oil and gas production revenues  production and average prices received from sales of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids 
for the year ended december  revenues in thousands natural gas    oil    natural gas liquids    total    natural gas volume mcf per day united states    canada    egypt    australia    other international  total    average natural gas price per mcf united states canada egypt australia other international total oil volume barrels per day united states    canada    egypt    australia    other international total    average oil price per barrel united states canada egypt australia other international total ngl volume barrels per day united states    canada   total    average ngl price per barrel united states canada total natural gas revenues a percent increase in our natural gas production contributed million to our revenues 
canada s increase was primarily driven by our acquisition of producing properties from phillips petroleum company phillips december and fletcher march as well as strong exploration and development results from the ladyfern area 
a full year of production from the properties we acquired from occidental petroleum corporation occidental august and collins ware  inc collins ware june helped to boost our domestic production by percent  while properties acquired from repsol helped double our egyptian production 
during  our natural gas revenues more than doubled 
about percent of this increase was the result of significantly higher natural gas prices 
recognizing the opportunities that these strong natural gas prices provided  we acquired numerous properties at reasonable prices and accelerated our drilling program 
together  these helped increase our production by percent 
properties acquired from a subsidiary of repsol january  collins ware june and occidental august enabled us to increase our domestic production by percent 
increased developmental activities on the properties acquired from shell canada limited shell canada november added percent to our canadian production 
the completion of a second pipeline in australia helped us tap our existing capacity and increase production by percent in similarly  egyptian gas production nearly tripled in reflecting a full year of deliveries into the northern portion of the western desert gas pipeline 
we have used long term  fixed price physical contracts to lock in a portion of our domestic future natural gas production at fixed prices 
these contracts represented approximately and percent of our and domestic natural gas production  respectively 
the contracts provide protection to the company in the event of decreasing natural gas prices 
the historically high prices for natural gas during and  however  resulted in losses under these contracts  negatively impacting our average realized prices by 
per mcf in and 
per mcf in in addition  due to the availability of long term contracts in australia  substantially all of our australian natural gas production is subject to fixed prices 
crude oil revenues our crude oil revenues increased in despite a percent drop in the average realized price 
this was due to a percent increase in our crude oil production 
with the acquisition and subsequent exploitation of properties acquired from repsol march  we increased our egyptian production by percent 
strong results on properties we acquired from fletcher march and phillips december helped us increase our canadian oil production by percent 
we also had success on the drilling front  increasing our australian production by nearly percent with successful development of the legendre  gipsy north gipsy and simpson fields 
our crude oil revenues during nearly doubled  driven by substantially higher oil prices and significant production growth 
during  demand for oil increased  helping boost oil prices by nearly percent 
apache was in prime position to take advantage of this pricing environment 
we increased our overall oil production by percent 
our acquisition of properties from shell offshore inc and affiliated shell entities shell offshore may  collins ware june  and occidental august helped drive domestic oil production up percent 
the acquisition of properties from shell canada november significantly expanded our position in canada and was a major factor in the percent increase in production in that country 
successful drilling in the stag field enabled us to increase our australian production by percent 
our egyptian oil production decreased percent as a result of the price driven dynamics of certain production sharing contracts 
operating expenses the table below presents a detail of our expenses 
year ended december  in millions depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a oil and gas property and equipment other assets international impairments lease operating costs loe severance and other taxes general and administrative expense g a financing costs  net total   depreciation  depletion and amortization apache s full cost dd a expense is driven by many factors including certain costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of producing reserves  production levels  and estimates of proved reserve quantities and future developmental costs 
during  our dd a per boe increased by 
to 
this was primarily the result of higher drilling and finding costs and negative reserve revisions associated with declining prices 
during  full cost dd a expense increased by 
to per boe due primarily to the cost of oil producing properties acquired from occidental per boe 
depreciation on other assets increased million in due to additional facilities acquired from fletcher march and repsol march and the amortization of goodwill 
in connection with the adoption of a new accounting principle effective january   we will no longer amortize our goodwill 
instead  it will be assessed for periodic impairment  as discussed in the impairment section below 
impairments we periodically assess all of our unproved properties for possible impairment 
when an impairment occurs  costs associated with these properties are generally transferred to our proved property base where they become subject to amortization 
in some of our international exploration plays  however  we have not yet established proved reserves 
as such  any impairments in these areas are immediately charged to earnings 
during  we impaired a portion of our unproved property costs in poland and china by million million after tax 
we are continuing to evaluate our operations in poland  which may result in additional impairments in as discussed in note of item of this form k  beginning in  goodwill will be subject to a periodic fair value based impairment assessment 
the company has not yet determined whether or the extent to which the impairment test will affect the consolidated financial statements 
lease operating costs lease operating costs are driven in part by the type of commodity produced and the level of workovers performed 
oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas 
workovers continue to be an important part of our strategy 
they enable us to exploit our existing reserves by accelerating production and taking advantage of high pricing environments  such as the one we had during the first half of during  these costs were per boe  a 
increase from the increase was primarily driven by three factors 
first  our acquisition of canadian and offshore gulf of mexico oil properties carry higher production costs than our other operations 
second  although high commodity prices are beneficial to us overall  they can drive up some of our production costs 
domestically  we had to pay more for service  power and lease fuel costs than we did in finally  workover activity was up in the us and canada 
increases in these two countries were the primary driver of the 
increase in loe per boe in over costs 
severance and other taxes severance and other taxes  which generally are based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  increased in and due to higher oil and gas revenues 
also contributing to the increases were higher effective production tax rates resulting from a loss of available incentives in oklahoma due to higher commodity prices and an increase in canadian large corporation tax from the added production of the properties acquired from fletcher march 
administrative  selling and other expenses g a is influenced by the size of our business 
as a result of our active acquisition program  especially in canada  g a increased during and on an equivalent barrel basis  however  expensed g a fell percent during to 
this was the result of a significant increase in our production while controlling our costs 
during  g a per boe increased percent to 
this was primarily the result of higher incentive compensation driven by apache s then record performance 
financing costs  net net financing costs increased by percent in and percent in due to higher average outstanding borrowings resulting from increased capital expenditures and acquisitions 
at year end  approximately percent of our borrowings were subject to fluctuations in short term rates 
as a result of the decline in these rates  our weighted average cost of borrowing decreased to percent in from percent in oil and gas capital expenditures year ended december  in thousands exploration and development united states    canada    egypt    australia    other international    capitalized interest    total    acquisitions oil and gas properties    gas gathering  transmission and processing facilities    goodwill  apache s acquisition and drilling program added mmboe of proved reserves including revisions and replaced percent of production 
the capital expenditure budget for is approximately million excluding acquisitions  including million for north america 
preliminary north american exploration and development expenditures include million in the southern region  million in the midcontinent region  million in the offshore region and million in canada 
the company has estimated its other international exploration and development expenditures in  exclusive of facilities  to total approximately million 
capital expenditures will be reviewed and possibly adjusted throughout the year in light of changing industry conditions 
cash dividend payments apache paid a total of million in dividends during on its series b preferred stock issued in august and its series c preferred stock issued in may dividends on the series c preferred stock will be paid through may   when the shares will automatically convert to common stock see note under item below 
common dividends paid during totaled million  up five percent from  due to increased common shares outstanding 
the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive years through future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
the company has increased its annual common stock dividend to 
per share beginning in capital resources apache s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
the company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows 
apache budgets capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows 
the company routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and cash flow 
the company cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices 
net cash provided by operating activities apache s net cash provided by operating activities during totaled billion  an increase of percent over the billion in this increase was due primarily to higher oil and gas production revenue as a result of full year production from property acquisitions and properties acquired in net cash provided by operating activities during increased million from due primarily to higher oil and gas production and prices in debt at december   apache had outstanding debt of million under its credit and commercial paper facilities and a total of billion of other debt 
this other debt included notes and debentures maturing in the years through the percent notes totaling million mature on june  these notes and the outstanding debt under credit and commercial paper facilities are classified as long term debt because the company has the ability and intent to refinance them on a long term basis through rollover of commercial paper or availability under the us portion of the global credit facility and day revolving credit facility 
the global credit facility is scheduled to mature in june the company is planning to negotiate new credit facilities in the first half of the company s debt  including preferred interests of subsidiaries and net of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  was percent of total capitalization at december  and based on our current plan for capital spending and projections of debt and interest rates  interest payments on the company s debt for are projected to be million using weighted average balances for floating rate obligations 
apache has a million  day revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
the terms of this facility are substantially the same as those of apache s global credit facility 
the day credit facility will be used  along with the us portion of the global credit facility  to support apache s commercial paper program  which was increased from million to billion in late july refer to note under item of this form k for discussion of our debt instruments and related covenants 
preferred interests of subsidiaries during  several of our subsidiaries issued a total of million million  net of issuance costs of preferred stock and limited partner interests to unrelated institutional investors  adding to the company s financial liquidity 
we pay a weighted average return to the investors of basis points above the prevailing libor interest rate 
these subsidiaries are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements with the million reflected as preferred interests of subsidiaries on the balance sheet 
stock transactions on september   the company s board of directors declared a percent stock dividend  which was paid on january   to shareholders of record on december  no fractional shares were issued and cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares 
in connection with the declaration of this stock dividend  a reclassification was made to transfer million from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
during  the company repurchased  shares of common stock to be held in treasury at an average price of per share 
on august   the company completed the public offering of million shares of apache common stock  including million shares for the underwriters over allotment option  at per share and total net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the acquisitions made during and repay indebtedness under apache s commercial paper program 
in the first quarter of  the company bought back  depository shares  each representing one fiftieth of a share of series c preferred stock  at an average price of per share 
the excess of the purchase price to reacquire the depository shares over the original issuance price is reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations 
liquidity the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   slightly down from million at december  apache s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from at december   to at december  the company had million in short term securities us government agency notes at december   a portion of which is currently available to fund operating and exploration activities  and will be available to reduce long term debt after august  apache believes that cash on hand  net cash generated from operations  short term investments  and unused committed borrowing capacity under its global credit facility and day credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the company s financial obligations to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
as of december   apache s available borrowing capacity under its global credit facility and day revolving credit facility was million 
the company s contractual obligations relate primarily to long term debt  preferred interests of subsidiaries  operating leases  pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  refer to the indicated footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further information regarding these obligations 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operations

the company currently includes such costs in the amortizable base of its oil and gas properties 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january   the company will record a liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation  which will be capitalized as part of the oil and gas properties carrying amount 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for further discussion 
our liquidity could be impacted by a downgrade of the credit rating for our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s to bbb or lower and by moody s to baa or lower  however  we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely 
if our debt were to receive such a downgrade  our subsidiaries that issued the preferred interests described in note to the accompanying financial statements could be in violation of their covenants which may require them to redeem some of the preferred interests as described in that note 
future trends apache s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves exploiting our existing asset base  acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value  and investing in high potential exploration prospects 
in order to maximize financial flexibility during a period of highly volatile natural gas prices coupled with a faltering us economy  apache s present plans are to reduce worldwide capital expenditures for exploratory and development drilling to approximately million from billion in any excess cash flow will be used to reduce debt until such time that we elect either to increase drilling expenditures should the commodity price environment improve  or to pursue acquisition opportunities should they become available at reasonable prices 
exploiting existing asset base apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while reducing operating costs per unit 
in order to achieve these objectives  we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers  recompletions and moderate risk drilling  while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and identifying other activities to reduce costs 
given the significant acquisitions completed over the last two years  apache s inventory of exploitation opportunities has never been larger 
acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers 
our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement  property consolidation and cash flow acceleration  facilitating asset growth and debt reduction 
recently exorbitant acquisition prices have caused apache to sideline its acquisition activities until appropriate opportunities arise at reasonable prices 
investing in high potential exploration prospects apache seeks to concentrate our exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions 
we believe that these investments  although higher risk  offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions 
our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy 
they complement our north american operations  which are more development oriented 
a critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility 
rating upgrades on apache s senior unsecured long term debt received from moody s and standard poor s illustrate our commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet and building a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its united states and canadian natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during average gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
based on the company s worldwide oil production levels  a per barrel change in the weighted average price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by million 
based on the company s worldwide gas production levels  a 
per mcf change in the weighted average price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by million 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission sec 
under these rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes  do not exceed the ceiling 
this ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  net of related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to additional dd a expense 
the calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under long term contracts 
write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities 
the company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as indicated in note under item below  the company terminated all of its derivative instruments in october and november apache sells all of its egyptian crude oil and natural gas to the egpc for us dollars 
deteriorating economic conditions during in egypt have lessened the availability of us dollars resulting in a gradual decline in timeliness of receipts from egpc 
interest rate risk the company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately percent of the company s debt 
at december   total debt included million of floating rate debt 
as a result  apache s annual interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately percent of its total debt outstanding at december  additionally  our preferred interests of subsidiaries of million is subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a percent change in the floating interest rate  including our preferred interests in subsidiaries  approximately basis points would be approximately million 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  or foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
australian gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in australian dollars 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
reported cash flow from canadian operations is measured in canadian dollars and converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates for the period reported 
a portion of apache s debt in canada is denominated in us dollars and  as such  is adjusted for differences in exchange rates at each period end 
this unrealized adjustment is recorded as other revenues losses 
substantially all of the company s international transactions  outside of canada and australia  are denominated in us dollars 
a percent weakening of each of the canadian dollar  polish zloty or australian dollar will result in a foreign currency loss of approximately million 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december  or forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
