item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and and financial conditions as of march  and the comparison of the results with as well as the comparison of the results with were affected by the sale of discontinued operations and embezzlement recovery activities 
results of operations and related notes there to have been adjusted for discontinued operations 
as a result of our discontinuation of the operational outsourcing business  we operate in a single business segment  whereby we provide information technology services and solutions for commercial and government activities 
these services include seat management  enterprise maintenance solutions  network security solutions ebusiness egovernment development and communication services

revenues declined principally in product delivery due to lengthening sales cycles relating to a general market slowdown in hardware orders 
the reduction in hardware related revenue of approximately million was partially offset by increases in services revenue of million 
we experienced increases in professional services and long term fixed price service contracts 
the expansion into new markets brought about by an increase in service contracts has increased the footprint of halifax to include all states and has expanded our services delivery capabilities to seven days a week twenty four hours a day 
revenues include the sale of product  consisting primarily of hardware and software  professional services  enterprise maintenance solutions and seat management services 
services revenue include monthly recurring fixed price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized when earned 
the revenue and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
product sales were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
cost of services operating costs and expenses includes the cost of product  the direct costs  and selling expenses  including fringe benefits  physical plant and other costs 
cost of product was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the largest components of these costs is product cost 
product cost is highly variable and is dependent on two factors 
first  for product sales the cost of product varies directly with the increase or decrease in sales volume 
second  on long term fixed price contracts  product costs vary depending upon the call volume received from customers during the period 
higher call volume typically would result in higher cost of services 
cost of services for the year ended march  were million a decrease of million  or compared with the decrease in cost of services was directly related to the decrease in hardware sales volume discussed above 
a large part of our support costs and expenses includes direct labor and infrastructure costs for our service offerings 
the reductions in cost related to product sales of approximately million are offset by increased costs of million in providing services on the long term recurring contracts 
as a result  we experienced improvements in gross margin increasing from million during the year ended march  to million in  an increase of 
the improvement in gross margin was attributable to the favorable change in sales mix to higher margin long term services contracts and to continued cost containment policies 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended march  as compared to fiscal year the increase of approximately thousand or is a result of several factors 
during the year ended march  we created a company wide marketing group 
the marketing group was created to facilitate a nationwide sales campaign 
in doing so we refined and redirected our sales force and strategy  focusing our direct sales efforts on specific targeted accounts and growing our base of strategic partners to strengthen our indirect sales channels  which has resulted in growth in higher margin service revenues 
marketing expense for the year ended march  was thousand  which accounted for over two thirds of the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses over the prior year 
the remaining increase in costs for marketing  general and administrative expense is attributable to higher professional fees  consulting services and increases in business insurance brought about by general market conditions 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended march  were thousand compared to thousand in the decrease of depreciation and amortization was a result of an increase in fully depreciated assets and a decrease in capital expenditures as compared to prior year 
operating income for the year ended march   we had operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million over the same period last year 
as discussed above the principal reasons for the improved performance were changes in revenue mix to higher margin longer term service contracts  the positive effect of on going cost containment measures  and as a result  lower operating costs 
interest expense interest expense consisted primarily of interest on long term debt 
interest expense for the year ended march  was thousand compared to thousand in the primary reason for lower expense was the significant reduction in interest rates during the year as a result of the general decline in market rates 
non operational items during the year ended march   we had no embezzlement recovery activity compared to a recovery of million for the year ended march  during the year ended march  halifax sold its operational outsourcing division  and accordingly  recorded income from discontinued operations and a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of thousand and million  respectively 
income taxes we provided for a provision for income tax expense of thousand for fiscal compared to thousand in income taxes are primarily related to state tax obligations 
our company has a net operating tax loss carryforward of approximately million which expires through and is available to substantially reduce its income tax expense for future periods 
net income for the year ended march   net income was thousand or 
per share  compared to million or 
for the year ended march  the net income in was generated by embezzlement recoveries and the sale of the operational outsourcing division 
excluding these events from  we would have reported a loss of million during for the year ended march  compared to march  revenue for the year ended march   total revenue decreased to million as compared to million  for fiscal year a decrease of million 
the decrease was due to reductions in product sales and service orders caused by lengthening purchase decrease cycles related to the general slow down in the economy 
cost of services cost of services for the fiscal year ended march  decreased from which was in proportion to the decrease in hardware and services revenue discussed above 
a large part of cost of services includes direct labor and infrastructure costs which were semi fixed in nature and included a charge for inventory obsolescence in fiscal year of thousand due to uncertainties in the market place 
gross margins for fiscal year  gross margins decreased thousand or to million compared to million in march  the reduction in product sales  lower margins due to increased competition  longer selling cycles and excess capacity were the principal reasons for the decline in gross margins 
general and administrative expenses during the year ended march  general and administrative expenses increased or thousand over fiscal the increase in costs is attributable to increases in professional fees  business insurance costs and upgrade and consolidation of our accounting systems 
operating income we incurred an operating loss of million during the fiscal year ended march  due primarily to the reductions in revenue  lower margins and the increase in general and administrative expenses as discussed above 
for the year ended march   halifax had operating income of thousand 
interest and other income or expense interest expense declined thousand or to thousand during the year ended march  compared to principally due to reduced borrowing and lower interest rates 
other expense of thousand in resulted from the disposition of certain obsolete fixed assets 
embezzlement recovery during the years ended march   net embezzlement recoveries were million  net of recovery costs of million  compared to million net recovery costs of thousand  during the year ended march  
income taxes at march   we recorded a provision for income tax of thousand which was primarily for minimum state taxes 
at march   we provided thousand for income tax expense 
we had remaining net operating loss carryforwards amounting to approximately million at march  discontinued operations the net of tax results for discontinued operations for was thousand compared to thousand for the decrease in net income from discontinued operations in fiscal year was due to the shortened period of operations as a result of the disposition on may  we recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of million net of income tax of thousand during fiscal year net income loss from continuing operations the net loss of thousand from continuing operations was due primarily to higher operating expenses offset by embezzlement recoveries of million 
the net income from operations of million was principally the result of embezzlement recoveries of million 
net income for the year ended march   net income decreased million to million  a decrease of 
the major components that comprised the decrease were lower margins on sales of product and services  higher general and administrative expenses  lower embezzlement recoveries offset by income from and the gain on sale of discontinued operations 
net income for the year ended march  was million  with million of income related to embezzlement recoveries and thousand related to discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions  terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our business and effectively manage expenses 
we must continue to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management must also continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
halifax serves its customer base by providing consulting  integration  networking  maintenance and installation services 
this industry has been characterized by rapid technological advances that have resulted in frequent introduction of new products  product enhancements and aggressive pricing practices  which also impacts pricing of service activities 
our operating results could be adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures  the ability to recruit  train and retain personnel integral to the our operations and the presence of competitors with greater financial and other resources 
also  our operating results could be adversely impacted should our company be unable to achieve the revenue growth necessary to provide profitable operating margins in various operations 
our plan for growth includes intensified marketing efforts  an expanding national sales program  strategic alliances and  where appropriate  acquisitions that expand market share 
there can be no assurances these efforts will be successful  or if successful will be on terms advantageous to us 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash balance at march working capital at march net cash used provided by operations before impact of embezzlement net cash recovered related to embezzlement net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investment activities net cash provided used in by financing activities at march   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of 
the increase in working capital is attributable to net earnings and increases in long term debt 
at march   we had negative working capital of thousand and a current ratio of 
the reduction in working capital was attributable to the loss from operations and significant curtailment of long term debt 
working capital was provided from the sale of the operational outsourcing division  embezzlement recoveries and bank borrowings 
a summary of future minimum lease payments is in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in were thousand  compared to thousand in a substantial reduction from prior years 
we anticipate fiscal year technology requirements to result in greater capital expenditures of approximately thousand 
our company continues to sublease a portion of its headquarters building generating approximately thousand annually 
on march   we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with an million maximum credit line 
the loan has a term of months maturing on april  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
advances under the revolving agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets as defined in the agreement 
amounts available under this agreement are determined by applying stated percentages to the eligible receivables 
the agreement has one financial covenant that requires the stockholders deficit not increase above million 
at march   our stockholders deficit was million 
our recent results have shown increased profitability on contracts due to a combination of efficiencies gained in the change of mix in our business to more services as well as reduced cost achieved through containment measures including reducing occupancy cost  consolidation of administrative functions  reduced staffing and higher utilization of our workforce 
our company believes that these recent profitable trends will continue  thereby allowing us to meet the financial covenant 
however  there can be no assurance we will continue to meet this covenant 
should stockholders deficit rise above million  we would work with the bank to arrive at a temporary equitable solution 
on march   the maximum amount of the loan was increased to million and on april  the maximum amount of the loan was increased to million 
the increase of million is for a period of six months 
effective october  the maximum amount of the loan will return to million 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit at march  were million 
the extensions on the line of credit were to assure that we would have sufficient cash available for start up costs related to new contracts or contract modifications and were not necessary to meet our current cash flow needs 
the nature of our business requires us to invest a significant amount of cash upfront that will later be billed to our customers 
we do not anticipate requiring the additional funds available beyond the extension period  but rather wanted the assurance that we have the capacity to actively pursue new contracts and effectively serve our existing customers 
if our customer base were to remain constant  we expect to have approximately million available on our revolving line of credit through october  based on our forecasted projections 
if we were to obtain a significant new contract or contract modification  our availability may be less as we are generally required to invest significant cash upfront that will later be billed to customers 
in november  when our revolving line of credit returns to its original maximum amount of million  we project however  that there will be sufficient availability on the line to fund operations based upon improved cash receipts from contract billing and continued forecasted revenue growth and earnings increases 
our working capital is projected to increase steadily throughout fiscal year on december   we entered into a revolving credit agreement with an million maximum credit line 
amounts available under this agreement are determined by applying stated percentages to our company s eligible and unbilled receivables 
as of march   we had an outstanding balance of million with an additional million available on the line of credit 
the loan was paid in full on march  the revolving credit agreements prohibit the payment of dividends or distributions as well as limit the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt 
interest expense on subordinated debt is accrued on a current basis 
the subordinated debt agreements with an affiliate totaled million at march  and principal repayment and interest payable on the subordinated debt agreements have been extended to april  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   halifax issued  shares of common stock in the amount of thousand in lieu of cash in payment of interest on notes due to research industries through november  the value of the stock was equal to the market price on date of issue 
january   we made a cash payment of thousand to research industries for interest due 
at march  and  interest payable to research industries was thousand and thousand  respectively 
during the year ended march   the company paid thousand to a consultant who is now an officer of the company 
in september  we entered into a note payable arrangement with a major supplier of digital communications switches payable over months with interest at 
the balance of the note due at march  was thousand and was paid in full during fiscal year our company believes that funds generated from operations  bank borrowings  and investing activities should be sufficient to meet its current operating cash requirements through july   although there can be no assurances that all the aforementioned sources of cash can be realized 
the following are our contractual obligations associated with lease commitments  debt obligations and consulting commitments

these notes are each subordinate to the bank line of credit and cannot be paid without the consent of its bank 
the company has a consulting advisory service commitment with a former ceo of the company 
from april  through march   the company is to pay the former ceo thousand per year for consulting services 
application of critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgements we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the security and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as policies that involve critical accounting estimates that require i management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and ii different estimates that could have been reasonably used for the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or in results of operations 
based on this definition our most critical policies include provision for loss contracts  inventory valuation reserve and allowances for doubtful accounts  which impact cost of sales and gross margin  and the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill and intangibles 
we discuss these policies further below  as well as the estimates and management s judgements involved 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as policies for revenue recognition  including unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue  as well as policies governing the estimate of the useful life of our property and equipment 
we believe these policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgements that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period 
we recognize service revenue based on contracted fees earned  net of credits and adjustments as the service is performed 
revenue from long term fixed unit price contracts is recognized monthly as service is performed based upon the number of units covered and the level of service requested 
the pricing in these contracts is fixed as to the unit price but varies based upon the number of units covered and service level requested 
revenue from time and material professional service contracts is recognized upon the completion of the service 
certain seat management contracts include the delivery and installation of new equipment combined with multi year service agreements 
revenue related to the delivery and installation of equipment under theses and certain other contracts is recognized upon the completion of both the delivery and installation 
product sales were million  million and million  with corresponding cost of sales of million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
revenue related to the fixed price service agreements is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenue when earned 
revenues are a function of the mix of long term services contracts and time and material professional services 
revenues from time and material professional services are difficult to forecast because of wide fluctuations in demand 
the long term contracts are more predictable and  as a result  the revenue stream is less difficult to forecast 
the gross margins on long term contracts vary inversely with the call volume received from customers in any one reporting period 
our expectation is that we will see continued growth in long term contracts  which historically have had higher gross margins and continued downward pressure on hardware and software margins 
provision for loss contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
historically  we have had few loss contracts 
the gross margin should benefit from revenue growth and continued cost containment strategies implemented 
our gross margin varies based on the level of long term professional services compared to product volume  including the mix of types of product being sold 
our policy for valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand based on prior usage to support our contracts and anticipated future demand 
if the demand is less than anticipated  we would be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
for the last three years  our inventory reserve has ranged from to of inventory 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can significantly affect net income and treatment of the allowance requires us to anticipate the economic viability of our customers and requires a degree of judgement 
over the past three years bad debts expenses represented approximately 
to of revenue 
the company routinely transfers receivables to a third party in connection with equipment leased to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to the company for the receivables by the transferee is approximately equal to the company s carrying value and therefore the gain recognized is not material 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and the company  for various services provided to the end users 
the company provides limited monthly servicing whereby the company invoices the end user on behalf of the transferee 
we are in the process of adopting financial accounting standards nos 
and on accounting for business combinations and goodwill 
accordingly we will no longer amortize goodwill  but will continue to amortize other acquisitions related costs 
we expect amortization of acquisition related intangibles to be approximately thousand  down from thousand of amortized goodwill and acquisition related intangibles and costs in fiscal year we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual assets lives and our intended use for those assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate these carrying values may not be recoverable 
any changes in these asset lives would be reported in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
there have been no material changes in asset lives during the three years ended march  in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  as of the beginning of fiscal year  we have begun the initial goodwill impairment test required by sfas although it has not yet completed its analysis  the company is not expecting an impairment loss to be recognized upon the adoption of sfas according to our accounting policy under the new rules  we will perform a similar review annually  or earlier if indicators of a potential impairment exists 
our impairment review is based on a market approach that uses valuation ratios for publicly traded companies based on the ratio of market price of their stock and or invested capital to various financial parameters 
halifax has been designated as a single reporting unit for financial reporting purposes 
under this method  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value inclusive of goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value their is no impairment and no further analysis is necessary 
if our revenue and cost forecast may not be achieved  we fail to have continued profitability and market acceptance  or if the market conditions in the stock market cause the valuation to decline  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
we adopted financial accounting standards no 
on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective april  the adoption of this standard did not have any material impact on our financial statements 
we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately for fiscal year this estimate is based upon current tax laws  the current estimate of earnings  and the utilization of our net operating loss carry forward 
our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained herein involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular plans to cultivate new business  the ability to expand our footprint  revenues  pricing  gross margins and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization and potential future impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the factors discussed above  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following business and economic conditions in the areas we serve  possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activities  reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  pricing pressures and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory values 
we believe that we have the service and product offerings  facilities  personnel and competitive resources for continued business success  however future revenues  costs  margins and profits are influenced by a number of factors  including those discussed above  all of which are difficult to forecast 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as result of bank debt to finance its business 
the floating interest debt exposes us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate exposure resulting from changes in the prime rate 
it is assumed in the table below that the prime rate will remain constant in the future 
adverse changes in the interest rates or our inability to refinance our long term obligations may have a material negative impact on our operations 
the definitive extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we do not believe such risk is material 
we do not customarily use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
the information below summarizes halifax s sensitivity to market risks as of march  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity of our funded debt 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains descriptions of our debt and should be read in conjunction with the table below in thousands
