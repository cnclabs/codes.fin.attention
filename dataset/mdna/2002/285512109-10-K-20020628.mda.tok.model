item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements about circumstances that have not yet occurred 
all statements  trend analysis and other information contained below relating to markets  our products and trends in revenue  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe or expect and statements in the future tense are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and actual events or our actual future results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
we will not necessarily update information if any forward looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate 
risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and performance include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the heading risk factors at pages to of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
sales allowances and bad debt reserves we derive revenues from sales of our packaged goods product  subscriptions of online service  sales of packaged goods through our online store and website advertising 
product revenue is recognized net of an allowance for returns 
we also have stock balancing programs for our personal computer products that  under certain circumstances and up to a specified amount  allow for the exchange of personal computer products by resellers 
we may decide to provide price protection under certain circumstances for our personal computer and video game system products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel  the rate of inventory sell through in the channel  and our remaining inventory on hand 
we maintain a policy of exchanging products or giving credits  but do not give cash refunds 
we estimate potential future product returns  price protection and stock balancing programs related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the video game market and the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances 
in addition  management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods 
in the past  actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns in any future period are inherently uncertain as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns for our products on mature platforms may increase as new hardware platforms  such as xbox  nintendo gamecube and playstation  become more popular 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters  if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our returns reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
in addition  if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported revenue 
similarly  management must use significant judgment and make estimates in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
management analyzes customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
if our customers experience financial difficulties and are not able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us  our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
for example  in january  one of our retail customers  kmart  declared bankruptcy 
we have adequately reserved for our exposure to kmart 
our distribution channels have been characterized by change  including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers 
our gross accounts receivable balance was  and our allowance for product returns  pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was  as of march  as of march   our gross accounts receivable balance was  and our allowance for product returns  pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was  prepaid royalties prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing royalties  co publishing and or distribution affiliates and license fees paid to celebrities  professional sports organizations and other organizations for use of their trade name and content 
also included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to independent software developers under development arrangements that have alternative future uses 
prepaid royalties are expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product sales 
we evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly and charge to research and development expense any amounts that we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
we rely on forecasted revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties 
if actual revenues  or revised forecasted sales  fall below the initial forecasted sales  the charge to research and development expense may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter 
once the charge has been taken to research and development expense  that amount will not be expensed in future quarters when the product has shipped 
the current portion of prepaid royalties  included in other current assets  was  at march  and  at march  the long term portion of prepaid royalties  included in other assets  was  at march  and  at march  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets under current accounting standards  we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet 
in order to judge the remaining useful life of an asset  management makes various assumptions about the value of the asset in the future 
this may include assumptions about future prospects for the business that the asset relates to and typically involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these businesses 
please refer to the operations by segment discussion of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussions of ea core and ea 
com 
for our ea core division  our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms 
the success of our products is affected by the ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful 
also  our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
for our ea 
com division  the future net cash flows are dependent on the success of online games 
offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our traditional business of selling packaged software games 
because of our inexperience in predicting usage patterns for our games  we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online 
due to these and other factors described in our risk factors  we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets 
for example  our product majestic tm and our platinum offering  which contained certain browser based entertainment games  were launched with a monthly subscription pricing model and obtained only limited commercial success 
accordingly  we did not realize our projected cash flows and discontinued these offerings as part of ea 
com s restructuring plan 
based on these judgments and assumptions  management determines whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
although we believe the judgments and assumptions management has made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  there is nonetheless a high degree of uncertainty and judgment involved 
for example  as part of a restructuring plan to reduce ea 
com s workforce and consolidate facilities in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded impairment charges to write down certain of ea 
com s depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value and to write off certain assets which were abandoned 
the impairment charges were based on management s projections regarding the assets remaining useful lives and future values 
the ea 
com business is still in the growing stages  therefore evaluating its business and prospects is more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business 
we continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced with launching a new business 
we continue to look for ways to streamline the business by consolidating systems and reducing infrastructure costs 
different judgments and assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses would result in greater impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions would result in smaller impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
impairment charges on long lived assets amounted to  for the fiscal year ended march  there were no impairment charges on long lived assets for the years ended march  and on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
intangible assets 
as a result of adopting this standard  we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles  but will no longer amortize certain other intangible assets  most notably goodwill and acquired workforce  which had a net book value at march  of  amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately  for fiscal  approximately  for fiscal and approximately  for fiscal based on intangible assets as of march   we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately  for fiscal following adoption of sfas  we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable 
in addition  sfas requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can effect the overall effective tax rate 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to revenues we derive revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software  which includes ea studio products for dedicated entertainment systems that we call video game systems or consoles such as playstation  playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube  and handheld systems such as game boy advance  ea studio personal computer products or pc  co publishing products that are co published and distributed by us  and affiliated label or al products that are published by third parties and distributed by us 
we also derive revenues from licensing of ea studio products and al products through hardware companies or oem  selling subscriptions on our online gaming service  selling advertisements on our online web pages and selling our packaged goods through our online store 
information about our net revenues for north america and foreign areas for fiscal and is summarized below in thousands increase change north america    europe    asia pacific    japan    international    consolidated net revenues    north america net revenues the increase in north america net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to 
a increase in playstation revenues for the year due to the shipment of key titles such as madden nfl  james bond in 
agent under fire  nba street  nba live and ssx tricky  a higher installed base of hardware and a strong catalogue business 
playstation launched in october consequently  fiscal includes six months of revenues as compared to twelve months of revenues for the playstation in fiscal 
the launch of the xbox platform in north america in november  which generated  in revenues from titles such as madden nfl  nba live  james bond inagent under fire  nascar thunder  nhl and ssx tricky 

the launch of nintendo gamecube in north america in november  which generated  for the year from key titles such as madden nfl  james bond inagent under fire  ssx tricky  nba street and fifa soccer 
new revenues were generated by game boy advance of  for the year from key titles including harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  madden nfl and nhl also  game boy color generated new revenues of  for the year from titles such as harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  madden nfl and the world is not enough 

advertising revenues increased by  for the twelve months ended march  as we commenced generating advertising revenues immediately following the launch of our gamesite on the world wide web in october in addition  advertising revenues were generated from pogo corporation s pogo websites subsequent to the february acquisition 

these increases were partially offset by the continued expected decreases in sony playstation and nintendo n revenues due to those declining markets and fewer titles shipping compared to the same period in the prior year 
international net revenues the increase in international net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to the following 
europe s net revenues increased by compared to the prior year primarily due to higher playstation  al and pc sales  partially offset by the expected decrease of revenues from sony playstation 
playstation launched in november consequently  fiscal includes five months of revenues as compared to twelve months of revenues from the playstation in fiscal  resulting in an increase in playstation revenues 

asia pacific s net revenues increased by compared to the prior year primarily due to higher playstation  game boy color and pc revenue  partially offset by the expected decrease in playstation and nintendo sales  and an unfavorable exchange rate comparison of approximately 
playstation revenues increased by  partially offset by a decrease in playstation revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
japan s net revenues increased by compared to the prior year primarily due to higher al revenue and revenue generated from sales of playstation  nintendo gamecube and xbox products  offset by the strong sales of our first playstation title  fifa soccer world championship  in the prior year and weakness in the yen currency during fiscal resulting in a rate decrease of approximately from fiscal also  japan did not benefit from our primary playstation releases during the current fiscal year  which have more appeal to the north american market 
playstation revenues decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal information about our worldwide net revenues by product line for fiscal and is presented below in thousands increase decrease change ea studio playstation    pc    playstation    xbox   n a nintendo gamecube   n a game boy advance   n a game boy color   n a advertising    online subscriptions    license  oem and other    n    online packaged goods   affiliated label    consolidated net revenues    playstation product net revenues revenues increased for the twelve months ended march  due to the higher installed base of playstation hardware and more titles  including catalogue  available on the platform compared to the same period last year 
major releases for the fiscal year include titles such as madden nfl  james bond in agent under fire  fifa  nba street  nba live  ncaa football  ssx tricky  nhl and nascar thunder we released playstation titles in the current fiscal year compared to in the same period last year 
we expect revenues from playstation products to continue to grow in fiscal  but as revenues for these products increase  we do not expect to maintain these growth rates 
personal computer product net revenues the increase in sales of pc products for the twelve months ended march  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the continued strong sales of the sims  which shipped over two years ago 
key current year releases were harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  the sims hot date expansion pack  medal of honor allied assault tm  command conquer renegade tm and madden nfl we released pc titles in the twelve months ended march  compared to in the same period last year 
the sims continues to be the number one pc title and has now sold over six million copies 
due to the sales of the sims in fiscal  we expect revenues from pc products to be flat or lower in fiscal playstation product net revenues we released five playstation titles in the twelve months ended march  compared to titles in the same period last year 
as expected  playstation sales decreased for the twelve months ended march  compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the transition to next generation console systems and fewer titles released for the product during the current year 
although our playstation products are playable on the playstation console  we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america in july the sony agreement  as amended  we are authorized to develop and distribute cd based software products compatible with the playstation 
furthermore  under the terms of an additional licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america as of april the playstation agreement  as amended  we are authorized to develop and distribute dvd based software products compatible with the playstation pursuant to these agreements  we engage sony to manufacture its playstation and playstation cds and dvds for us 
accordingly  we have limited ability to control our supply of playstation and playstation cd and dvd products or the timing of their delivery 
xbox net revenues following the launch of the xbox platform in north america in november  we released our first ten xbox titles during fiscal titles released included madden nfl  nba live  james bond in 
agent under fire  nascar thunder  nhl  triple play tm  ssx tricky  knockout kings and f nintendo gamecube net revenues we released our first five nintendo gamecube titles  madden nfl  james bond in

an increase in the number of paying customers for ultima online to  as of march  as compared to  as of march  this increase was primarily due to the continued strong sales of ultima online third dawn and the release of ultima online lord blackthorn s revenge in february in addition  the launch of motor city online in october  which contributed  in subscription revenues for fiscal 
offset by a decrease in subscription revenues of  for gamestorm  kesmai corporation kesmai and worldplay online games most of which were transferred to our free service when the ea aol site went live in october in fiscal as compared to fiscal license  oem and other revenues the increase in license  oem and other revenues for the twelve months ended march  was primarily due to a new oem agreement with a customer in europe and higher revenues in north america 
nintendo product net revenues we released one n title in fiscal compared to three titles during fiscal the expected decrease in n revenues for the fiscal year  compared to the prior fiscal year  was primarily due to the declining market for n products and fewer titles released on this platform in the current fiscal year 
we do not intend to release any new n products in fiscal online packaged goods net revenues online packaged goods revenues for fiscal were slightly higher than fiscal primarily due to the release of motor city online in october affiliated label product net revenues al product sales increased for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong sales of hit titles including devil may cry and resident evil code veronica resulting from new distribution deals with capcom as well as the simpsons tm road rage in the current year 
this was partially offset by lower revenues from shipment of square ea products due to fewer titles released in fiscal compared to fiscal operations by segment management considers ea

amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately  for fiscal and approximately  for fiscal based on intangible assets as of march   we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately  for fiscal following adoption of sfas  we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable 
in addition  sfas requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we are in the process of completing an evaluation for impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas we believe the implementation of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
charge for acquired in process technology of net of net revenues revenues change n a  in connection with the acquisition of pogo in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal  we allocated and expensed  of the  purchase price to acquired in process technology

pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition 
as of the acquisition date  costs to complete pogo projects acquired were expected to be approximately  in future periods 
during fiscal  all of these development projects were completed and launched on pogo gamesites 
in conjunction with the acquisition of pogo  we accrued approximately  related to direct transaction and other related costs 
this charge was made after we concluded that the in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software 
charge for restructuring and impairment of net of net revenues revenues change  n a n m during fiscal  we announced a restructuring plan for ea 
com to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities 
these restructuring and resulting asset impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and reduce ea 
com s operating cost structure 
a pre tax charge of  was recorded in fiscal  consisting of  for workforce reductions   for consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges and  for the write off of non current assets as a direct result of the restructuring 
the pre tax charge of  consisted of  in cash outlays and  in non cash charges related to the write offs of non current assets and facilities 
as of march   an aggregate of  in cash had been paid out under the restructuring plan 
of the remaining cash outlay of   is expected to occur in fiscal while the remaining  related to future lease payments will occur is fiscal years and beyond 
adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon current events and circumstances 
the restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately personnel  or one third of ea 
com s workforce  which affected all departments across the organization 
the estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub lease income 
included in these costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities 
in addition  the restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  to adjust these depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value 
management evaluated the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain ea

this loss will be carried forward to future tax years

the net operating losses for both fiscal and fiscal resulted from losses from ea 
com s operations as well as stock option deductions 
a valuation allowance has not been established on these loss carryforwards or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize them 
net income loss of net of net revenues revenues change   n m in absolute dollars  reported net income loss increased in fiscal primarily related to higher net revenues  partially offset by higher expenses compared to the same period last year 
the increase in expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a higher number of franchise titles

pro forma net income  excluding the items noted above  was  for the fiscal year ended march  and  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in pro forma net income for the fiscal year ended march  was due to higher revenues and gross profits as compared to the same periods last year

apb  intangible assets 
sfas addresses the accounting treatment for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets upon their acquisition  but not acquired in a business combination 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
with the adoption of sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
also  if the benefit of an intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized 
the terms of sfas are effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december  certain provisions of sfas shall be applied to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets for which the acquisition date is after june  on april   we adopted sfas as a result of adopting this standard  we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles  but will no longer amortize certain other intangible assets  most notably goodwill and acquired workforce  which had a net book value at march  of  amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce totaled approximately  for fiscal  approximately  for fiscal and approximately  for fiscal based on intangible assets as of march   we estimate that amortization of finite lived intangibles will total approximately  for fiscal following adoption of sfas  we will continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable 
in addition  sfas requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we are in the process of completing an evaluation for impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas we believe the implementation of sfas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of determining the impact of this new accounting standard 
we believe the implementation of sfas will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors electronic arts business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance 
some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows risk factors relating to our core business new video game platforms create additional technical and business model uncertainties large portions of our revenues are derived from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms such as the sony playstation 
the success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful 
sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than we expected 
conversely  if we do not develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinue development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
for example  the sega dreamcast console launched in japan in early and in the united states in september of we have developed no products for this platform 
had this platform achieved wide market acceptance  our revenue growth would have been adversely affected 
similarly  we are developing products for the xbox and nintendo gamecube 
if these platforms do not achieve wide commercial acceptance  our revenue growth will be adversely impacted 
product development schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia personal computers  or pcs  are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
for example  emperor battle for dune for the pc  which was expected to ship in fiscal was not released until the first quarter of fiscal due to development delays 
also  james bond inagent under fire for the ps  which was expected to ship in fiscal  released in october of fiscal due to development delays 
additionally  development risks for cd rom and dvd products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year 
our business is both seasonal and cyclical our business is highly seasonal with a significant percentage of our revenues occurring in the december quarter 
in fiscal  these seasonal trends were magnified by general industry factors  including the platform transition  the fall launches of the xbox and nintendo gamecube in north america and the economic slowdown in the united states and other territories 
our business is also cyclical  video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  and decline as more advanced platforms are being introduced 
as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging  buying patterns may change 
purchases of products for older platforms may slow at a faster rate than sales of new platforms 
we have been going through a platform transition during the last months and are now well into a new platform cycle 
sony shipped its playstation console in japan in march  in north america in october and in europe in november nintendo launched the nintendo gamecube console in japan in september  north america in november and in europe in may microsoft launched the xbox console in north america in november  in japan in february and in europe in march sales of our products for the n and sony playstation platforms have already been adversely affected  and we expect this trend to continue 
the impact of e commerce and online games on our business is not known while we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales of our packaged products  we believe that such form of distribution will become a more significant factor in our business in the future 
e commerce is becoming an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers 
how that form of distribution will affect the more traditional retail distribution  at which we have historically had success  and over what time period  is uncertain 
in addition  we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and become a significant factor in the interactive games business generally 
we do not know how that increase generally  or the emerging business of ea 
com specifically  will affect the sales of packaged goods 
our business  our products  and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content  consumer privacy and online delivery in key territories legislation is increasingly introduced which may affect the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy rules in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory while of course the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  in response to recent events  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as those made by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products our agreements with hardware licensors  which are also our chief competitors  typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
for example  in prior years  we experienced delays in obtaining approvals for and manufacturing of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors 
such occurrences would harm our business and adversely affect our financial performance 
additionally  we have not negotiated a final publishing agreement with nintendo for the nintendo gamecube platform and although we are currently operating under an understanding with nintendo  we cannot be assured that the final terms of the formal agreement will be favorable 
proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to our business many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies 
additionally  many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games 
several such patents have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
risk factors relating to our online business because of ea 
com s limited operating history  it will be difficult to evaluate its business and prospects ea 
com s business is still in the developing stages  so evaluating its business and prospects will be more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business 
we will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced in launching a new business  and we may not achieve our goals or may be compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the business 
these uncertainties as to the future operations of ea 
com will increase the difficulty we face in completing and pursuing the essential plans for the development of the business and will also make it more difficult for our stockholders and securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business 
ea 
com has a history of losses and expects to continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability ea 
com has incurred substantial losses to date  including the current fiscal year 
we expect ea 
com to continue to incur losses as it builds its business 
ea 
com will be required to maintain the significant support  service and product enhancement demands of online users  and we cannot be certain that ea 
com will produce sufficient revenues from its operations to support these costs 
even if profitability is achieved  ea 
com may not be able to sustain it over a period of time 
our agreements with america online may not prove successful to the development of ea 
com s business we have a series of agreements with america online aol for the offering of our games for online play 
these agreements require that we make substantial guaranteed payments to aol and that we commit our resources to the pursuit of the online game opportunity 
we cannot be assured that the substantial costs associated with the aol agreements will be justified by the revenues generated from that relationship 
in addition  restrictions included in the aol agreements limiting other channels we may develop for offering online games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies 
the success for us of the aol agreements will also be a result of aol s performance under the agreements  a factor over which we will have very little control 
we have limited experience with online games and may not be able to operate this business effectively offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our traditional business of selling packaged software games 
we have employed various revenue models  including subscription fees  pay to play fees and advertising 
we have limited experience with developing optimal pricing strategies for online games 
for example  our product majestic and our platinum offering  which contained certain browser based entertainment games  were launched with a monthly subscription pricing model and obtained only limited commercial success 
accordingly  we did not realize our projected cash flows and discontinued these offerings as part of ea 
com s restructuring plan 
similarly  we have limited experience in predicting usage patterns for our games 
because of our inexperience in this area  we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online 
online games have risks that are not associated with our traditional business online games  particularly multiplayer games  pose risks to player enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged goods games 
players frequently would not be acquainted with other players  which may adversely affect the playing experience 
social issues raised by a player s conduct may impact the experience for other players 
it is difficult to monitor player behavior that impairs the game experience 
in addition  there are substantial technical challenges to be met both in the introduction of our games online and in maintaining an effective game playing environment over time 
also  hacking and spamming has become a serious problem for online sites  and significant hacking and spamming could seriously interfere with online game play 
if these risks are not successfully controlled and technical challenges resolved  potential customers for our games may be unwilling to play in sufficient volume to allow us to attain or sustain profitability 
proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to the business of ea 
com many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used internet technologies 
additionally  many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of older technologies 
several such patents have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
development of ea 
com s business will require significant capital  and we cannot be assured that it will be available ea 
com will not be successful if it does not continue to receive substantial financing that is required to continue to build its business 
electronic arts has agreed to provide a limited amount of funding to ea 
com  but this financing alone may not be sufficient for the development of ea 
com s business 
any additional funding that is obtained from electronic arts may either be treated as a debt arrangement or would increase electronic arts retained interest in ea 
com and correspondingly decrease the interest of the holders of outstanding shares of class b common stock 
the attraction of additional equity or debt financing for ea 
com from third parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms that result in significant dilution to class a and class b common stockholders or incremental interest payments and debt related restrictions on the operation of the business 
to date  nearly all funding except warrants and cash from revenues has been provided by electronic arts 
if use of the internet does not continue to develop and reliably support the demands placed on it by electronic commerce  ea 
com s business will be harmed ea 
com s success depends upon growth in the use of the internet as a medium for playing games 
the use of the internet for sophisticated games like ours is relatively new 
our business would be seriously harmed if 
use of the internet does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected  
the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support online game play  
concerns over the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions  or 
government regulations regarding internet content  privacy or other conditions impede the effectiveness of the internet to users 
capacity restraints may restrict the use of the internet as a forum for game play  resulting in decreased demand for our products the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data 
other risks associated with commercial use of the internet could slow its growth  including 
outages and other delays resulting from the inadequate reliability of the network infrastructure  
slow development of enabling technologies and complementary products  and 
limited availability and adoption by consumers of cost effective  high speed access 
delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or increased governmental regulation  would cause the internet to fail to gain  or lose  viability as a means of game playing 
if these or any other factors cause use of the internet for commerce to slow or decline  the internet may not prove viable as a commercial marketplace 
this  in turn  would result in decreased demand for ea 
com s products and services 
to become and remain competitive  ea 
com must continually develop new content 
this is inherently risky and expensive 
ea 
com s success depends on our ability to develop new products and services for the ea 
com site 
our agreement with aol requires us to develop new games for the ea 
com site 
we cannot assure you that products will be developed on time  in a cost effective manner  or that they will be commercially successful 
currently  the release of several products such as the sims online and earth beyond for which we expect to generate subscription revenue  have been delayed due to longer than anticipated development schedules 
similarly  the online product majestic achieved only limited commercial success due in part to the length of time it took to download the online software component 
accordingly  we discontinued majestic on may  we may not be able to respond to rapid technological change the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
we will be required to continually improve performance  features  reliability and capacity of our network infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding rapidly or in a cost effective manner to such developments 
increasing governmental regulation of the internet could limit the market for our products as internet commerce continues to evolve  we expect that federal  state and foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user privacy  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
it is possible that legislation could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability  taxation or other increased costs  any of which could limit the growth of electronic commerce generally 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws and regulations could limit the market for ea 
com s products 
our revenues have been heavily dependent on a single product and would be adversely affected if that product s popularity were to decline in the near term  ea 
com s subscription revenues to date have consisted primarily of revenues from sales of our online product ultima online  and we would be adversely affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason and not be replaced 
we expect the online game market to become increasingly competitive  and it is possible that competing products could cause revenues from ultima online to decline 
in addition  popularity of ultima online could decline over time simply because of consumer preference for new game experiences 
we continue to invest in research and development and network technology and operations for ea 
com  and we cannot be assured that we will achieve revenues that support this level of spending we have invested heavily  and expect to continue to invest  in research and development and network technology and operations for our website and online games 
while we have reduced the overall level of spending for ea 
com  we will continue to invest in the technologies  tools and network infrastructure that are necessary for us to launch and support our key products  earth beyond and the sims online 
accordingly  there are no assurances that the revenues from these products will exceed the associated costs in order for ea 
com to achieve profitability 
if we cannot increase revenues to profitable levels  the value of ea 
com will be impaired 
in order to develop the broad game offerings that we envision for our online operations it will continue to be necessary to engage in significant developmental efforts both to adapt existing electronic arts games to the online format and to create new online games 
our agreements with aol require us to maintain a substantial commitment to online game development and we cannot be assured that we will realize acceptable returns from this investment 
online product development schedules are unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult online product development schedules  particularly for internet based games are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools  internet latency issues  a learning process to better understand internet based game mechanics  and research and experimentation associated with development for new online technologies 
additionally  development risks for internet based products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because of the challenges associated with game testing  live beta testing  integration into network servers and integration on to the games web site and may impact the release go live dates of products during a particular quarter 
several online products currently under development such as the sims online and earth beyond have experienced development delays and will be released later than planned 
our revenues and operating costs are dependent on our ability to meet our product go live schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues falling short of analysts expectations  resulting in increased operating losses for ea 
com 
we are heavily dependent on a few internet infrastructure service providers to host and manage our servers at co location facilities and our operating results may be adversely affected if we must change service providers we are dependent on a few third party internet infrastructure service providers to host and manage the majority of our servers that support our online games 
the performance of these service providers are outside of our control 
many of the service providers in the internet infrastructure space require substantial financial resources to build  maintain and manage co location facilities 
to the extent that industry  economic  financial or competitive factors influence the level of performance that we expect from service providers we currently use for co location space bandwidth and rack  we may need to re locate our servers to another co location facility which would increase our expenses and may result in delays or reduced shipments of our online products  thereby adversely impact our operating results 
general risk factors because of the competition for qualified technical  creative  marketing and other personnel  we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our businesses the market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel essential to the development of online businesses and management of our online and core businesses continues to be competitive  although current market conditions have made it less difficult to attract and retain the employees we need 
in the last fiscal year  notwithstanding the downturn of the economy generally  competitive recruiting efforts aimed at electronic arts employees and executives continued 
electronic arts leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent to assist in the consolidation that the interactive entertainment industry is experiencing 
in addition  the cost of real estate in the san francisco bay area the location of our headquarters and largest studio remains relatively high  and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 
foreign sales and currency fluctuations for the fiscal years ended march  and  international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate 
while we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot control translation issues 
for example  our japan and asia pacific revenues in fiscal were adversely impacted by a devaluation of the yen and australian dollar as compared to the prior year 
the devaluation had an adverse effect for the year on our net revenues and net income 
any of these factors may significantly harm our business 
increased difficulties in forecasting results during platform transition periods  where the success of our products is significantly impacted by the changing market for our products  forecasting our revenues and earnings is more difficult than in more stable or rising product markets 
the demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than we anticipate  negatively impacting both revenues and earnings 
at launch  sony shipped only half of the number of playstation units to retail in north america than it had originally planned  and it shipped significantly fewer units than planned at launch in europe as well 
shortages were announced as being caused by shortages of components for manufacturing 
due to these shortages  our results of operations for fiscal were adversely affected 
consequently  if microsoft or nintendo do not ship the number of units planned for the xbox and nintendo gamecube  our sales of these products may be adversely affected in fiscal the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting generally accepted accounting principles is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
recent actions and public comments from the sec have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
similarly  congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles 
in addition  the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  some of which represent a significant change from current industry practices 
while we do not anticipate that such proposals will affect the actual conduct of our business and we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we cannot predict the impact of the adoption of any such proposals on our financial statements going forward 
fluctuations in stock price due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock historically has been  and we expect will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  internet  entertainment  media or electronics businesses 
in addition  fluctuations may be due to uncertainties in the securities markets in general 
for example  during the fiscal year ended march   the price per share of our class a common stock ranged from to and to during the fiscal year ended march  world events the terrorist attacks of september  in the unites states  the subsequent us military action  and the continuing concerns over potential additional terrorist attacks against us interests and citizens pose serious uncertainties in our business 
consumer spending  consumer preferences in entertainment  and the securities markets generally may be affected on an ongoing and unpredictable basis by these events  all of which may make prediction of our results more difficult 
because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies  thereby  limiting our risk 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
at march   we had foreign exchange contracts  all with maturities of less than three months to purchase and sell approximately  in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds  european currency units euro  canadian dollars and other currencies 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate 
the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the following table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
weighted average contract contract amount rate fair value in thousands in thousands foreign currency to be sold under contract british pound  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  swedish krona  australian dollar  south african rand  norwegian krone  danish krone  swiss franc  total  foreign currency to be purchased under contract british pound  total  grand total  while the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk 
the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
we also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity 
at march   our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments included debt securities of  notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio at march  average interest rate cost fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate   variable rate   short term investments fixed rate   variable rate   see definition in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
