item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition including customer based programs and incentives  allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of tooling and other long lived assets and accrued warranty and customer returns 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenues when products are shipped 
all sales are final upon shipment of product to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to net sales for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to soften  the company may take actions to increase customer incentives  possibly resulting in a reduction of net sales and gross margins at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for trade accounts receivable for which collection on specific customer accounts is doubtful 
in determining collectibility  management reviews available customer financial statement information  credit rating reports as well as other external documents and public filings 
when it is deemed probable that a specific customer account is uncollectible  that balance is included in the reserve calculation 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
useful lives of tooling the company capitalizes the cost of tooling used in the production of its products by third party suppliers and global contract manufacturers 
the tooling is depreciated on a straight line basis over years  based on the nature of the product and the estimated product life cycle 
the useful lives are reviewed on a quarterly basis by management and useful lives may be shortened if needed 
in determining whether or not shortening of useful lives is required  management reviews retail sell through data  forecast demands and the timeframe of new product introductions 
accrued warranty and customer returns the company s return policy is to replace  repair or issue credit for product under warranty 
returns received during the current period are expensed as received and a reserve is maintained for future returns from current shipments 
management calculates the reserve utilizing historical return rates by product family 
these rates are reviewed and adjusted periodically 
management utilizes judgment for estimating return rates of new products and adjusts those estimates as actual results become available
