table allocation of allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to all loan categories  however  management has allocated the allowance to provide an indication of the relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allocation is an estimate and should not be interpreted as an indication that charge offs in will occur in these amounts  or that the allocation indicates future trends

among other factors  management considers the corporation s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits  and current economic conditions 
there are additional risks of future loan losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those risks include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
in  the provision for loan losses was  compared to  in and  in over the past several years  the corporation has substantially increased its portfolio of commercial  financial  and agricultural loans 
the risks associated with increasing the volume of such loans resulted in an increase in the provision for loan losses for when compared to years prior to while the corporation continues to increase its commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  the portfolio also continues to become more seasoned allowing management to better assess the risk associated with the portfolio

non performing assets total non performing assets  which consist of the corporation s non accrual loans and real estate owned  were  at december   an increase of  from december  the increase in non performing assets is a result of certain lending relationships being put on non accrual status during the year 
the corporation is closely monitoring these relationships and does not anticipate a significant loss 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is ninety days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
loans greater than ninety days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest 
for those loans which are carried on non accrual status  interest is recognized on the cash basis

impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected

new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued two statements statement  business combinations  and statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement eliminates the pooling method of accounting for business combinations and requires that intangible assets that meet certain criteria be reported separately from goodwill 
the statement also requires negative goodwill arising from a business combination to be recorded as an extraordinary gain 
statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles that are determined to have an indefinite life 
the statement requires  at a minimum  annual impairment tests for goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life 
upon adoption of these statements  an organization is required to re evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets that arose from business combinations entered into before july  if the recorded other intangible assets do not meet the criteria for recognition  they should be classified as goodwill 
similarly  if there are other intangible assets that meet the criteria for recognition but were not separately recorded from goodwill  they should be reclassified from goodwill 
an organization also must reassess the useful lives of intangible assets and adjust the remaining amortization periods accordingly 
any negative goodwill must be written off 
the standards generally are required to be implemented by the bank in its financial statements 
the adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated retirement costs 
it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it also establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  which includes long lived assets that are part of a discontinued operation 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
effects of inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different from other industries as the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
interest rates are significantly impacted by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes are directly related to price level indices 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the impacts of inflation on interest rates  loan demands  and deposits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management as the holding company for a commercial bank  the corporation s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since the majority of the corporation s interest earning assets and all of the corporation s interest bearing liabilities are held by the bank  virtually all of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
therefore  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed by management of the bank 
based on the nature of the bank s operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the virginia counties of king william  king and queen  hanover  henrico  chesterfield  middlesex  new kent  charles city  york  and james city  and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with the local economy 
as of december   the corporation does not own any trading assets nor does it have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the bank s interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital 
the bank manages interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model which measures the sensitivity of future net interest income and the net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
in addition  the bank monitors interest rate sensitivity through analysis  measuring the terms to maturity or next repricing date of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the maturities of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience a greater decrease in the cost of its liabilities relative to the yield of its assets and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income  whereas an institution with a positive gap would be expected to experience the opposite result 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of rate analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
the interest rates on loans with call features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
the corporation is also subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans  which may also affect the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position 
as part of its borrowings  the corporation may utilize  from time to time  daily  convertible and adjustable rate advances from the fhlb 
convertible advances generally provide for a fixed rate of interest for a portion of the term of the advance  an ability for the fhlb to convert the advance from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate at some predetermined time during the remaining term of the advance the conversion feature  and a concurrent opportunity for the corporation to prepay the advance with no prepayment penalty in the event the fhlb elects to exercise the conversion feature 
at december   the bank did not hold convertible advances from the fhlb 
also  the methodology used estimates various rates of withdrawal for money market deposits  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
table interest sensitivity analysis the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the time periods shown 
additionally  loans and securities with call provisions are included in the period in which they may first be called

the corporation believes that the assumptions utilized are reasonable 
the expected maturity date values for loans were calculated by adjusting the instruments contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
similarly  expected maturity date values for interest bearing core deposits were calculated based on estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  as set forth in the notes 
from a risk management perspective  however  the corporation utilizes both maturity and repricing dates  as opposed to solely using expected maturity dates 
as shown in the table  there has been no significant changes in the maturities of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities as compared to the increase in loans held for sale maturing within one year is a result of increased production at the mortgage corporation 
all loans originated at the mortgage corporation are usually sold within one month 
the increase in borrowings is also a result of the increase in loans held for sale
