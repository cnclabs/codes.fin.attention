item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading supplier of equipment and solutions to the high growth segments of the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets 
our solutions are based on a combination of patented and proprietary technologies that produce highly focused electron and ion beams 
these solutions enable our customers to view and analyze structures in three dimensions and to measure  analyze  diagnose and modify deep sub micron and atomic structures below the surface in semiconductor wafers and devices  data storage components and biological and industrial materials 
this enables our customers to develop products faster  control manufacturing processes better and improve production yields 
we refer to our comprehensive suite of products for three dimensional structural process measurement and analysis as structural process management solutions 
these solutions include focused ion beam  or fib  equipment  scanning electron microscopes  or sems  transmission electron microscopes  or tems  and dualbeam systems  which combine a fib column and a sem column on a single platform 
our customers include leading semiconductor and data storage manufacturers  as well as educational and research institutions and industrial companies located throughout the world 
we also design  manufacture and sell components of electron microscopes and fib systems to a limited number of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers 
we have research  development and manufacturing operations located in hillsboro  oregon  peabody  massachusetts  sunnyvale  california  eindhoven  the netherlands  and brno  czech republic 
we have sales and service subsidiaries in countries located throughout north america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we also use independent agents to sell some of our products in various countries  particularly in the asia pacific region 
fei was founded in to design and manufacture charged particle emitters ion and electron sources 
we began manufacturing and selling ion and electron focusing columns in the early s and began manufacturing fib workstations in in we manufactured and sold our first dualbeam systems 
in we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of philips electron optics business  a manufacturer of electron microscopes headquartered in eindhoven  the netherlands  in exchange for of our common stock outstanding after issuance 
this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and  as a result  we became a majority owned subsidiary of philips 
the combination with philips gave us expanded research and development capabilities  increased manufacturing capacity  a worldwide sales and service organization and additional financial resources 
in we acquired micrion corporation  a manufacturer of single beam fib systems headquartered in peabody  massachusetts 
the acquisition of micrion broadened our product lines  added research and development strength and expanded our sales and service capabilities in the us  japan and taiwan 
we expect to continue to expand our business in the future through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and partnerships 
from through  we experienced growth across all business segments and geographic territories and target end markets 
for  we grew in total revenues over driven by the industry and institute and data storage markets  but our components business segment decreased in revenues and we did not grow in the semiconductor end market or in the asia pacific geographic region 
growth drivers for our business in the semiconductor industry have included shrinking feature geometries  the transition to copper and new dielectrics  the transition to mm size wafers and shortening product life cycles 
in the second half of our sales were negatively affected in this end market by the worldwide semiconductor downturn 
in the data storage market  our growth is being driven by the need to measure  analyze and modify increasingly smaller sub surface features and by the need to trim smaller size pole tips for writing data to the disk surface 
in the industry and institute markets  our growth is being driven by the growing need for ultra high resolution and expanding research into biological structures and materials 
notwithstanding these factors  a downturn in general economic conditions or in the markets for our customers products could result in a reduction in demand for our products 
we make no assurances that we will be able to maintain or exceed our current level of sales in any downturn 
our standard billing terms usually include a holdback of to percent of the total selling price until completion of the installation and final acceptance of our equipment at the customer s site 
effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy to defer the portion of revenue related to installation and final acceptance until the installation and final acceptance are completed 
this change was made in accordance with the implementation of us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements or sab previously  we had recognized percent of revenue for products when title passed to the customer 
the effect of this change  net of income taxes  is reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the results of operations for this net effect reflects the deferral as of january  of million of revenue previously recognized 
we recognized all of this million in revenue during the year ended december  the net effect on our reported revenues under sab compared with our prior revenue recognition policy was a negative million for and a negative million for we expect to continue to experience volatility in our reported revenues in the near future due to the timing of revenue recognition under sab we also receive revenue from services provided to our customers 
revenue from time and materials based service arrangements is recognized as the service is performed 
revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new applications of our technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest heavily in research and development and in sales and marketing in advance of generating revenue related to these investments 
additionally  we sometimes loan equipment to customers for their use in evaluating our products 
we have also engaged in joint application development arrangements with some of our customers 
we make no assurances that these efforts will result in the sale of our equipment to these customers 
we expect to continue these practices in the future 
our customer base is diverse  but we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from sales to a few key customers  and we expect that trend to continue 
sales to our top customers accounted for of our total net sales in  of our total net sales in and of our total net sales in  however  no one customer exceeded of our net sales for  or many of our microelectronics and electron optics products carry high sales values 
our systems range in list price from about million to million 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of units  and we expect that trend to continue 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results in a given reporting period 
a substantial portion of our net sales has generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron optics products to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
accordingly  delays in shipments near the end of a quarter could have a substantial negative effect on operating results for that quarter 
announcements by our competitors or us of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing systems  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the us  and we expect that trend to continue 
total net sales outside the us were in  in and in in addition to the us dollar  we conduct significant business in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and czech korunas 
because of our substantial research  development and manufacturing operations in europe  we incur a greater proportion of our costs in europe than the revenue we derive from that geographic region 
our raw materials  labor and other manufacturing costs are primarily denominated in us dollars  euros and czech korunas 
this situation has the effect of improving our gross margins and results of operations when the dollar strengthens in relation to the euro or koruna  as was the case in  and a weakening of the dollar in relation to the euro or czech koruna would have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
movement of asian currencies in relation to the dollar and euro can also affect our reported sales and results of operations because we derive a greater proportion of revenue from the asia pacific region than the costs we incur there 
in addition  several of our competitors are based in japan and a weakening of the japanese yen has the effect of lowering their prices relative to ours 
we attempt to mitigate our currency translation and transaction exposures by using forward exchange contracts 
we also negotiate the selling currency for our products with our customers to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations 
in the past  we have derived significant benefits from our relationship with philips 
these benefits included access to patents and intellectual property and research and development services  participation in philips collective bargaining agreements and pension plans  participation in philips insurance programs  the philips credit facility  access to philips information technology systems and export and purchasing services provided by philips 
now that philips ownership of our common stock has been reduced to approximately  we have begun to incur additional labor and operating costs  which we estimate will aggregate approximately million per year 
these costs will be partially offset by payments to us from philips totaling up to million over a three year period pursuant to our agreement with philips 
during  we recognized million of these payments as a reduction to operating expenses and recognized increased operating expenses of approximately the same amount

net sales net sales include sales in our microelectronics  electron optics  components and service segments 
net sales in increased million compared to net sales in increased million compared to the following table shows our net sales by segment 
year ended december  in thousands microelectronics electron optics components customer service microelectronics segment sales increased million in compared to microelectronics segment sales increased million in compared to of the increase  million was attributable to the acquisition of micrion  which was included in our results of operations for all of compared to only five months in the broadening of our product lines  the development of new applications for our products and increased acceptance and penetration in the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets has contributed to increased sales volume for this segment 
however  our sales in this segment decreased in the second half of compared with the first half of due to the worldwide downturn in the semiconductor industry 
electron optics segment product sales increased million in compared to continued market acceptance for our tecnai tem products along with the introduction of a new smaller tem product line resulted in a increase in tem sales for sales of our sem products increased from to due to strong demand for our new quanta sem products and overall increased demand and sales volume 
electron optics segment sales increased million in compared to strong demand for our new tecnai tem products resulted in a increase in tem sales 
sales of our sem products increased from to components segment sales decreased million in compared to our component segment tends to follow the cyclical pattern of the semiconductor equipment business  which has experienced a significant downturn during components segment sales increased million in compared to demand for our component products by our oem customers increased sharply in late and continued through  as customers increased their production requirements 
service sales increased million in compared to service sales increased million in compared to the increase in service segment sales was primarily the result of an increase in the number of systems under service contracts in our installed base 
in addition  we have increased penetration in the semiconductor and data storage markets and the customers in these markets tend to have higher demands for service response time 
in general  our service contracts carry higher prices as the guaranteed response time is shortened 
year ended december  net sales by geographic region north america europe asia pacific region rest of world net sales increased from to in both north america and europe and decreased in the asia pacific region 
in north america  sales increased by million from to due to increased demand in the data storage and industry and institute markets in that region 
in europe  sales increased by million from to the growth in sales in europe was driven by increased demand in both the semiconductor and industry and institute markets 
in the asia pacific region  sales decreased by million from to the decrease is due to reduced demand in both the semiconductor and data storage sectors and the overall depressed economic conditions in that region of the world during the second half of net sales increased from to in each of the three major geographic regions in which we sell 
in north america  sales increased by million from to primarily due to increased demand for our products in the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets in that region 
in europe  sales increased by million from to primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor industry and strong demand for our new tecnai tem products 
service revenues also increased in europe due to the acquisition of the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in december as well as the increased installed base of systems 
in the asia pacific region  sales increased by million from to primarily due to increased demand in the semiconductor and data storage industries in that region 
gross profit cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead  as well as all of the costs of our customer service function such as labor  materials  travel and overhead 
gross profit as a percentage of sales  or gross margin  was in  in and in the gross margin was negatively affected by the change in our revenue recognition policy in accordance with sab without this effect  the gross margin would have been 
the gross margin was negatively affected by million of non cash inventory step up adjustments related to the micrion acquisition 
without these purchase accounting effects  the gross margin would have been in our gross margin has improved over the last three years due to several factors 
the most significant factor has been the change in our product mix 
in general  our microelectronics products carry higher gross margins than our electron optics products and our service business  and microelectronics products have increased from of our net sales in to of our net sales in our gross margins have also benefited from the favorable effect of exchange rate fluctuations discussed above under the heading overview in this section 
in addition  our gross margins have been positively affected by increased production volume  greater factory overhead absorption and lower manufacturing costs from outsourcing certain subassemblies 
our service segment gross margins from to have been positively affected by improved economies of scale from an increase in our installed base of systems 
our service segment experienced a decrease in gross margin from to primarily due to the impact of the additional sales  distribution and service operations purchased from philips in december  which have lower average service business gross margins than our other larger and more established service operations  due to a lack of economies of scale in these smaller markets 
notwithstanding the positive factors discussed above  potential pricing pressure from competitors that introduce new products into our markets or who benefit from favorable currency exchange movements in their home countries may adversely affect our gross margin in the future 
in addition  unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our cost of sales or selling prices and therefore our gross margins in the future 
our gross margins could also be adversely affected by increases in our cost for component parts 
research and development costs research and development  or r d  costs include labor  materials  overhead and payments to philips and other third parties incurred in research and development of new products and new software or enhancements to existing products and software 
r d costs increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to as a percentage of sales  r d costs were for  for and for r d costs are reported net of subsidies and capitalized software development costs 
these offsets totaled million in  million in and million in excluding the effects of these offsets  r d costs increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increase in r d costs in is attributable to increases in engineering headcount  including employees added through two small acquisitions we made in  plus a reduction in subsidy offsets from medea  a european r d funding organization 
we previously participated in various medea r d funding programs under the umbrella of philips  but those ceased when philips ownership decreased to below in we have re qualified for these programs on a stand alone basis and expect to continue to receive medea funding 
of the million increase in r d from to  million is due to the acquisition of micrion 
we are continuing to invest in the development of product improvements and upgrades  new software systems and new products to broaden the product line offerings of our business segments 
we expect our r d costs to continue to increase over time 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative  or sg a  costs include labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs include sales commissions paid to our employees as well as to our agents 
sg a costs for increased million compared to  and increased million in compared to as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in  in and in the increase in sg a costs from to was a result of higher sales volumes  increased marketing efforts  expansion of our product demonstration capabilities  as well as increased costs for insurance and other services following the separation from philips 
in we also incurred shutdown costs of million to convert our subsidiary in korea to an independent agent arrangement and severance costs of million as we eliminated some redundant positions 
the increase in sg a costs from to was partially due to the acquisition of micrion and the additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in sg a costs also increased in dollar amount from to and from to as a result of higher sales volumes 
sales commissions paid to our employees as well as to our agents increase in amount as our sales volume increases 
the decrease in sg a costs as a percentage of sales from to and from to is primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and the fact that many sg a costs are fixed or semi fixed rather than variable in nature 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology purchase accounting for the acquisition of philips electron optics division in resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that was being amortized over a year period 
purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition in august resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that was being amortized over a year period 
purchase accounting for acquisitions in resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million for existing technology that is being amortized over a year period  and goodwill of million that is not being amortized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted july   we will no longer amortize purchased goodwill effective january  under sfas no 
 amortization has been replaced with a periodic impairment test for goodwill 
amortization of such goodwill totaled million in read also note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the heading recently issued accounting pronouncements below 
amortization of purchased goodwill and technology for increased million compared to due to the amortization of existing technology from acquisitions made during amortization of purchased goodwill and technology for increased million compared to  reflecting months amortization from the micrion acquisition compared to approximately four months amortization in purchased in process research and development in  purchase accounting for acquisitions resulted in the recognition of intangible assets in the amount of million representing the estimated fair value of in process research and development 
in accordance with our policy to expense research and development costs as they are incurred  these intangible assets were written off with a charge to earnings immediately after the closing of these acquisitions 
in connection with the purchase accounting for these acquisitions  we identified two significant projects under development at the date of acquisition 
neither of these projects had been proven technologically feasible or had generated revenue as of the date of the acquisition  but both are expected to generate revenue beginning in because of the nature of these projects  there is always the risk that a technological hurdle may be encountered that may delay  prevent or increase the cost of development of these projects 
during  in connection with the purchase accounting for the micrion acquisition  we identified four significant projects under development at the date of the acquisition 
two of those projects represented enhancements to the resolution and automation of existing products designed primarily for the semiconductor industry 
enhancements from the first of these projects have been added to our product line and such enhancements are currently generating revenues 
the second project was discontinued as a separate project following the acquisition by fei  and the acquired technology was incorporated into our similar product line  which is currently generating revenues 
the third project represented enhancements to the automation of products for the data storage industry 
this technology was incorporated into the related fei product line and is currently generating revenues 
the fourth project represented development efforts on products for the lithography photo mask repair market 
this project was completed and we introduced a new line of products for the lithography photo mask repair market in  and we are currently generating revenue from such products 
none of the projects in these categories had been proven technologically feasible or had generated revenue as of the date of the acquisition 
in accordance with our policy to expense research and development costs as they are incurred  a charge of million associated with the write off of acquired in process research and development was recorded immediately subsequent to the closing of the merger

other income expense  net interest income for  and represents interest earned on the short term temporary investment of cash 
the increase in interest income in compared to is the result of increased cash balances invested  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest rates decreased significantly during the second half of completion of the common stock offering in may and the convertible debt offering in august provided additional cash that has been invested in short term marketable debt securities 
the increase in interest income in compared to is primarily the result of increased principal invested as well as higher average interest rates 
interest expense for includes  for the convertible debt issued in august the remaining interest expense in represents interest incurred on borrowings under our bank line of credit facilities and on borrowings from philips under the philips credit facility 
excluding the convertible debt interest  interest expense decreased in compared with reflecting lower levels of borrowing and lower interest rates 
some of the proceeds from the common stock offering in may were used to reduce borrowings 
interest expense for and represents interest incurred on borrowings under our bank line of credit facilities and on borrowings from philips under the philips credit facility 
interest expense increased in compared with  reflecting higher levels of borrowing and higher average interest rates 
in july  the company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the assets of surface interface  and the acquisition closed in august as a result of this agreement  we adjusted the carrying value of our existing investment in surface interface to reflect the purchase price in the definitive agreement and recorded a valuation charge to earnings of million in the third quarter of income tax expense our effective income tax rate on pre tax book income was negative for  for and for our effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the effects of state and foreign taxes and our use of a foreign sales corporation for exports from the us  research and experimentation tax credits earned in the us  the nondeductible write off of purchased in process research and development costs  the amortization of goodwill that is not deductible for income tax purposes as well as other factors 
the effective rate was adversely affected primarily by the charge for in process research and development associated with the micrion acquisition 
the effective rate was adversely affected primarily by goodwill amortization 
the effective tax rate was adversely affected primarily by state and foreign taxes  in process research and development on acquisitions and goodwill amortization and was positively affected by tax credits for research and experimentation 
read also note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to the factors mentioned above  our effective income tax rate on pre tax book income can be affected by changes in statutory tax rates in the us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability or inability to utilize various carry forward tax items  changes in tax laws in the us governing research and experimentation credits and foreign sales corporations and other factors 
the world trade organization recently ruled against the us tax policies covering us exports and it is unclear what action  if any  the us government may take in response to this ruling 
therefore  we are not able to estimate the future effective income tax rate we may incur 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our revenue recognition policy to defer the portion of the billing related to installation and final acceptance at the customer site until the installation and final acceptance are completed 
this change was made in accordance with sab the effect of this change  net of income taxes  is reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the year ended december  this net effect reflects the deferral as of january  of million of revenue previously recognized 
all such revenue initially deferred on january  upon adoption of sab was recognized during liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by million in to million as of december  the most significant reasons for this increase in cash were the common stock offering in may  the convertible debt offering in august and positive cash flows from operations of million 
in  cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million as of december   primarily as a result of positive cash flows from operations 
excluding the effects of changes in working capital components  operating activities generated million of cash in  million in  and million of cash in the improved cash flow from operations was primarily due to improved operating results over this three year period 
short term investments were million as of december  these investments represent marketable debt securities which had maturities greater than days when we purchased them 
all such investments are scheduled to mature in less than months from the balance sheet date 
we intend to hold these securities to their maturity dates 
accounts receivable decreased million from to and increased million from to the decrease in receivables in was due to improved collections 
for  the increase in receivables was due to increased sales volume 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  improved from days in the fourth quarter of to days in the fourth quarter of inventories increased million from to and million from to the increase in was primarily due to increased production materials on hand  which includes our mm product line  and an increase in loaner systems at key customer accounts where we are jointly developing applications 
as a result of this increase in inventory  our inventory turnover rate  calculated on a quarterly basis  went from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of current liabilities increased million from to and million from to these increases resulted from growth in our business 
we incurred capital expenditures for acquisition of equipment of million in  million in and million in these expenditures included application laboratory and demonstration systems  which exhibit the capabilities of our equipment to our customers and potential customers 
we have expanded our demonstration capabilities over the last three years 
the lower capital spending level in was in anticipation of the business combination with micrion  which added both domestic and offshore application laboratory and demonstration equipment 
we also invest in equipment for development  manufacturing and testing purposes 
we lease the real property used in our business 
we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures to further expand our business  particularly for demonstration equipment and loaner systems 
we also invest in internally developed software  which controls our equipment and provides information from the equipment for use by customers 
we capitalized software development costs of million in  million in and million in we also expect to continue to invest in software development as we develop new software for our existing products and new products under development 
during  and we made several business investments in addition to ongoing investments in equipment and product development 
the largest of these investments was the august purchase of micrion 
purchase consideration for this transaction  including transaction costs  consisted of cash and shares of our common stock totaling million 
the cash portion of the purchase price  paid to micrion s former shareholders  totaled million 
in december we acquired additional sales  distribution and service operations from philips in a number of smaller market areas 
purchase consideration included a cash payment of million to philips  which was recorded as a dividend because the transaction was between entities under common control 
in september we invested million to acquire a interest in surface interface  inc  a start up company  which introduced an atomic force microscopy tool for the semiconductor industry 
in conjunction with the investment  we entered into a distribution agreement through which we marketed  sold and serviced the equipment 
we also obtained an option to purchase additional equity at a predetermined price 
in june we invested an additional million in surface interface  bringing our ownership percentage to as of december  in august we purchased all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of surface interface 
the purchase price of million included million cash   shares of fei common stock valued at million  the assumption of million of surface interface s liabilities and the adjusted value of our previous investment and advances to surface interface of million 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of deschutes corporation 
the purchase price of million included million of cash   shares of fei common stock valued at million and million of liabilities assumed 
the purchase price may be increased by an additional amount of up to million consisting of  shares of fei common stock valued at million and million of cash if certain milestones are met within months after closing 
we expect to continue to use acquisition and investment opportunities to augment our growth and market position 
on february  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement with philips  our majority shareholder at the time 
in august this philips credit facility was amended  increasing our borrowing capacity to million 
as of december   borrowings under the credit facility were million 
on july   we terminated the credit facility with philips  and the outstanding balance was repaid in full 
we are currently holding discussions with several banks about a replacement credit facility  and we expect to implement such a facility in we expect that if we establish such a new bank credit facility  the terms will carry a higher cost than the terms of our prior philips credit facility 
we also maintain a million unsecured and uncommitted bank borrowing facility in the us and various limited facilities in selected foreign countries 
in addition  we maintain a million unsecured and uncommitted bank facility in the us and a million facility in the netherlands for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit bank guarantees 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit bank guarantees totaling approximately million to secure customer advance deposits under these bank facilities 
we also had outstanding at december  million of foreign bank guarantees that are secured by cash balances 
on august   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes  due august   through a private offering 
our proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and debt issuance expenses  totaled million 
the notes are redeemable at our option beginning in  or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually 
the notes are convertible into our common stock  at the note holder s option  at a price of per share at any time up through their maturity 
we are using the proceeds of this note offering for working capital and general corporate purposes 
operations are conducted in manufacturing and administrative facilities under operating leases that extend through the lease agreements generally provide for payment of base rental amounts plus our share of property taxes and common area costs 
the leases generally provide renewal options at current market rates 
rent expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
rent expense was million in  million in and million in on may   we completed a public offering of  shares of fei common stock sold by us and  shares of fei common stock sold by philips 
our proceeds  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses  totaled million 
we used million of the proceeds from this stock offering to pay off the philips line of credit and are using the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes 
with completion of the offering  philips ownership of fei common stock was reduced to approximately million shares  or of the total fei common shares outstanding  compared with ownership prior to the offering 
in august  in connection with the acquisition of micrion  we sold  shares to philips business electronics in a private transaction providing million in net proceeds to us 
we also issue shares under our employee stock purchase plan  which enables employees to purchase our stock at a discount to market price at fixed points in time 
we also grant options to purchase our shares to many of our employees and directors as part of incentive and other compensation programs 
during  shares were sold or granted under these programs as compared to  shares sold or granted in and  shares sold or granted in these programs generated cash of million in  million in and million in from time to time we have repurchased our own common stock in the open market and retired the shares 
on september  we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
the program may be suspended at any time or from time to time by our board of directors 
during  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million under this program 
in we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million 
we assess liquidity needs by evaluating cash balances on hand  available borrowings under our credit facilities  working capital trends and expected cash flows from operating activities versus our investment needs 
in consideration of these factors  we believe that we have adequate financial resources for at least the next months 
the following table shows our estimated contractual commitments 
year ended december  thereafter total debt repayments operating leases purchase commitments holders of this convertible note debt may require the company to repurchase the notes prior to maturity in the event of a change of control of the company  as further described in the note indenture 
these non cancelable operating lease and purchase commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the us we issue standby letters of credit and bank guarantees from time to time in the normal course of our business 
the following table shows the expiration periods for the standby letters of credit and bank guarantees we had outstanding at december  year ended december  thereafter total standby letters of credit and bank guarantees lease guarantees these contingent obligations are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the us related party activity before may   philips owned a majority interest in fei 
as a consolidated affiliate of philips  we participated in certain philips sponsored or administered programs 
following the sale of fei stock by philips  we no longer participate in certain philips sponsored or administered programs 
we continue to purchase certain of these services from philips and certain other of these services are procured from other suppliers 
the cost to procure these services from other suppliers and from philips subsequent to may  exceeds the amounts previously paid to philips 
under terms of a supplemental agreement effective december   philips will pay up to million to the company over a three year period to reduce the effect of these increased costs 
these payments would terminate on a change of control of fei  as defined in the agreement 
during  we recognized million of these payments as a reduction to operating expenses and recognized increased operating expenses of approximately the same amount 
a number of philips sales organizations acted as distributors for our products in their respective countries until november in addition  certain philips business units purchase our products and services for internal use 
sales to philips amounted to million  million and million during  and  respectively 
a substantial portion of the subassemblies included in our fibs  tems and sems are purchased from philips enabling technologies group 
materials purchases from philips and its affiliates amounted to million in  million in and million in additional discussion of related party transactions is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
significant accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  warranty liabilities  income tax related contingencies  the lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets such as existing technology intangibles and goodwill  and the timing of revenue recognition 
it is reasonably possible the estimates may change in the near future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection problems  known trends with current customers  and the need for a general overall reserve against receivables to cover unknown future collection problems 
the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies somewhat mitigates our credit risk exposure and the magnitude of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory is stated at lower of cost or market with cost determined by standard cost methods  which approximate the first in  first out method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
reserves for inventory obsolescence and excess quantities are established based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products  and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a substantial supply of parts for possible use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher percentage of reserve against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it is to ultimately be used 
purchased goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination  was amortized through december  on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life for acquisitions made before july  for acquisitions made after june   purchased goodwill is not amortized 
effective january   purchased goodwill will also not be amortized for acquisitions made before july  we must periodically evaluate the fair value of purchased goodwill and determine if there has been any impairment in the recorded value 
see also the heading recently issued accounting pronouncements below 
existing technology intangible assets purchased in a business combination  which represent the estimated value of products utilizing technology existing as of the combination date discounted to their net present value  are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the technology 
we are currently using amortization periods ranging from years to years for these assets 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful lives of such assets 
please also read note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we capitalize certain software development costs for software expected to be sold within our products 
such costs are capitalized after the technological feasibility of the project is determined and are reported on the balance sheet in other assets 
once we begin to include such software in our products  these costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the software  which is usually years 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
our products generally carry a one year warranty 
a reserve is established at the time of sale to cover estimated warranty costs and certain commitments for product upgrades 
our estimate of warranty cost is based primarily on our history of warranty repairs and maintenance 
for our new products without a history of known warranty costs  we estimate the expected costs based on our experience with similar product lines and technology 
while most new products are extensions of existing technology  the estimate could change if new products require a significantly different level of repair and maintenance than similar products have required in the past 
for products produced according to our published specifications  revenue is recognized when the title to the product and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product meets the customer s specifications and when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
in each case  the portion of revenue applicable to installation and customer acceptance is recognized upon meeting specifications at the installation site 
for new applications of the company s products where performance cannot be assured prior to meeting specifications at the installation site  no revenue is recognized until such specifications are met 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  effective july  sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we have used the purchase method of accounting for all acquisitions in our history 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement requires discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  these assets are to be tested periodically for impairment and written down to their fair market value as necessary 
sfas no 
becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are evaluating sfas no 
 and other than the cessation of amortization of goodwill  we have not yet determined the impact of adoption on our financial position or results of operations 
the amount of amortization expense for goodwill was million in we expect to complete our evaluation of impairment under sfas no 
no later than june  sfas no

backlog our backlog consists of purchase orders we have received for products and services we expect to ship and deliver within the next months  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
at december  our total backlog was million 
at december  our total backlog was million 
customers may cancel or delay delivery on previously placed orders  although our standard terms and conditions include penalties for cancellations made close to the scheduled delivery date 
a substantial portion of our backlog relates to orders for products with a relatively high average selling price 
as a result  the timing of the receipt of orders or the shipment of products could have a significant impact on our backlog at any date 
for this and other reasons  the amount of backlog at any date is not necessarily indicative of revenue in future periods 
quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table presents unaudited consolidated financial data for each of the eight quarters in and in our opinion  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for these periods 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the results for the three months ended july  include a charge of million in other expense  net to adjust the carrying value of the investment in surface interface as a result of the acquisition 
the results of the three months ended september  include a charge of million in operating expenses for purchased in process research and development associated with acquisitions 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we changed our accounting method for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of  effective january   in accordance with the requirements of sab accordingly  the results for the three months ended april   include the cumulative effect of implementing sab april july september december net sales cost of sales gross profit total operating expenses operating income other expense  net income before taxes income tax expense net income income per share basic diluted shares used in per share calculation basic diluted april july october december net sales cost of sales gross profit total operating expenses operating income other expense  net income before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle per share basic diluted shares used in per share calculation basic diluted our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of our microelectronics and electron optics products  competitive pricing pressures  conditions in our principal markets  the timing of orders from major customers  new product introductions  customer cancellation or delay of shipments  long sales cycles  changes in the mix of products sold and the proportion of domestic and international sales  specific feature requests by customers  product delays and supply chain difficulties and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of microelectronics and electron optics products 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition from a single order could have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for a reporting period 
a substantial portion of our net sales have generally been realized near the end of each quarter and sales of electron optics products to government funded customers have generally been significantly higher in the fourth quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a large portion of our business is conducted outside of the us through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates which fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect the consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the major foreign currencies in which we face periodic fluctuations are the euro and prior to the related underlying european currencies  the czech koruna  the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
although for each of the last three years more than of our sales occurred outside of the us  a large portion of these foreign sales were denominated in us dollars and euros 
as a result of an overall strengthening of the us dollar against european currencies and japanese yen in  net sales were negatively affected 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments increased shareholders equity and comprehensive income for by million 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
from time to time we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific receivables or payables positions 
as of december   the aggregate stated amount of these contracts was million 
holding other variables constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
the decrease in value would be substantially offset from the revaluation of the underlying hedged transactions 
interest rate sensitivity we borrowed funds under variable rate borrowing arrangements through july we have not hedged our exposure to interest rate risk 
since we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   we would not experience a material impact on our income before taxes as the result of a increase in short term interest rates 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed rate commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds and other fixed rate securities  with maturities less than one year 
an increase or decrease in interest rates of would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have the intent and ability to hold these fixed rate investments until maturity
