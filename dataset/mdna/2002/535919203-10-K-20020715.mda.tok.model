in fiscal  the majority of the million use of cash in investing activities was due to the acquisition of trimark and in fiscal the entire million use of cash was due to the purchase of property and equipment 
our liquidity and capital resources were provided during the year ended march  principally through cash generated from operations  a us million cdn million borrowing base revolving credit facility with jp morgan securities which closed in september  and german tax shelter financing  which has been made available to us on several productions including frailty  cat s meow  liberty stands still and i fought the law  which were all delivered in fiscal the credit facility is limited by our borrowing base  which includes certain accounts receivable and library credits 
management projects that the difference between the borrowing base and the amount borrowed over the next four quarters will be positive resulting in excess borrowing capacity 
in december  the third party valuation of our borrowing base films and television programs library was updated as at september  in accordance with the valuation methods used  the borrowing base excludes unreleased theatrical projects at september  such as monster s ball  the wash and frailty 
at march   the borrowing base assets totaled us million cdn million 
the nature of our business is such that significant initial expenditures are required to produce and acquire films and television programs  while revenues from these films and television programs are earned over an extended period of time after their completion or acquisition 
as our operations grow  our financing requirements are expected to grow and management projects the continued use of cash in operating activities and therefore we are dependent on continued access to external sources of financing 
we believe that cash flow from operations  cash on hand  credit lines available and tax shelter financing available will be adequate to meet known operational cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including the funding of future film and television production  film rights acquisitions  and theatrical and video release schedules 
we monitor our cash flow  interest coverage  liquidity  capital base and debt to total capital ratios with the long term goal of maintaining our creditworthiness 
our current financing strategy is to finance substantially with equity at the corporate level and to leverage investment in film and television programs through operating credit facilities and single purpose production financing 
we usually obtain financing commitments  including  in some cases  funds from government incentive programs and foreign distribution commitments to cover  on average  at least of the budgeted third party costs of a project before commencing production 
our convertible  non voting redeemable series a preferred shares are entitled to cumulative dividends  as and when declared by the board of directors  payable semi annually on the last day of march and september of each year 
we have the option of paying such dividends either in cash or additional preferred shares 
we paid the march  dividend in additional preferred shares 
we do not pay and do not intend to pay  and are restricted from paying by our revolving credit facility  dividends on common shares  giving consideration to our business strategy and investment opportunities 
we believe it to be in the best interest of shareholders to invest all available cash in the expansion of our business 
critical accounting policies we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we accrue for video returns and allowances in the financial statements based on previous returns and allowances history on a title by title basis in each of the video businesses 
there may be differences between actual returns and allowances and our historical experience 
we capitalize costs of production  including financing costs  and distribution to investment in films and television programs 
these costs are amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with sop these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized film or television program costs or fair value 
these costs for an individual film or television program are amortized in the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to management s estimates of the total revenue expected to be received from such film or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of delivery 
as a result  if revenue estimates change with respect to a film or television program  we may be required to write down all or a portion of the unamortized costs of such film or television program 
no assurance can be given that unfavorable changes to revenue estimates will not occur  which may result in significant write downs affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
revenue is driven by audience acceptance of a film or television program  which represents a response not only to artistic merits but also to critics reviews  marketing and the competitive market for entertainment  general economic conditions  and other intangible factors  all of which can change rapidly 
actual production costs may exceed budgets 
risk of labour disputes  disability of a star performer  rapid changes in production technology  shortage of necessary equipment and locations or adverse weather conditions may cause cost overruns 
we generally maintain insurance policies completion bonds and essential elements insurance on key talent  mitigating certain of these risks 
currency risk management additionally  as part of our overall risk management program  we evaluate and manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and currency exchange risks on an ongoing basis 
in the current year we entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risk on one television production 
these forward exchange contracts do not subject us to risk from exchange rate movements because gains and losses on the contracts offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 
no collateral or other security was pledged as security to support these financial instruments 
other hedges and derivative financial instruments will be used in the future  within guidelines approved or to be approved by the board of directors for counterparty exposure  limits and hedging practices  in order to manage our interest rate and currency exposure 
we have no intention of entering into financial derivative contracts  other than to hedge a specific financial risk 
our principal currency exposure is between canadian and us dollars  although this exposure has been significantly mitigated through the structuring of the us million revolving credit facility as a us million canadian dollar facility and a us million us dollar credit facility 
each facility is borrowed and repaid in the respective country of origin  in local currency 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from the financial debt instruments that arise from transactions entered into during the normal course of business 
debt 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in market interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
for example  our credit facilities and some of our long term debt bears interest on borrowings outstanding at various time intervals and at market rates based on either the canadian prime rate or the us prime rate  plus a margin ranging from to 
our principal risk with respect to our long term debt is changes in these market rates

we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies and are subject to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in certain instances  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
we currently intend to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge future production expenses denominated in canadian  australian and new zealand dollars 
gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are capitalized and recorded as production costs when the gains and losses are realized 
at march   we had contracts to sell us million in exchange for cdn million over a period of nine months at a weighted average exchange rate of 
during the year  we completed foreign exchange contracts denominated in australian and new zealand dollars 
the net loss resulting from the completed contracts amount to nil 
these contracts are entered into with a major financial institution 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty  which is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts  at current market rates 
we do not require collateral or other security to support these contracts 
unrecognized gains at march  amounted to cdn million
