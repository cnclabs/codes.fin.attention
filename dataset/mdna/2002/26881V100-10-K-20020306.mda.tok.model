we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and the results of moss operations subsequent to april  have been included in our operating results for the year ended december  on september   we performed an impairment assessment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of rightpoint  ileverage  octane  eclass and moss and our acquisition of certain intellectual property assets of radnet and recorded an impairment charge as described below 
amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles we periodically assess the impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangibles in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we also periodically assess the impairment of enterprise level goodwill in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
as part of our review of our third quarter financial results  we performed an impairment assessment of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in connection with all of our acquisitions 
the impairment assessment was performed with the assistance of independent valuation experts to determine whether any impairment existed 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the significant decline in our stock price  the net book value of assets which significantly exceeded our market capitalization  and the overall decline in industry growth rates which have negatively impacted our revenues and forecasted revenue growth rates 
the decline in revenues and forecasted revenue growth rates precipitated our reduction in workforce and overall restructuring in the quarter ended september  as a result  we recorded a billion impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets associated with all of our acquisitions to reflect their current estimated fair market value 
fair market value was determined based on discounted future cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates and assumptions used under our assessment may change in the short term resulting in the need to further write down our goodwill and other long lived assets 
the aggregate amortization and write down of goodwill and these other intangible assets increased to billion for the year ended 
table of contents december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the billion impairment of goodwill and intangible assets charge that was included in the results of operations for the year ended december  no indicators were present in the quarter ended december  warranting a further impairment of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
beginning on january   our unamortized balance of million of goodwill and other intangible assets will be subject to new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
and sfas no 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  all acquired goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to a periodic impairment assessment 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets of million on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives 
amortization related to these intangibles is expected to be million for  million for and million for please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
stock option exchange program on april   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  employees were given the opportunity to elect to cancel outstanding stock options held by them in exchange for an equal number of new options to be granted at a future date at the then current fair market value 
these elections needed to be made by may  and were required to include all options granted during the prior six month period 
a total of employees elected to participate in the exchange program 
those employees tendered a total of  options to purchase our common stock in return for our promise to grant new options on the grant date of november  a total of  options were granted at the fair market value of per share on november  to those employees who had been continuously employed with us from the date they tendered their original options through november  the exchange program was not made available to our executive officers  directors  consultants  former employees or any of our employees who were residents of the netherlands  switzerland  spain or brazil or who were employed by our subsidiaries located in those countries 
restructuring and related activities in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan to restructure our worldwide operations including a reduction in workforce and the consolidation of our operating facilities 
the restructuring resulted in a total charge of million to account for these activities 
of this total charge  million was paid in cash and million reflects a non cash charge taken during the quarters ended september  and december  we recorded the low end of a range of assumptions modeled for the restructuring charge  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy we generate revenues principally from licensing our software solutions directly to customers and providing related services including implementation  consulting  support and training 
through december   substantially all of our revenues were generated by our direct sales force 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a software license fee to perpetually use one or more software solutions within specified limits 
the amount of the license fee varies depending on which software solution is purchased  the number of software solutions purchased and the scope of usage rights 
customers can subsequently pay additional license fees to expand the right to use previously licensed software solutions  or to purchase additional software solutions 
each software solution included in the e 
piphany system contains the same core technology  allowing for easy integration of additional software solutions as they are licensed from us 
our software solutions are made available either on compact disc or electronically 
customers generally require consulting and implementation services  which include evaluating their business needs  identifying the data sources necessary to meet these needs and installing the software solution in a manner that fulfills their requirements 
customers can purchase these services directly from third party consulting organizations  such as accenture  deloitte touche  kpmg consulting and 
table of contents pricewaterhousecoopers  or alternatively  they can purchase these services directly from us through our internal professional services organization 
consulting and implementation services can be acquired on either a fixed fee or a time and expense basis 
we have also historically supplemented the capacity of our internal professional services organization by subcontracting some of these services to third party consulting organizations 
fees from licenses are recognized as revenue upon contract execution  provided that all delivery obligations have been met  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee between all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the time at which such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or all elements are delivered 
fees from license agreements that include the right to receive unspecified future products are recognized over the term of the arrangement or  if not specified  the estimated economic life of the product 
when we receive license fees from resellers  we recognize revenue when the above criteria have been met and the reseller has sold the subject licenses through to the end user 
when licenses are sold together with consulting and implementation services  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that the above criteria have been met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting and implementation services  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
for arrangements that don t meet the above criteria  both the product license revenues and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the implementation services  we account for the arrangements under the percentage of completion contract method pursuant to sop when such estimates are not available  the completed contract method is utilized 
to date  when we have been primarily responsible for the implementation of the software  services have been considered essential to the functionality of the software products and therefore have been recognized pursuant to sop prior to  e 
piphany was primarily responsible for the implementation services for the majority of its license arrangements 
in  third party consulting organizations were primarily responsible for the implementation services for the majority of e 
piphany s license arrangements and therefore less license revenue was recognized pursuant to sop maintenance agreements generally call for us to provide technical support and software updates to customers 
revenue from technical support and software updates is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement and is included in services revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we also provide consulting  implementation and training services to our customers separately from our sales of product licenses 
revenue from such services  when not sold in conjunction with product licenses  is generally recognized as the services are performed 
cost of revenues and operating expenses our cost of license revenues primarily consist of license fees due to third parties for integrated technology 
our cost of services revenues include salaries and related expenses for our implementation  consulting  support and training organizations  costs of subcontracting to consulting organizations to provide consulting services to customers and an allocation of facilities  communications and depreciation expenses 
our operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
we allocate the costs for overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use the overhead and facilities services based on their headcount 
these allocated charges include facility rent for corporate offices  communication charges and depreciation expenses for office furniture and equipment 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development costs as incurred 
since license revenues from our software solutions are not 
table of contents recognized until after technological feasibility has been established  software development costs are not generally expensed in the same period in which license revenues for the developed products are recognized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and restructuring 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
where our internal services organization is providing services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue and profit as implementation services are performed on software license arrangements  using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
we recorded an impairment charge in the quarter ended september  in order to write down the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill value on a periodic basis 
in the event that in the future  it is determined that the goodwill value has been impaired  an adjustment to goodwill will be made resulting in a charge for the write down in the period in which the determination was made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing income in the period in which such determination was made 
we took a restructuring charge in the quarter ended september  that resulted in an accrual to be used to offset future rent expense  net of sublease income  that is related to abandoned properties 
we took a further related charge in the quarter ended december  in order to adjust our initial accrual  on the basis of revised estimates 
we have worked with external real estate experts in each of the markets where the properties are located to determine what the best estimate of the accrual should be 
however  if the real estate market continues to worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected  additional adjustments to the accrual may be required  which would result in additional restructuring costs in the period in which such determination is made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens  and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  adjustments to the accrual may be required that would increase net income in the period in which such determination is made

for the year ended  domestic revenue declined by million or 
this decrease was offset in part by an increase in 
table of contents international revenues of million or 
this rapid growth in international revenues reflected the early stage of development of our international operations and we do not expect international revenues to increase at the same rate in the future 
maintaining revenues at the level of the fourth quarter of would result in lower annual revenues for as compared to product license revenues decreased to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  product license revenues increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of this increase was offset by a decrease for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of this decrease in product license revenues was primarily due to the downturn in the economy and weakness in information technology spending  particularly in the united states 
although sequentially down from to  license revenues were sequentially flat for the last three quarters of services revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  services revenues increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of this increase was offset by a decrease for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of the decrease was due in part to the decrease in product license revenues and in part to the change in our strategy from fulfilling most of our customers consulting needs with our internal services professionals to encouraging our customers to contract directly with third party integrators 
this approach was adopted in conjunction with our overall strategy to strengthen our alliances with system integrators that recommend and implement our software on customers computer systems 
the decrease in consulting revenue was offset by an increase in maintenance revenue attributable to maintenance contracts sold to our new customers 
the relative amount of services revenues as compared to license revenues has varied depending on the extent to which third party consulting organizations are engaged directly by customers to provide professional services  the nature of the solution that has been licensed  the complexity of customers information technology environment  the resources allocated by customers to implementation projects and the scope of licensed rights 
services revenues have substantially lower margins relative to product license revenues 
this is especially true when we are required to subcontract with consulting organizations to supplement our internal professional services organization 
to the extent that services revenues become a greater percentage of our total revenues and services margins do not increase  our overall gross margins will decline 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues was effectively unchanged at million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of product license revenues consists primarily of license fees paid to third parties under technology license arrangements and have not been significant to date 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of the costs of consulting  maintenance and training services 
cost of services revenues decreased to million  or of services revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of services revenues  for the year ended december  cost of services revenue increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of this increase was offset by a decrease in the cost of services revenue for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of the decrease was the result of a significant reduction in the number of internal professional services employees due to the change in our strategy from fulfilling all of our customers consulting needs with our internal services professionals to encouraging our customers to contract directly with third party integrators 
this approach was adopted in conjunction with our overall strategy to strengthen our alliances with system integrators that recommend and implement our software 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to a higher proportion of maintenance revenue  which has more favorable margins 

table of contents operating expenses research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with our product development efforts 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a higher number of research and development employees entering as compared to as a result of internal growth and acquisitions  and increased fees paid to outside contractors for the translation of our products 
this increase was offset by the restructuring of our operations that occurred in the third quarter of  which resulted in a reduction in the number of employees and a restructuring charge that reduced operating expenses in the third and fourth quarters of we believe that investments in product development are essential to our future success 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase over the long term 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  and the costs of trade shows  seminars  promotional materials and other sales and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of sales and marketing employees entering as compared to  resulting from internal growth and acquisitions 
in this regard  we established sales offices in additional domestic and international locations including ones in asia  australia  europe and latin america 
this increase was offset by the restructuring of our operations that occurred in the third quarter of  which resulted in a reduction in the number of employees and in a restructuring charge that reduced operating expenses in the third and fourth quarters of maintaining sales and marketing expenses at the level of the fourth quarter would result in lower annual expenses for as compared to we anticipate  however  that these expenses may increase over the long term 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees entering as compared to  which were necessary to support our expanding operations

in process research and development charge in connection with the acquisitions of rightpoint and octane  we recorded charges for in process research and development of million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net 
table of contents cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by rightpoint  octane and their competitors 
at the acquisition dates  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the dates of acquisition 
there was no in process research and development charge incurred during the year ended december  please see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles our acquisitions of moss  octane  eclass  ileverage and rightpoint were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the aggregate amortization and write down of goodwill and other intangible assets was billion and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to the billion impairment of goodwill and intangible assets charge that was included in the results of operations for the year ended december  beginning on january   our unamortized balance of million of goodwill and other intangible assets will be subject to the new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
and sfas no 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result acquired goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to a periodic impairment assessment 
the company will continue to amortize other intangible assets of million on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives 
amortization related to these intangibles is expected to be million for  million for and million for stock based compensation stock based compensation consists of amortization of deferred compensation in connection with stock option grants and sales of stock to employees at exercise or sales prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock and compensation related to equity instruments issued to non employees for services rendered 
in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees during the years ended december   and  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million   and million  respectively 
as of december   deferred compensation remaining to be amortized totaled million 
this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of these equity instruments in a manner consistent with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
total stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the accounting treatment for stock based compensation 
interest income  net interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower average cash and investment balances and a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments 
provision for income taxes from inception through december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had and million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  respectively  to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire on varying dates beginning in through and the state 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards begin to expire on various dates through certain future changes in our share ownership  as defined in the tax reform act of and similar state provisions  may restrict the utilization of carryforwards 
given our limited operating history  our losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  management does not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax asset meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted from the receipt of proceeds from our secondary offering completed during the first quarter of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted from the proceeds from our initial public offering  borrowings against a line of credit and issuances of convertible preferred and common stock 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and million in short term investments 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure a bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have international operations in asia  australia  europe and latin america and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
to date  our exposure to fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has been limited because substantially all of our assets are denominated in us dollars  and those assets which are not denominated in us dollars have generally been denominated in historically stable currencies 
therefore  the impact to our financial statements has not been material 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange hedges or other derivative financial instruments 
we will continue to evaluate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on a regular basis 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million that consist of cash and highly liquid short term investments having maturity dates of no more than days 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately million 
as of december   we had short term investments of million that consist of taxable fixed income securities having maturity dates of no more than one year 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
based upon our balance of short term investments  a decrease in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately million 
as of december   we did not have any short term or long term debt outstanding
