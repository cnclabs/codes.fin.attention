critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec issued statements regarding disclosure by companies within their management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in those statements  the sec encouraged companies to identify critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in response to the sec statements  management has identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the company recognizes revenues and the related costs for its services in the periods for which such services are provided 
many customers pay for these services in advance 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheet represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september   are included in deferred contract revenue  and are stated net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates 
management believes that the amount of deferred revenue shown at the respective consolidated balance sheet dates fairly represents the level of business activity it expects to conduct with customers invoiced under this arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgments and estimates are utilized in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of the company s accounts receivable balances may become uncollectable 
specifically  management analyzes accounts in relation to receivable aging trends  economic factors  and changes in customer payment history in establishing this allowance 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance of  as of september  and  as of september   amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  property  plant equipment plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily thirty years for buildings and three to eight years for equipment 
landauer assesses the carrying value of its property plant and equipment and the remaining useful lives whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger this review included competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets are comprised of goodwill  purchased customer lists  licenses and patents 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but be reviewed periodically for impairment 
for acquisitions completed prior to june   the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets has ceased beginning in fiscal year the provisions of sfas no 
that pertain to impairment of intangible assets have superseded the impairment related provisions included in sfas no 
 beginning in fiscal year under sfas no 
 the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized must be based generally on fair values  instead of projected future undiscounted cash flows 
the fair values of these assets were calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses 
as a result of initially applying the new impairment provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment loss was required 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily ten years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years
