all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal year  which ends on june for example  a reference to or fiscal means the month period that ended on june  historical overview on january   the company completed its separation from kpmg llp the separation 
as a partnership  all of kpmg llp s earnings were allocable to its partners 
accordingly  distributions and benefits to partners were not reflected as an expense in the historical financial statements through january  additionally  as a partnership  kpmg llp was not subject to income taxes and  as a result  the historical financial statements through january  do not include a provision for income taxes 
effective february   following the separation from kpmg llp and the company s commencement of operations in corporate form  the historical financial statements include payments for services rendered by our managing directors  who were formerly consulting partners of kpmg llp  in professional compensation  and a provision for income taxes 
consequently  the historical results of operations for the years ended june  and  which reflect a corporate basis of presentation  and the summation of the five months ended june   which reflect a corporate basis of presentation  and the seven months ended january   which reflect a partnership basis of presentation  are not directly comparable 
accordingly  to enhance comparability  for purposes of this discussion and analysis  the operating results for fiscal have been presented on a pro forma basis assuming the separation from kpmg llp occurred as of july  at which time the company would have commenced operations in corporate form

upon consolidation  all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation  including the following significant reclassifications to the statements of operations 
reclassification of costs from other costs of service to professional compensation for compensation and fringe benefit expenses related to certain billable consulting staff  
reclassification of costs from other costs of service to selling  general and administrative expenses related to an overhead cost allocation  
reclassification of amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles from costs of service to selling  general and administrative expenses  
transfer of our health care business to our high technology and public services groups  and 
formation of our north american region by reclassification of our canadian operations from international by combining it with us operations 
through january   we were a division of kpmg llp 
our combined financial statements for the seven months ended january   which includes all majority owned subsidiaries of kpmg llp that were deemed part of our consulting business  have been prepared using kpmg llp s historical basis of accounting in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america and includes the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses related to our business 
included in our expenses are allocations of certain costs incurred by kpmg llp on behalf of our business 
these allocations are discussed in greater detail in the notes to financial statements located elsewhere in this form k 
since we historically operated as part of the partnership of kpmg llp  our consulting partners shared in the annual profits of kpmg llp rather than receiving salaries 
therefore  our historical combined financial statements for the seven months ended january  do not reflect any compensation or benefit costs for services rendered by the consulting partners of kpmg llp 
in connection with the separation  the consulting partners of kpmg llp resigned from kpmg llp and became our managing directors 
effective february   our managing directors began to receive salaries and other benefits as their compensation  and our company began operating in corporate form and became subject to income taxes 
segments during fiscal  we provided consulting services through five major industry groups including public services  financial services  communications and content  high technology  and consumer and industrial markets 
commencing july   our health care group was combined with our public services and high technology groups and the business units in our canadian practice were transferred from international to the five industry groups  resulting in a north america region 
in addition  we have multinational regional operations in asia pacific  latin america  israel and following the acquisition of kca and the other transactions described above  in europe 
the company s chief operating decision maker  the chairman and chief executive officer  evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon the industry groups 
performance of the segments is evaluated on operating income excluding the costs of infrastructure functions such as information systems  finance and accounting  human resources  legal and marketing 
prior year information has been reclassified to reflect current year changes 
the discussion and analysis related to critical accounting policies and to each operational expense category applies to all segments  unless otherwise indicated 
recent trends in our business the level of economic activity in the industries and regions we serve is a primary factor affecting our revenues 
in addition  changes in business requirements and practices of our clients have a significant impact on the demand for technology consulting and systems integration services we provide 
the current economic downturn has negatively affected the operations of some of our clients and their it spending 
during this time  competition for new engagements and pricing pressure have remained strong 
as a result  we have seen a decline in our revenues in fiscal we do not expect that business volumes will significantly improve before the end of calendar we have responded to these business conditions by carefully balancing our resources with engagement staffing requirements  eliminating excess capacity through workforce reductions and aggressively reducing discretionary costs to lower the cost of operations and maintain profit margins 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most critical to the company s financial condition and operating results pertain to revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues including estimates of costs to complete engagements  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  and intra period estimates of discretionary compensation costs and effective income tax rates 
see note  significant accounting policies  of the notes to the financial statements for descriptions of critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues 
generally we recognize revenues as we perform services for our clients on a time and materials or percentage of completion basis  depending upon the contract with the client 
periodically we review ongoing engagements to reassess our estimates to complete and estimates of realizability 
if we determine that the estimated revenue has changed on a given engagement  we record the cumulative effect of the change in the period in which it becomes known 
circumstances that could cause our estimated revenue to change include changes in estimates of time required to complete an engagement  changes in engagement staffing mix  changes in client participation in the engagement  and other factors 
in addition  we have an insignificant number of engagements for which revenue is not recognized as we perform services  but as transaction fees are earned or contingencies  such as cost savings  are resolved 
valuation of accounts receivable 
periodically we review accounts receivable to reassess our estimates of collectibility 
we provide valuation reserves for bad debts based on specific identification of likely and probable losses 
in addition  we provide valuation reserves for estimates of aged receivables that may be written off  based upon historical experience 
these valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the quality of our collection efforts 
valuation of goodwill 
effective july   the company early adopted the new accounting principle related to goodwill  statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a consequence  we recognized a transitional impairment loss of million  net of tax  per share as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this transitional impairment loss resulted from the change in method of measuring impairments from undiscounted cash flows to discounted cash flows 
we review goodwill for impairment at least once annually and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment would be indicated if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit 
factors which we consider in determining if an impairment may have incurred are significant underperformance of the business relative to historical or forecasted results  and other significant factors negatively affecting our client base  our staff  significant engagements  or the industries and markets we serve 
estimates of discretionary compensation costs and effective income tax rates 
discretionary compensation costs and income tax expense are two of the more significant expense categories that are highly dependent upon management estimates and judgments  particularly at each interim reporting date 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
discretionary compensation costs are determined once a year after the company s annual operating results are finalized  thus  estimates are subject to change 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently became available as we prepared our corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
components of our statements of operations revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from professional service activities 
revenues include all amounts that are billed or billable to clients 
unbilled revenues represents revenues for services performed that have not been billed 
maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the terms of the agreement 
when our consulting engagements have multiple elements  each element is separately evaluated and revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
generally we enter into contracts with our clients prior to the time work on a project begins 
these contracts contain varying terms and conditions 
these contracts generally provide that they can be terminated without significant advance notice or penalty 
generally  in the event that a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay us for services performed and expenses incurred by us through the date of termination 
professional compensation 
competition for consulting professionals  particularly information technology professionals with the advanced technology skills necessary to perform the services we offer  has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation  a trend we expect to diminish as a result of the current downturn in economic conditions 
as with other professional service firms  we must adequately anticipate wage increases 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to keep our consultants highly utilized on revenue generating activities  and to hire and retain talented people 
other direct contract expenses 
other direct contract expenses include costs directly attributable to client engagements 
these costs include items such as computer hardware and software  travel expenses for professional personnel  and costs associated with subcontractors 
other costs of service 
other costs of service primarily consist of the costs attributable to the support and maintenance of the professional staff  bad debt expense relating to accounts receivables  as well as other indirect costs attributable to serving our client base 
these costs include occupancy costs related to office space utilized by professional staff  the costs of training and recruiting professional staff  and costs associated with professional support personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses such as sales and marketing  costs for information systems  finance and accounting  human resources  sales commissions  amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles  and other expenses related to managing and growing our business 
prior to the separation  most of these activities were provided to us by kpmg llp 
our historical financial statements reflect costs determined on a basis consistent with the original outsourcing agreement entered into at the time of the separation 
the company and kpmg llp entered into a transition services agreement effective february   whereby we no longer receive and do not incur the cost of services related to the coordination and management of a multidisciplinary professional services organization  as such services are not required for us to operate our business as an independent company 
for fiscal  these costs included allocations for international and us partnership level management structure in the amount of million  international and firmwide partnership meetings in the amount of million and support of the kpmg foundation  in the amount of million 
special payment to managing directors 
the terms of our separation from kpmg llp provided that  for the period from january  through june   during which period none of our outstanding common stock was held by outside investors  the profits of kpmg llp and our company were allocated among the partners of kpmg llp and our managing directors on a basis as if the entities had been combined through june  subsequent to june   there has been no further sharing of profits by kpmg llp and our company 
under this arrangement  the special payment made to our managing directors  who were formerly partners in kpmg llp  were paid by our company 
the amount attributed to the five month period ended june  was million and is reflected as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
interest expense and interest income 
through june   interest expense was allocated to us by kpmg llp based on outstanding accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 
effective july   we are no longer allocated interest by kpmg llp 
interest expense is also incurred in connection with debt financing agreements entered into by our company 
interest income is earned on short term investment of available cash balances 
equity in losses of affiliate and loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate 
equity in losses of affiliate and loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate related to qwest cyber 
solutions llc qcs  which was established in june as a joint venture with qwest communications international inc to provide comprehensive internet based application service provider  application hosting and application management services 
qcs incurred cumulative losses in excess of million from its inception to december  and periodically required additional capital to fund its operations and acquire equipment to support the expansion of its business 
we decided not to make any additional capital contributions to qcs and on december   qcs redeemed our ownership interest in the joint venture in exchange for a nominal amount 
accordingly  our investment in qcs of million million on an after tax basis  was written off through a noncash charge to earnings in december income tax expense 
as part of a limited liability partnership  through january   we were not subject to corporate income taxes 
thereafter  we are operating in corporate form and are subject to income taxes 
due to our high level of non deductible travel related and amortization expenses  and unusable foreign tax losses and credits  our effective tax rate exceeds statutory rates 
in addition  the company s effective tax rate is significantly impacted by its level of pre tax earnings 
accordingly  if our pre tax earnings grow and non deductible expenses grow at a slower rate or decrease  our effective tax rate will decrease in the future 
conversion discount on series a preferred stock 
on january   cisco systems  inc cisco purchased million shares of our series a preferred stock for billion 
on september   cisco and kpmg llp agreed that immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering  kpmg llp would purchase million shares of series a preferred stock from cisco for million 
our agreement with cisco required us to repurchase that number of shares of our series a preferred stock that would result in cisco owning of our common stock following the conversion and the initial public offering 
at the initial public offering price of there was a  or million conversion discount  such that the series a preferred stock would convert into our common stock at per share for an equivalent of million shares 
on november   kpmg llp agreed to convert all of the series a preferred stock it agreed to acquire from cisco at the initial public offering price without any conversion discount 
thus  the net amount of the beneficial conversion feature after deducting the amount of the conversion discount foregone by kpmg llp was million 
the intrinsic value ie  the beneficial conversion feature ascribable to the series a preferred stock as a result of the discounted conversion price was reflected as a preferred dividend and a reduction of net income available to common stockholders as of the date of the initial public offering 
results of operations overview the year ended june  was a challenging year as many clients reduced spending on technology consulting and systems integration services 
as a result  we have seen a decline in our revenues in fiscal we have responded to these business conditions by carefully balancing our resources with engagement staffing requirements  eliminating excess capacity through workforce reductions and aggressively reducing discretionary costs to lower the cost of operations and maintain profit margins 
after deducting an million after tax per share charge representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  the company realized a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share for the year ended june  compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share for the year ended june  included in results for fiscal were a million million net of tax charge consisting of equity losses of affiliate and loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate related to the company s investment in qcs  a million preferred stock conversion discount  and million of preferred stock dividends 
income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  from  million in the year ended june   to  million in the year ended june  this overall decrease is primarily attributable to a slower economy  which significantly impacted the financial services and high technology businesses with year over year declines of and  respectively 
public services remained strong with growth of and international revenue also grew by  which is largely due to the acquisitions of the australia and southeast asia consulting practices 
the company expects this period of economic uncertainty may continue to impact revenue growth through calendar  with the most significant impact being in the high technology and communications and content groups 
however  this is expected to be more than offset by the addition of revenues from recent acquisitions 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues improved slightly to from for the years ended june  and  respectively 
despite the decrease in revenue discussed above  the company was able to maintain its gross margin percentage as a result of its continued focus on expense control 
in dollar terms  gross margin decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the decrease in gross margin was due to a decline in revenue of million described above  offset by 
a net decrease in professional compensation of million  or  to million compared to  million in the prior year 
this decrease was predominantly due to the company s reduction in workforce actions  taken in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal overall the company s average billable headcount has declined from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal additionally  incentive compensation accruals were also lower as a result of the decrease in company earnings 

a net decrease in other direct contract expenses of million  or  to million  representing of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue in the prior year 
the decline as a percentage of revenues is a direct result of the company s efforts to limit the use of subcontractors whenever possible  utilizing existing resources  and reduced travel related expenses 

during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax primarily to write down equity investments by million and software licenses held for sale by million 
these charges eliminated the company s exposure to loss related to equity investments and software licenses held for sale 
the company s impairment charge of million million after tax in fiscal related to software licenses held for sale 

a net decrease in other costs of service of million  or  to million from million  was primarily due to a decrease in bad debts expense of million  reduced training costs of million  tighter controls on discretionary expenses  and reduced headcount 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended june  this reflects a decrease of million  or  from million  which is primarily due to lower levels of practice development expenses and a decrease in amortization of intangibles expense of million as a result of the company electing to early adopt sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated goodwill amortization 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  from million during fiscal to million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to the company s increase in short term investments due to an increase of million in its cash and cash equivalents position to million at june  from million at june  interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million to million for the year ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease was due to a repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during fiscal  resulting from the use of proceeds from our initial public offering  and improvements made in our management of client billings and collections 
this improvement is evidenced by the further reduction in our days sales outstanding from days at june  to days at june  loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate  equity in losses of affiliate 
for the year ended june   loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate and equity losses of affiliate of million related primarily to the redemption of our equity investment in qcs in december income tax expense 
for the year ended june   the company earned income before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million and provided income taxes of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
this rate was impacted by the non deductibility of losses incurred by certain international operations as well as non deductible impairment losses relating to equity investments 
for the year ended june   the company earned income before taxes of million and provided income taxes of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
this rate was significantly impacted by the non deductibility of the loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate coupled with non deductible losses in certain international operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company elected to early adopt sfas no 
as of july  this standard eliminates goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires an assessment for goodwill impairment upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
as a result of adoption of this standard  the company did not amortize goodwill during the year ended june   and incurred a non cash transitional impairment charge of million  net of tax 
this transitional impairment charge is a result of the change in accounting principles to measuring impairments on a discounted versus an undiscounted cash flow basis 
preferred stock dividends 
series a preferred stock dividends totaling million were recorded in the year ended june  after december   the company was no longer required to pay dividends on our series a preferred stock because it was redeemed and converted in connection with our initial public offering 
preferred stock conversion discount 
our series a preferred stock contained a beneficial conversion feature whereby the preferred stock could convert into common stock at a rate of between and of the initial public offering price 
based upon an initial public offering price of per share  the net amount of this one time non cash beneficial conversion feature was million 
net income loss applicable to common stockholders 
for the year ended june   the company incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share 
for the year ended june   the company incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share 
both periods results were impacted by significant one time or nonrecurring charges  as described above 
historical year ended june  compared to pro forma year ended june  prior to our separation and incorporation  our income before partner distributions and benefits was the best measure for assessing our historical financial performance 
through january   we operated as part of a partnership  and payments to our consulting partners were accounted for as distributions of partners capital rather than as compensation expense 
as a result  through january   our historical professional compensation expense does not reflect the professional compensation costs we incurred for partners  including payments for services rendered or benefits paid 
in addition  as a partnership  we were not subject to income taxes  as such taxes were the responsibility of the individual partners 
the following table sets forth certain financial information on a historical basis for the year ended june  and a pro forma basis for the year ended june  the adjustments made to fiscal historical results are reflected in the pro forma columns and include adjustments to managing directors compensation  income taxes  and other items as described in the accompanying notes to the pro forma consolidated statements of operations  as if the separation transaction had occurred on july  fiscal historical historical consolidated pro forma combined five months consolidated historical seven months ended year ended consolidated ended june  pro forma june  year ended january  adjustments a june  in thousands in thousands  except share and per share amounts revenues     professional compensation      other direct contract expenses     impairment charge    other costs of service      gross margin      selling  general and administrative expenses      special payment to managing directors   operating income      interest expense     interest income    gain on sale of assets  equity in losses of affiliate and loss on redemption of equity interest in affiliate     minority interests income before partner distributions and benefits

the pro forma financial information for fiscal does not assume the completion of the company s initial public offering  which closed on february  these notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated combined financial statements and notes thereto  included in this form k 
adjustment to reflect partner compensation and benefit costs that the company would have incurred for our managing directors under the terms of the new compensation plan  which was adopted and implemented effective july   had the new plan been in place during the historical periods 
adjustment to reflect the increase in partner accrued vacation pay for the periods preceding our company s separation from kpmg llp 
adjustment to reflect changes to our employee professional and administrative pension plan 
following the separation from kpmg llp on january   our employees no longer participate in the kpmg llp pension plan 
the adjustments to eliminate costs under the employee pension plan were based on the actual amounts allocated to us by kpmg llp during the pro forma periods 
kpmg llp historically allocated costs incurred in the coordination and management of a multidisciplinary professional services organization to each of its functional business units 
for the period from january  until june   we received these services pursuant to the original outsourcing agreement 
certain services provided pursuant to the original outsourcing agreement were not necessary for us to operate our business as an independent company  since they were duplicative or were performed by us internally 
consequently  these services were no longer charged to us effective july  these costs primarily relate to services provided by the executive management teams previously responsible for the consulting business of kpmg llp and kpmg international 
since we operate in corporate form  our existing executive management team will oversee our domestic and international operations 
the costs related to our executive management are reflected in the historical financial statements for non partner costs and are included in pro forma adjustment for managing directors 
the pro forma effect of the elimination of those costs for the year ended june  pursuant to the transition services agreement is as follows in thousands year ended june  international and us partnership level management structure  international and firmwide partnership meetings  support of the kpmg foundation  total  reflects an adjustment to eliminate the special payment to managing directors 
the special payment represents a payment to our managing directors that was determined based on an allocation of the profits of kpmg llp and our company among the partners of kpmg llp and our managing directors  as if the entities had been combined through june  the amounts paid by us to our managing directors in excess of the compensation they earned as managing directors of our company represents the amount classified as a special payment in our statement of operations 
absent this arrangement with kpmg llp  our managing directors would not have received this additional payment 
reflects an adjustment for an estimated income tax provision as if we had operated as a corporation  including tax benefits of certain losses  at a pro forma effective tax rate of for the year ended june  due to our non deductible goodwill amortization and our high level of non deductible travel related expenses  our effective tax rate is impacted to a great extent by our level of earnings 
if our earnings grow and non deductible expenses and goodwill amortization grow at a lesser rate or decrease  our effective tax rate will decrease in the future

revenues increased million  or  from  million for the year ended june  to  million for the year ended june  this overall increase was primarily attributable to an increase in us client service hours billed due to growth in several groups  including public services  high technology and communications and content  as well as continued growth from international operations acquired during fiscal this growth was partially due to joint marketing relationships with alliance partners  growth in next generation operations support systems business support systems offerings  business to business internet related services  and growth from key accounts 
in addition  international revenue grew to million due to acquisitions and organic growth within these operations 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended june   which increased from on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to i costs attributable to the support and maintenance related to professional staff such as occupancy  training  recruiting and professional support personnel costs increased at a slower rate than the overall growth in the business and ii the recording of certain one time non cash charges relating to compensatory common stock issuances and settlement of pension obligations to certain managing directors during fiscal in dollar terms  gross margin increased by million  or  from million on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  the increase in dollar terms was due to the million increase in revenues described above  partially offset by cost increases due to the following 
a net increase in professional compensation of million  or  from  million on a pro forma basis to  million  primarily due to a million increase in professional staff compensation and benefits due to higher wages and benefits for new and existing staff and an increase of million in accruals for incentive compensation 
in april  the company recorded a million charge for severance and termination benefits related to a reduction in workforce 
the reduction in workforce affected approximately employees and was the result of balancing the company s workforce with market demand for certain types of services 
these increases were partially offset by a one time charge of million recorded in fiscal relating to compensatory common stock issuances and settlement of pension obligations to certain managing directors 

an increase in other direct contract expenses of million  or  from million of revenue to million of revenue  due to increased use of subcontractors and higher travel and lodging expenses incurred by professional staff to travel to client sites

an increase in other costs of service of million  or  from million on a pro forma basis to million due to overall growth in the business during fiscal and a million increase in provisions for doubtful accounts due to losses incurred and increased reserves during the second half of fiscal as a result of the downturn in economic conditions  particularly in the financial services industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended june  this reflects an increase of million  or  from million on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million related to new business development costs as a result of higher levels of commissions earned on a higher revenue base and additional sales personnel  as well as higher marketing costs

interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million to million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease was due to decreased outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility for the year ended june  resulting from the use of proceeds from the company s initial public offering and improvements made in the management of client billings and collections  as evidenced by the reduction in days sales outstanding  from days at june  to days at june  interest expense for the year ended june  consisted primarily of interest incurred by kpmg llp and allocated to the company

quarterly summarized financial information the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the last eight quarters on a historical basis 
in management s opinion  the quarterly information contains all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to fairly present such information 
as a professional services organization  the company anticipates and responds to service demands from its clients 
accordingly  the company has limited control over the timing and circumstances under which its services are provided 
typically  client service hours are adversely affected during the first half of the fiscal year due to the larger number of vacation days and holidays during this period 
therefore  the company can experience variability in its operating results from quarter to quarter 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through cash generated from operations 
while the company expects the current economic downturn may continue to impact revenue growth for at least another six months  we continue to actively manage client billings and collections and maintain tight controls over discretionary expenses 
additionally  the company has borrowing arrangements available including a revolving credit facility with no outstanding balance at june  not to exceed million  as well as a receivables purchase agreement with no outstanding balance at june  not to exceed million 
the revolving credit facility expires on may  and includes affirmative  negative and financial covenants  including  among others  covenants restricting the company s ability to incur liens and indebtedness  purchase the company s securities  and pay dividends and requiring the company to maintain a minimum level of net worth million as of june   maintain fixed charge coverage of at least to as defined and maintain a leverage ratio not to exceed to as defined 
we are in compliance with the financial ratios  covenants and other restrictions imposed by this credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and a default i upon the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of or more of the company s common stock  or ii if within a period of six calendar months  a majority of the officers of the company s executive committee cease to serve on its executive committee  and their terminations or departures materially affect the company s business 
the receivables purchase agreement contains covenants that are consistent with the company s revolving credit facility  cross defaults to the revolving credit facility and permits sales of accounts receivable through may   subject to annual renewal 
the accounts receivable purchase agreement is accounted for as a financing  accordingly  it is not an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is determined  at the company s option  based on the prime rate or the libor rate plus a margin ranging from to 
there are also commitment fees ranging from to for the revolving credit 
the commitment fees vary based on the company s leverage ratio at quarter end 
the credit facility agreement restricts the company s ability to pay dividends  incur additional indebtedness and purchase capital equipment 
the credit facility agreement also requires the company to maintain certain levels of fixed charge coverage and net worth  while limiting its leverage ratio to certain levels 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at june  when compared with million at june  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to million of cash provided by operating activities offset by million of cash used in investing activities and by million of cash used in financing activities 
cash provided by operating activities during the year ended june  was million  principally due to cash operating results of million and collections of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues of million and million  respectively  primarily offset by decreases in accrued payroll and related liabilities of million 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended june  was million  principally due to million of property and equipment purchases  million of intangible assets purchased or developed internally  and million paid for businesses acquired 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  was million principally  due to the purchase of million treasury shares for million in connection with the company s share repurchase program and the repayment of notes payable of million offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock  primarily relating to the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in connection with acquisitions and the hiring of professionals and staff members of various andersen business consulting practices  the company has paid million in cash subsequent to june  on august  the company entered into an additional million revolving credit facility for the purpose of funding the acquisition of kpmg consulting ag 
this facility matures on december  borrowings bear interest at either the prime rate  the libor rate plus a margin ranging from to or money market rates the option of which is determinable by the company 
the facility contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants that are consistent with the company s other revolving credit facility described above 
on august  the company borrowed million under the new facility and million under the existing receivables purchase agreement to acquire kpmg consulting ag 
the company intends to replace the new facility with other financing prior to december  the credit facility provides that  upon receipt of proceeds by the company from certain dispositions of assets or issuances of equity or debt securities  the revolving credit commitments will automatically be reduced by certain amounts in the case of such dispositions  or by the amount of proceeds received in the case of an issuance of securities  and the company is required to repay amounts due that exceed the reduced credit commitments 
on august   the company expanded its yen denominated line of credit facility to an aggregated principle balance not to exceed billion yen approximately 
borrowings under the facility accrue interest at tibor plus and are used to finance working capital for the company s japan operations 
there are no covenants under the facility and it matures on august the company has future aggregate minimum lease payments under operating leases for the years ending june in amounts as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
additionally  the company expects to spend million to million on one time re branding efforts during the first half of fiscal under the transition services agreement with kpmg llp which terminates no later than february  for non technology services and february  for technology related services  the company contracted to receive certain infrastructure support services from kpmg llp until the company completes the build out of its own infrastructure 
if the company terminates services prior to the end of the term for such services  the company may be obligated to pay kpmg llp termination costs  as defined in the transition services agreement  incurred as a result of kpmg llp winding down and terminating such services 
kpmg llp and the company have agreed that during the term of the transition services agreement the parties will work together to minimize any termination costs including transitioning personnel and contracts from kpmg llp to our company  and our company will wind down its receipt of services from kpmg llp and develop its own internal infrastructure and support capabilities or seek third party providers of such services 
the company continues to receive from kpmg llp services relating to information technology such as telecommunications and user services  financial systems  human resources systems  occupancy and office support services in facilities used by both the company and kpmg llp  and financing of capital assets used in the provisioning of transition services 
the company has given notice to kpmg llp of its intent to terminate certain services in fiscal for which the amount of termination costs have either not been determined by kpmg llp or not agreed upon by the parties 
in july  the company paid kpmg llp million representing the unamortized costs of leasehold improvements purchased by kpmg llp and used exclusively by the company 
based on information currently available  the company anticipates paying kpmg llp approximately million to million for the sale and transfer of additional capital assets such as computer equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements currently used by the company through the transition services agreement for which usage charges are included in the monthly costs under the agreement 
until the company takes ownership of these capital assets  the transition services agreement provides an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
the amount of termination costs that the company will pay to kpmg llp depends upon the timing of service terminations  the ability of the parties to work together to minimize the costs  and the amount of payments required under existing contracts with third parties for services provided to the company by kpmg llp and which can continue to be obtained directly by the company thereafter 
accordingly  the amount of termination costs that the company will pay to kpmg llp in the future cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company believes that the amount of termination costs yet to be assessed will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows  or liquidity 
whether such amounts could have a material effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year cannot be determined at this time 
the company believes that the cash provided from operations  borrowings available under the various existing credit facilities  and existing cash and cash equivalents along with additional financing to be completed prior to december  should be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months

these risks  which include interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk  arise in the normal course of business rather than from trading activities 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our bank credit facilities carries variable interest rates
