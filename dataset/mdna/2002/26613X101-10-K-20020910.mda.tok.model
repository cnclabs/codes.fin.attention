item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
all references to years are to our fiscal years  which end on june overview based on worldwide revenue  we are one of the largest photomask manufacturers in the world 
we sell our products to over customers and customer sites in over different countries 
essentially all of our sales are to customers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
we manufacture a broad range of photomasks based on customer supplied design data 
we also manufacture pellicles  one of the principal components of photomasks  which protect the photomask from particle contamination  primarily for internal consumption 
we operate globally with established manufacturing facilities in north america  europe and asia 
we believe that over the long term the market for photomasks in the semiconductor manufacturing process will increase due to the following trends proliferation of semiconductor applications  customization of semiconductor designs  increasing semiconductor device complexity  decreasing size of semiconductor designs  and shorter product lifecycles 
these trends have increased the importance of photomask technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
in part as a result of these trends  our annual revenue increased an average annual compounded rate of percent from to in  our revenue decreased percent  from million in to million 
in  our revenues continued to be negatively impacted by the downturn in the global semiconductor market  which began in the second half of fiscal this downturn was principally driven by decreased demand in many of the major end user markets of the electronics industry 
although our customers design activities continued  in reaction to declining demand they scaled back tape outs ie  photomask orders for some new chip designs until business conditions improve 
the downturn became even more pronounced during the first half of fiscal as our customers  in reaction to continued soft demand and growing inventory levels began taking more dramatic steps to contain costs 
during  we derived cost savings and improved productivity from the reorganization of our manufacturing and technical organizations which commenced during the fourth quarter of in response to a sustained decline of demand in trailing edge photomasks  we decommissioned and abandoned a number of trailing edge manufacturing lines throughout the world  and reduced our global workforce by percent  over the course of and photomask manufacturing operations are capital intensive 
accordingly  at a given threshold of manufacturing capacity  a high proportion of our operating costs are fixed and remain relatively constant as sales volume increases or decreases 
to the extent that we have under utilized production capacity  operating profit increases or decreases significantly as sales volume increases or decreases 
in and  our operating costs increased as we added capacity to position ourselves for future growth  but the utilization improved and our gross margin as a percentage of revenue rose percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
in  our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points as our revenue fell percent and our costs remained relatively stable 
the current environment in the semiconductor industry is like no other in the past 
our customers high level of uncertainty  combined with our short two week backlog  creates too great a challenge to provide reliable guidance beyond a single quarter 
in light of the volatility within our customer base  we head into fiscal with a broad range of revenue scenarios 
we continue to explore operating and administrative efficiencies to improve operating margins in results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial information expressed as a percentage of revenue  net for the periods indicated 
year ended june  revenue  net cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense special charges operating profit loss gain loss on warrants  net gain on sale of assets other expense income  net income before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for benefit from income taxes income before minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle minority interest in income of joint ventures income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue  net 
revenue  net decreased percent from million in to million in demand for advanced photomasks  those with design technology of micron and below  grew from percent to percent of our revenue  for and  respectively 
total unit volume demand declined percent primarily as a result of our customers response to the significant downturn in the semiconductor industry during the year 
average selling prices decreased percent as a result of traditional product lifecycle declines in selling prices of certain technologies and customer initiated pressures and competitive pressures 
additionally our customers that maintain internal photomask operations reduced outsourcing during the year  reducing demand for higher priced leading edge products 
from to  revenue  net produced in north america decreased from million to million because of the decrease in average selling price and unit volumes 
revenue  net produced in europe decreased from million to million because of the decrease in average selling price and unit volumes 
revenue  net produced in asia increased from million to million due primarily to an increase in average selling price and unit volumes 
increased unit volume in asia was a result of improved local demand combined with production transferred from north america and europe 
costs of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  depreciation and overhead 
cost of goods sold decreased percent from million in to million in the decrease resulted primarily from decreased production volumes  benefits realized from our cost reduction programs and the overall efficiencies gained through the global reorganization of our manufacturing organization implemented in the quarter ended june  these reductions were partially offset by increased depreciation expense resulting from new investments in advanced production capabilities 
gross profit decreased from million for to million for as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased from percent in to percent in primarily as a result of lower revenue 
unless revenue increases in the short term  gross margin rates will continue to be under pressure due to the effect of our fixed costs  however  this should be partially offset by the effect of ongoing cost reduction programs 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries of sales and administrative personnel  marketing expense  general and administrative expense and product distribution expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased percent from million for to million for this was primarily a result of the cost reduction programs implemented in the quarter ended june  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue  net increased from percent for to percent for as a result of lower revenues partially offset by the benefits realized from the cost reduction programs 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee costs  cost of material consumed  depreciation  engineering related costs and our share of costs of the rtc 
research and development expense decreased percent from million for to million for the decrease was primarily as a result of synergies realized due to the reorganization of our technical group 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue  net increased from percent for to percent for the increase was due primarily to lower revenues 
we continue to focus on research and development in all of our advanced production facilities  in the rtc and in our eda company 
this focus will expand in the future to the amtc and our alliance with schott 
the current rtc agreement expires in december  but can be renewed at the discretion of the members 
we believe that  because of our continued focus on research and development  we will be able to help meet the future technology needs of the semiconductor industry for advanced photomasks 
gain loss on warrants  net 
during  we realized losses of million upon the exercise of all remaining warrants of a strategic partner and sale of the underlying securities 
gain on sale of assets 
in march  we sold all of our photoblank manufacturing assets located in poughkeepsie  new york  to schott 
we have also entered into a supply agreement with schott for a significant portion of our future purchases of photoblanks 
the total proceeds of million were allocated million to the assets sold and million to the supply agreement 
the amount allocated to the supply agreement was determined based on the projected cash flows that will be generated by the supply agreement  discounted to present value 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the value of the supply agreement will be amortized ratably as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the term of the agreement 
the supply agreement also allows us to be paid additional amounts totaling million if specified purchase levels are achieved by march  these additional amounts will be amortized as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the term of the supply agreement 
special charges 
in the quarter ended march   we recorded pre tax special charges totaling million related to cost reduction programs and acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
the cost reduction programs and related special charges consisted of the following asset abandonments relating primarily to trailing edge production equipment that was removed from service 
employee severance expenses relating to workforce reductions in the united states and europe 
of the employees severed  employees left our company by march  the employee severances were primarily manufacturing positions and some administrative personnel 
in connection with the acquisition of the assets of bindkey in march  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased ipr d 
the amount attributed to ipr d was expensed at the date of acquisition as the projects had not reached technological feasibility nor had any alternative future use 
a summary of the special charges is shown below in millions asset impairments employee severance ipr d total fiscal charges utilized in fiscal remaining liability at june  we expect the remaining million accrued liability to be utilized in fiscal no additional expenditures relating to these cost reduction programs are expected 
we expect to realize benefits of approximately million over the next year as a result of the asset impairments and employee reductions 
our management continues to monitor the business climate in general and our industry in particular to determine the usefulness of our assets and will  if necessary  incur additional charges in to enhance the economic viability of our company 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net includes interest income and expense  foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains and losses 
other expense income  net was million in and million in the change was caused by a decrease in interest income of million  due to substantially lower interest rates  partially offset by favorable decreases in net foreign exchange losses of million 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our tax expense is based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which we operate 
certain of our operations in asia are subject to various tax holidays which expire in whole or in part during fiscal years through certain tax holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met 
our effective tax rate for was a tax benefit of percent versus a tax expense of percent for our effective tax rate varied from the prior year because of shifts in the geographic distribution of earnings and losses between high and low tax rate countries partially due to the special charges recorded in the united states 
additionally  the tax rate was impacted by an adjustment to release the previously provided valuation allowance against certain capital losses  which became realizable upon recognition of the capital gain on the sale of our photoblank manufacturing assets 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate because a substantial portion of our asian manufacturing operations in korea  china  taiwan and singapore operate at a reduced tax rate or free of tax under various tax holidays which expire in whole or in part during fiscal years through during  we recorded deferred income tax benefits associated with our operating loss for the year 
recent changes in us income tax laws allow substantially all of the deferred income tax benefits from these losses to be realized through tax refunds under special carryback rules available during fiscal minority interest in income of joint ventures 
the minority interest impact of our joint venture manufacturing facilities was million in compared to million in  reflecting the partners share of income from our joint ventures  which currently include our shanghai  china and hsinchu  taiwan operations 
the increase was primarily the result of increased profitability in our shanghai  china joint venture 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue  net 
revenue  net increased percent from million in to million in the overall annual increase primarily occurred because average selling price increased approximately percent and unit volume increased approximately percent from year to from to  revenue  net produced in north america increased from million to million because of the increase in average selling price and unit volumes 
revenue  net produced in europe increased from million to million because our altis acquisition was online for the entire year and the increased average selling price and unit volumes 
revenue  net produced in asia increased from million to million because our facility in singapore was online for a majority of the year and our increased production in our joint ventures in taiwan and shanghai 
during  we experienced two radically different business climates in which we operated 
for the first two quarters of  we experienced percent revenue growth versus the previous year 
in the third quarter of  one of the steepest drops on record in the global semiconductor market  principally driven by a drop in demand of many of the major end use markets of the electronics industry  began to affect us as customers scaled back purchases 
the downturn became even more pronounced in the fourth quarter of and started to affect orders for advanced photomasks 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent from million in to million in the increase resulted primarily from higher costs associated with increased manufacturing capacity offset in part by cost containment initiatives initiated in the quarter ended june  as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from percent in to percent in the percentage of sales decrease was primarily due to increased production volumes as a result of increased sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased from percent in to percent in in addition  selling  general and administrative expense increased percent from million in to million in as a result of new facilities coming completely on line  initiatives and incentive compensation expense and the completion and implementation of new information systems 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased percent from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increased investment in research and development throughout the company  particularly through our participation in the rtc 
the current rtc agreement expires in december  but can be renewed at the discretion of the members 
in  we entered into technology advancement projects with infineon technologies and xilinx 
special charges 
in  we recorded pre tax special charges totaling million related to cost reduction programs 
the pre tax special charge recorded in the quarter ended march  was million and the special charge recorded in the quarter ended june  was million 
accrued severance of million was the only liability remaining at june  and it was completely paid out by august the cost reduction programs and related special charges consisted of the following building costs and asset write downs of million related to the closing of our gresham  oregon facility 
we determined that our estimated recoverable value was million and we have reclassified this amount to assets held for sale 
in  we disposed of approximately million of the assets at its estimated recoverable value 
we continue to hold the building and remaining assets for sale and evaluate all proposals 
asset write downs of million related primarily to trailing edge production equipment and leasehold improvements that were removed from service and disposed of or are being held for sale 
the assets had an estimated salvage value of approximately million which was reclassified to assets held for sale 
we expect to complete the disposal of the remaining equipment held for sale during fiscal employee severance expenses of million related to the closure and sale of our hamilton  scotland facility and workforce reductions in the united states related to the decommissioning of trailing edge production lines 
approximately percent of the terminated employees left our company by june  the accrued severance was completely paid out during july and august the employee terminations were primarily manufacturing positions 
gain loss on warrants  net 
during  we recognized realized and unrealized gains of million on warrants 
as of june   we held  vested warrants with a market value of million 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net includes interest income and expense  foreign currency transaction and remeasurement gains and losses 
other expense income  net was million in and million in the change was caused by increased interest income due to increased cash balances  partially offset by smaller interest expense as a result of the refinancing of long term debt completed in the quarter ended september  provision for benefit from income taxes 
our tax expense is based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which we operate 
our effective tax rate decreased percent from percent for to percent for primarily due to the tax benefit recognized on the sale of our hamilton  scotland facility 
our effective tax rate is lower than the maximum us statutory rate primarily because certain of our operations in asia are subject to government granted tax exemptions 
minority interest in income of joint ventures 
the minority interest impact of our joint venture manufacturing facilities was million in compared to million in  reflecting the partners share of income from our joint ventures  which currently include our shanghai  china and hsinchu  taiwan operations 
the million change was the result of increased profitability of these operations 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital was million as of june  and million at june  the decrease in working capital was due principally to a decrease in revenue resulting in lower accounts receivable reflecting the continued downturn of the semiconductor industry  a reduction of inventories primarily as a result of the sale of our photoblank manufacturing assets and a reduction of deferred income taxes 
cash and cash equivalents were million as of june  and million as of june  our principal source of cash is from our operating activities  which generated million in and million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of lower net income as adjusted for non cash income and expenses and lower customer prepayments in compared to we have agreed to purchase a significant portion of our photoblank requirements from schott over the term of the supply agreement 
additionally  we have committed to pay infineon million for their year photomask supply agreement 
cash used in investing activities  consisting of capital expenditures  proceeds from the sale of stock and investments and payments for acquisitions and investments  was million in and million in management expects capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
we will fund a capital contribution to the bac  of million euro during the second quarter of we have equipment purchase commitments of approximately million  approximately million of which is payable in and and up to million of which is expected to be payable in capital expenditures have been and will be used primarily to advance our technical capability 
we also guarantee certain lease obligations of the rtc with future minimum lease payments of approximately million as of june  additionally  we have guaranteed percent of the million euro short term debt of the bac 
in addition  we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into other joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
cash provided from financing activities was million in and million in net short term borrowings increased million in additionally  our employees purchased million of common stock under our employee plans 
at june   we had a credit agreement with dupont  which was comprised of two separate facilities for million each 
the first facility  which bore an interest rate of libor plus percent per annum expired in september the second facility was repaid and terminated in july in july  we publicly sold equity and debt securities with aggregate net proceeds to us of million 
a portion of the proceeds was used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings from dupont  as discussed above  and we are using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
the first transaction was the sale of million shares of our common stock of which million shares represented original issuance and million shares represented the sale of outstanding shares owned by dupont 
the stock was offered to the public at per share with gross proceeds of million  offering costs of million  and net proceeds of million 
our portion of the offering proceeds was million for the original issuance 
we also sold million principal amount of subordinated convertible notes with net proceeds of million 
the notes are due in july  with no stated interest  are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  are unconditionally guaranteed by dupont and have no optional redemption by us 
in the event of a fundamental change in our company  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to redeem  in cash  any or all of such holder s notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount to be redeemed 
a fundamental change generally is any transaction in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to pay the redemption price for all the notes tendered by the holders  although dupont would be required to pay the redemption price under its guarantee 
in that case  our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  and may constitute a default under the terms of other indebtedness that we may enter into from time to time 
our ongoing cash requirements will be for capital expenditures  acquisitions  research and development and working capital 
management believes that cash on hand and any cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  based on our current operating plans  we may require external financing from time to time to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing will be available if our capital requirements exceed cash flow from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing required to fund our capital needs on reasonable terms  or at all 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of june  in millions payments due by period total fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our other commercial commitments as of june  in millions amount of commitment expiration by period total fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond guarantees other commercial commitments total commercial commitments we are also committed to fund percent of the operating cash requirements of the rtc through december additionally  we are committed to fund percent of the operating cash requirements of the amtc and the bac through june critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when both title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain 
discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue during the period they are earned by the customer 
provision is made for an estimate of product returns based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction in revenue 
customarily  our shipping terms are fob shipping point  however  our final terms depend upon the negotiations with our customers 
estimating allowances  specifically sales returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for excess and obsolete inventory the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we consider trends of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions on future demands and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required 
valuation of intangible and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  other long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
accounting for income taxes we are required to consider our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate in computing our effective income tax rate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
further  the actual annual amount of taxable income in each tax jurisdiction may differ from the estimates we used to compute the effective tax rate during our first  second and third quarters 
additionally  we evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is not more likely than not 
our income tax provision in the consolidated income statement is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
this process is complex and involves significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets consolidation the consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of dupont photomasks  inc and our controlled and wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
entities that are not controlled but on which we can significantly influence  are recorded under the equity method of accounting 
other matters in the ordinary course of business  we engage in transactions with related parties including dupont  the rtc and certain of our non united states employees 
transactions with dupont relate primarily to agreements entered into in for transitional services 
additionally  approximately million  million and million of our revenue in china for the years ended june   and  respectively  was transacted through a dupont subsidiary in order to facilitate the collection of receivables 
we conduct a portion of our research and development projects by funding our proportionate share of the research efforts of the rtc joint venture 
in the management of this joint venture  we enter into certain transactions in order to obtain cost benefits for the joint venture 
additionally  we have receivables from certain of our non united states employees related primarily to housing and automobile loans 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 discontinues amortization of acquired goodwill and instead requires annual impairment testing 
separable intangible assets will be amortized over their useful economic lives and tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life will not be amortized until the life of the asset is determined to be finite 
for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired prior to july   goodwill will continue to be amortized until adoption of sfas no 
at which time amortization will cease and a transitional goodwill impairment test will be performed 
any impairment charges resulting from the initial application of the new rules will be classified as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we have adopted sfas as of july  it had no impact on our results of operations or financial position  and  we believe it will have no impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
supersedes previous guidance for financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
we have adopted sfas as of july  and do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model  based on the model in sfas no 
 for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
we have adopted sfas as of july  and do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds certain guidance for reporting extinguishments of debt and provides guidance to determine if the transactions are part of recurring operations or if they meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that certain lease modifications be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
we have adopted sfas as of july  and do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity must be recognized at fair value in the period the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
nullifies the guidance of the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
 but do not expect that its adoption will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
we will adopt sfas no 
by december  foreign currency exposure 
non us operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative value of currencies and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative value of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  have a material effect on our results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements reflect remeasurement of items denominated in non us currencies to us dollars  our functional currency 
exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur 
we monitor our exchange rate exposure and attempt to reduce such exposure by hedging 
we have entered into forward contracts in currencies of the countries in which we conduct business in order to reduce such exposure 
there can be no assurance that such forward contracts or any other hedging activity will be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
there can be no assurance that such risks will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of june   we had million in non interest bearing convertible notes and approximately million in interest bearing debt of which approximately million was short term debt 
as a result  changes in the interest rate market would change the estimated fair value of our long term debt 
we believe that a percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exposures are primarily due to non us operations which are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative value of currencies and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative value of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  have a material effect on our results of operations 
any exchange rate fluctuations can affect our margins since we may have imbalances between some foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
our financial statements reflect remeasurement of items denominated in non us currencies to us dollars  our functional currency 
exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur 
we monitor our exchange rate exposure and attempt to reduce such exposure by hedging 
we have entered into forward contracts in currencies of the countries in which we conduct business in order to reduce such exposure 
at june   the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding was million with an unrealized loss recorded in the consolidated income statement of million for these instruments may involve elements of credit and market risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
we believe that a ten percent change in exchange rates would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we monitor our positions and the credit quality of counter parties  consisting primarily of major financial institutions  and do not anticipate nonperformance by any counter party  although nonperformance could occur 
there can be no assurance that such forward contracts or any other hedging activity will be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
there can be no assurance that such risks will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations in the future 
financial risk management our international revenues are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
some of our sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring us either to increase our price in the local currency  which could render our product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
our foreign currency hedging program is comprised of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of our foreign exchange risks 
the marketplace for our products dictates that we maintain inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for us due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by us or our competitors of products embodying new technology 
while we maintain valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
as of june   we had outstanding foreign short term debt totaling approximately million 
at june   we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
at june  we had million of subordinated convertible debt outstanding 
the notes are due in july  with no stated interest  are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  are unconditionally guaranteed by dupont and are not callable by us 
in the event of a fundamental change in our company  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to redeem  in cash  any or all of such holder s notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount to be redeemed 
a fundamental change generally is any transaction in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to pay the redemption price for all the notes tendered by the holders  although dupont would be required to pay the redemption price under its guarantee 
in that case  our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  and may constitute a default under the terms of other indebtedness that we may enter into from time to time
