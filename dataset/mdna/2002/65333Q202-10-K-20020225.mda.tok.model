presentation of financial information in  we significantly restructured our operations and focused on a new business direction 
we virtually completed our exit from the business of building and servicing business to business marketplaces and entered the business of providing collaborative software solutions 
in august  we acquired privately held nexprise  inc  a company with an advanced collaborative software solution and an established customer base 
we have reorganized our management team and board of directors and also have taken measures to reduce commitments and operating expenses and conserve cash 
during the company incurred a net charge of million in connection with restructurings and settlements 
all revenues presented are derived from the operations of nexprise  acquired in august in the quarter ended december   nexprise then ventro decided to restructure and shut down its two wholly owned marketplaces  chemdex and promedix 
accordingly  results of continuing operations for nexprise for the periods ended december  exclude the results of operations of chemdex and promedix and the results of those operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
aggregate charges of approximately million were recorded for the year ended december   in connection with restructuring and discontinued operations 
overview nexprise  inc the company  nexprise  us  our or we  formerly known as both ventro corporation and as chemdex corporation  is a provider of collaborative solutions for program management and quote management 
on august  the company purchased privately held nexprise  inc  a provider of collaborative commerce solutions located in santa clara  california 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the cost of the transaction was approximately million  inclusive of liabilities assumed and transaction costs 
additionally  as part of the transaction  nexprise s obligations under existing employee option plans were assumed  which resulted in the issuance of up to million shares  the value of which is included in the million cost 
nexprise expects to incur operating losses on a quarterly basis for at least the next twelve months as we develop and enhance our technology and service offerings 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounting for investments  impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes license revenue using the subscription method 
the subscription method recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of a contract 
revenue is made up primarily of subscriptions of bundled license and post contract support pcs and in some situations include hosting 
the initial and renewal amounts are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of the license during which the services are expected to be provided 
for each arrangement  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all of the criteria are met 

table of contents investments 
the various interests that we have acquired in companies are accounted for under three broad methods consolidation  the equity method and the cost method 
the applicable accounting method is generally determined based on our voting interest in a company 
consolidation 
companies that nexprise directly or indirectly controls are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting 
under this method  a company s accounts are reflected within its consolidated financial statements 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions are eliminated 
equity method 
entities where nexprise can exercise significant influence  but not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
whether or not nexprise exercises significant influence with respect to a company depends on an evaluation of several factors including  among others  representation on the company s board of directors and ownership level  generally interest in the voting securities of the company including voting rights associated with nexprise holdings in common  preferred and other convertible instruments in the company 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the earnings or losses of these companies are included in the equity income loss section of the consolidated statements of operations 
cost method 
companies not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
under this method  nexprise s share of the earnings or losses of these companies is not included in its consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its investments for impairment 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the entities in which the company has invested  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments the company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of its investees 
if these forecasts are not met the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   the company had million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january  in the first half of the company does not believe that any reduction of the goodwill balance at january  is required 
however  based on steps the company has taken to prepare for the adoption of statement  it is possible that a portion of the million goodwill related to the acquisition of nexprise will be impaired using the impairment test required by statement an impairment that is required to be recognized when adopting statement will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first half of during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets 
deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a full valuation reserve related to its substantial deferred tax assets 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  the company may be required to reduce its valuation allowances  resulting in income tax benefits in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for valuation allowance quarterly

nexprise reported  of revenue for the period ended december  this revenue is made up primarily of subscriptions of bundled license and post contract support pcs and in some situations include hosting for the company s collaborative commerce products generated subsequent to our august  acquisition of privately held nexprise  inc subscription revenue generally entails recognizing the value of the customer contract as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
previously  revenues were derived primarily from product sales through the chemdex and promedix marketplaces  which have been presented as discontinued operations 
our revenues may increase in as we recognize a full year of revenue  as existing customers renew and expand their user base and as new customers are brought under contract 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in consists primarily of outsourced hosting services for our customers  amortization of the technology intangible asset acquired in august  personnel and other expenses associated with providing maintenance services  technical support services and royalties payable to third parties whose software is incorporated in the nexprise solution 
cost of revenues in and were related to operations that were discontinued in december the company expects the cost of revenues in absolute dollars to increase in the coming year  but for cost of revenues to decline as a percentage of revenue if revenues increase significantly as the company s infrastructure is leveraged across what is expected to be a larger customer base in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and other expenses associated with developing  updating  and enhancing software 
research and development 
table of contents expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  down approximately million from the approximately million spent during fiscal the decrease was largely driven by reductions in workforce that occurred in april and july of a substantial portion of research and development expenses incurred in and in related to operations that are included in the discontinued operations line items 
the company expects next year s recurring research and development expenses to be substantially less than those incurred in we believe that continued investments in research and development are required to remain competitive 
in process research and development 
the company expensed million of acquired in process research and development as a result of the nexprise acquisition  which closed on august  the company determined the amount of in process research and development through an independent valuation in connection with the allocation of the purchase price 
an additional in process research and development charge may also result from our february  acquisition of infoprise  however  the amount of such a charge  if any  has not yet been determined 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in enterprise sales activities and enterprise account management  as well as travel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  down million from the approximately million expensed during the decrease was driven by reductions in workforce that took place during and reduced spending on marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses in and  related to operations that were discontinued in december  are included in discontinued operations 
the company does not expect sales and marketing expenses to change significantly in the coming year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  fees for professional services and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million  up million from the approximately million spent in the company incurred approximately million in the increase in was driven by incentive payments made in the first two quarters of and reduced cost recoveries from subsidiaries and marketplace investments  the reduced cost recoveries also explain the reduction in as compared to the company expects general and administrative expenses in to be significantly lower than those reported in due to reductions in infrastructure costs and reductions in workforce that took place during settlements  restructurings and other 
during the year ended december   the company took many actions to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs 
the specific actions outlined below include employee and contractor terminations  consolidation of facilities  settlements of various disputes and termination of leases 
the net of these charges was reported as a component of loss from continuing operations 
in the second quarter of  the company announced a restructuring plan in connection with its efforts to improve efficiencies and cut operating costs 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  write offs and accruals with respect to certain assets and commitments  as well as termination of services for the broadlane  marketmile and industria marketplaces 
as a result  the company recorded a net charge of million during the three months ended june  and included a a workforce reduction charge of million  primarily related to the cost of severance and related benefits for the termination of approximately employees  b million of estimated remaining lease payments and the cost recoveries anticipated from subleases related to excess leased facilities and equipment and c a write off of the difference between the net book value of the assets and the anticipated salvage value of excess computer and networking equipment and related software of million 
the company recorded a gain of million in the quarter ended june  for the settlements  net of write downs associated with its marketplace companies broadlane  industria and marketmile 
the gain primarily consisted of receipt of an million two year interest bearing promissory note from broadlane which is guaranteed by tenet healthcare corporation and cash and certain assets from industria  offset by accruals and write downs of receivables from the marketplace companies 

table of contents in the three months ended september  the company recorded million of restructuring charges 
these charges consisted of approximately million of severance and other related costs associated with the ventro employees terminated in connection with the acquisition of nexprise and million of expense  accrued for anticipated reduced cost recoveries related to disposal of excess facilities and equipment  resulting from continued deterioration of the real estate and equipment markets 
in the three months ended december  the company recorded a million gain from restructuring and settlement 
the gain was driven by better than expected settlements related to the termination of excess facilities and equipment leases and the settlement with marketmile

table of contents on the sale of ariba formerly tradex stock 
the company has a net book value of million related to these investments as of december   down from million at december  loss from continuing operations 
as a result of the changes described above  the loss from continuing operations was approximately million in  down million from the loss from continuing operations is expected to decrease significantly in due to reductions we have made in operating expenses and the settlement of obligations during discontinued operations 
in december  the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan for and announced the shut down of all business operations associated with the company s life sciences and specialty medical products marketplaces 
the shutdown of chemdex  promedix and specialtymd was completed by march  the businesses represented by promedix and specialty md were acquired in the first quarter of these transactions were recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
for promedix  the purchase consideration was million shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
the entire promedix purchase price was allocated to intangible assets 
for specialtymd  the purchase consideration was million shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
of the specialtymd purchase price  million was allocated to net tangible liabilities and the remainder to intangible assets 
the company wrote off as part of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations million of intangible assets 
no interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations 
in addition  general corporate overhead has been allocated to continuing operations for all periods presented prior to fiscal revenues from discontinued operations were approximately million  million  million for the years ended   and the company paid approximately million in for severance  lease obligations and other liabilities incurred to shut down chemdex and promedix 
at december  accrued liabilities relating to discontinued operations amounted to approximately  this balance is comprised of accruals for estimated costs to settle lease and other contractual obligations 
extraordinary gain 
during the company repurchased approximately million of convertible subordinated notes  which represented approximately of the notes outstanding at december the company recognized a gain of approximately million on the transactions 
as most of the notes have been retired  future such gains  if any  will be smaller than that which occurred in the first and second quarters of liquidity and capital resources as of december  nexprise had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  working capital approximated million 
the company completed an initial public offering of common stock in july and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
prior to the initial public offering  operations were funded primarily by the private sale of the company s equity securities  through which approximately million was raised 
in april  the company completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes payable in and realized net proceeds of million 
as a result of repurchases in march and june  million of convertible notes remain outstanding at december  net cash used in by operating activities totaled million  including numerous significant items related to restructuring  settlements and discontinued operations 
the net cash used in operating activities during this period was primarily due to losses from operations  which were partially offset by non cash charges of depreciation  and write downs of assets 
the company shut down chemdex and promedix  as announced in december  reduced lease commitments and other ongoing expenditures and completed workforce reductions that decreased total headcount from approximately people in january to approximately in february of the actions taken to reduce expenditures are expected to decrease the ongoing use of cash by operating activities to between million and million in the first quarter of  decreasing in subsequent quarters 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company had net sales and maturities of million of short term investments and used approximately million in cash for the acquisition of nexprise 
in addition  the company invested million in affiliated marketplace companies and reduced the restricted cash balance by million primarily via settlements of leases that had restricted cash as collateral 
that reduction was partially offset by the establishment of  of letters of credit that serve as collateral for the primary property leases the company is a party to 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and resulted primarily from retiring million of the outstanding million of our convertible subordinated notes in march and june the actions resulted in an extraordinary gain of approximately million 
management believes the company has adequate cash to sustain operations through and is managing its business to achieve positive cash flow utilizing existing assets 
during the company s commitments and liabilities were significantly reduced via restructuring events  settlements of long term contracts and the repurchase of convertible notes at a substantial gain 
in addition  the company reduced ongoing operating expenses by renegotiating its lease commitments  reducing purchases of other services and making workforce reductions 
it is the company s belief that the adjustments to spending that have been made  combined with receipts expected from customer contracts already in place  will carry the company through new customer contracts expected to be signed in and thereafter should provide the additional revenue required to achieve profitability 
we are committed to the successful execution of our operating plan and will take further action as necessary to align our operations and reduce expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has recently issued fas  business combinations  and fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has adopted the provisions of fas for its acquisition of nexprise  inc the company will apply statement beginning in application of the non amortization provisions of statement is not expected to result in a change to results of operations in as there was no goodwill amortized in the company wrote down to as of december  intangibles and goodwill previously acquired 
the company will test goodwill generated by the nexprise acquisition using the two step process prescribed in statement the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company expects to perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january  in the first half of the company does not believe that any reduction of the goodwill balance at january  is required 
however  based on steps the company has taken to prepare for the adoption of statement  it is possible that a portion of the million goodwill related to the acquisition of nexprise may be impaired using the impairment test required by statement an impairment required to be recognized when adopting statement would be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first half of on october   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas which is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles board opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify and asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
this standard also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
we will adopt sfas on january  when our new fiscal year begins  the company does not expect the adoption will have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition 

table of contents risk factors an investment in our securities involves significant risks  including those described below 
these risks relate to our new business model  our ability to generate revenues and gain operating efficiencies  our history of losses  significant changes  our ability to hire and retain key personnel  our reliance on the hosted environment and technology provided by others  the possible delisting of our common stock  the need to respond to rapid technological change and legal claims against us 
our actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth below and included in other portions of this document 
we have made substantial changes in our business model and shut down the businesses that had provided all of our revenues since inception in august we used approximately million in cash to acquire nexprise  inc a provider of collaborative commerce software solutions 
this business now provides all of our revenue  thus  management focus and operational efforts primarily support this business 
prior to this acquisition  the company s business model was substantially different 
in december  we shut down our chemdex and promedix marketplaces  laid off employees and restructured certain operations 
on april   we implemented another restructuring in which we terminated employees  representing two thirds of our workforce  accrued future lease costs associated with excess production equipment and facilities  and wrote off assets as well as the value of certain investments all estimates to recognize diminished future utility to the company 
during the first six months of  we ceased to provide technology and services to our remaining marketplaces  and  as part of the combination with nexprise  inc we terminated additional personnel 
furthermore  in february we acquired infoprise  inc  a provider of data management solutions 
as a result of these and similar actions  there has been a fundamental change in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing viable technology or a complete service offering 
restructurings may not sufficiently reduce operating expenses our restructurings were designed to lower our cash used for operating expenses by reducing expenses for facilities  sales and marketing  hosting  professional services and marketing arrangements and significantly reducing our current employee and contractor staffing levels 
while the restructurings have reduced cash operating expenses  our ability to adequately reduce cash used in operations  and ultimately generate profitable results from operations  is dependent upon successful execution of our business plan  including obtaining new customers 
as of december   we had working capital of million and had equity of million 
during the year ended december   we used cash in operating activities of million 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our new business plan or sufficiently reducing our operating expenses in the future 
our inability to reduce costs or to integrate our recent acquisition and develop a successful product and services offering could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to successfully transition to our new business plan 
we have a limited operating history and an evolving technology and service offering  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects the success of nexprise is based on integrating and developing a viable technology and services offering and securing new customers 
our business model is not fully developed  not proven and depends upon our ability  among other things  to develop and market technology and services solutions that achieve broad market acceptance by our customers acquire and deploy a sufficient number of customers to achieve profitability extend our technology to support a wide range of hardware and software to meet the needs of a large range of customers with a variety of needs  
table of contents acquire or license third party technologies that we require to deliver our technology and services overcome publicity related to our public announcements of restructurings  shareholder litigation and the shutdown of our former marketplaces  and  acquire customers operating in industries where we have limited experience and provide them quality technology and services 
we may not successfully address these risks 
if we do successfully address these risks  additional risks related to factors that are outside our control may prevent us from realizing sufficient revenues or profit margins to reach or sustain profitability 
for example  electronic commerce solutions may experience problems with users as a result of security and privacy concerns  general reticence about technology or the internet or the failure of the market to develop the necessary infrastructure for internet based communications  such as wide spread internet access  high speed modems  high speed communication lines and computer availability 
nexprise may not achieve the benefits we expect from both the august acquisition and the more recently announced acquisition of infoprise and this may have a material adverse effect on the combined company s business  financial condition and operating results the combined company will need to overcome significant issues in order to realize any benefits or synergies from the acquisitions  including the timely  efficient and successful execution of a number of post merger events 
key events include integrating the operations of the companies  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company  developing a product that will be attractive to existing and potential customers  and retaining existing customers and strategic partners of each company 
the successful execution of these post merger events will involve considerable risk and may not be successful 
these risks include the potential disruption of the combined company s ongoing business and distraction of its management  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into the combined company s products and services unanticipated expenses related to technology integration  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger 
the combined company may not succeed in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with the merger 
we are dependent on a small number of customers in a limited number of industries to date  nexprise has derived a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers in two industries 
many of our customers do not have contracts that extend beyond one year 
a critical component of the business plan of the combined company will be the acquisition of new customers in other industries  increasing the number of users in our current customers and renewing current contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing profitable relationships with new customers in new industries or that we will retain existing customers 
there also can be no assurance that nexprise will achieve its sales goals given the worsening business environment that has followed the september  events and the effect it may have on corporate spending for technology 

table of contents security risks and concerns may decrease the demand for our services  and security breaches may disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to our customers 
our services involve the storage and transmission of business critical  proprietary information 
if the security measures we or our third party data centers have implemented are breached  our customers could lose this information and we could be exposed to litigation and possible liability 
anyone who circumvents these security measures could misappropriate business critical proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
in addition  computer hackers could introduce computer viruses into our systems or those of our customers  which could disrupt our services or make them inaccessible to customers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
our security measures and those that our third party data centers provide may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business and reputation will suffer if these breaches occur 
we are dependent upon outsourcing providers for provision of the hosted environment for our customers  connection and performance issues have occurred and may recur we rely on third party providers for our data center services  principal internet connections and application and data hosting 
this hosted environment is critical to the provision of our software to our customers and if the environment does not work well  is cut off or fails  our customers are unable to use our solution  this causes great consternation among any hosted customer 
in the past our current primary provider has cut off or provided deficient service to our customers as a result of billing errors  disputes and technical issues 
in addition  our current primary provider has recently filed for chapter bankruptcy protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
their continued financial difficulties may have negative effects on our business  the nature and extent of which we cannot predict 
we have experienced and may continue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for such services 
the company has signed an agreement with another company to provide the hosted environment  but there can be no assurance that the transition to this environment will successfully occur to the full satisfaction of our customers 
furthermore  we depend on these third party providers for prompt delivery  installation and service of software  hardware and telecommunications equipment used to deliver our products and services 
any failures  interruptions or delays experienced or caused by these third party providers could negatively impact our relationship with users and adversely affect our brand and our business and could expose us to liabilities to third parties 
in addition  because we are required in most circumstances to enter into contracts for data center space in advance of customer commitments  if we are unable to increase our customer base at the rate that we anticipate in the geographic areas in which we have contracted for space  our operating results will suffer 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our company or any third party provider 
our and their operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
in addition  the majority of our and their network infrastructure is located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in the recent past  the western united states and california in particular has experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  certain of our and their operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
we do not have  and our third party providers may not have  multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite implementation of network security measures  the servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical and electronic break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
in addition  systems are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload systems with data which could result in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
furthermore  the failure by the third party providers to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
interruptions in our service will reduce our revenues and profits  and our future revenues and profits will be harmed if our users believe that our system is unreliable or insecure 
we have experienced system failures from time to time 
if we experience frequent or persistent system failures  our reputation and brand 
table of contents could be permanently harmed 
we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our operating results will be highly dependent on license and service revenues from one software suite and our business could be materially harmed by factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for this software suite substantially all of nexprise s license revenues have been  and the license and services revenues of the combined company are expected to continue to be  derived from the license of the ipteam tm solution 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for ipteam by future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
ipteam was commercially launched in if our competitors release new products that are superior to ipteam in performance or price  or if we fail to enhance ipteam and introduce new products in a timely manner  demand for our products may decline  and we may have to reduce the pricing of our products 
a decline in demand or pricing for ipteam as a result of these or other factors would significantly reduce the revenues we can expect in the future 
in the past  many software companies have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial release of their products 
to date  such delays have not had a material impact on nexprise s revenues 
in the future  we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis 
if new releases or products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  we could experience customer dissatisfaction or a delay or loss of revenues 
in addition  customers may delay purchases of our products in anticipation of future releases 
if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our revenues may decline 
moreover  as we release enhanced versions of our products  we may not be successful in upgrading our customers who purchased previous versions of the product to the current version 
we also may not be successful in selling add on modules for our products to existing customers 
any failure to continue to upgrade existing customers products or sell new modules  if and when they are introduced  could negatively impact customer satisfaction and our revenues 
as with most software companies  developing and selling a product that does not require significant customization in product features or sales process for any particular customer or set of customers is critical to our success 
if we are unable to resist customer requests to individualize our product or unable to develop a repeatable sales process our revenues will suffer and our costs will increase 
the company has a history of losses  no significant revenues and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow  nexprise may never be profitable prior to the nexprise acquisition  the company had derived revenues solely from product sales through its chemdex and promedix marketplaces their operations have been discontinued 
in addition  it is unlikely that we will recognize any revenue in the future related to our affiliated marketplaces 
since its inception  nexprise has recorded revenues from a small number of customers  not all of which are committed to purchase long term licenses 
there can be no assurance that the combined company will be successful in identifying new customers or negotiating commercially acceptable contractual provisions that will allow recording of revenues 
accordingly  we have little basis upon which to anticipate significant revenues 
the company has spent significant funds for the acquisition  and is subject to commitments to lease third party facilities  procure software and networking products and will likely spend a significant amount of money to further develop our operations  research and development and sales and marketing operations 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have not achieved profitability 
there can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable 

table of contents we operate in a new  highly competitive market and our inability to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies would limit our ability to gain significant market share our target market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
it will likely be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants  as there are few barriers to entry 
we have competition from a diverse group of companies 
competition may come from companies such as matrixone and ptc 
in addition  providers of various software products such as ariba  commerce one  oracle and sap may expand their product offerings to be competitive with us in the future 
our current and potential competitors may develop superior e commerce platforms that achieve greater market acceptance than our solution 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors can undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands  products and services  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to customers  potential employees  distribution partners  commerce companies and third party suppliers 
in addition  substantially all of our prospective customers have established and long standing relationships with some of our competitors 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand nexprise s customer and user base  or retain its current customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our financial performance  workforce reduction and acquisitions of nexprise and infoprise may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel in connection with the evolution of our business model and in order to reduce our cash expenses  we have enacted a number of changes in personnel including virtually all executive management and most of the board of directors have left or have announced their resignations and over the past year there have been significant workforce reductions 
the significant changes in personnel may adversely affect morale and the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
in addition  recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
if our common stock price remains under  or if we otherwise fail to comply with nasdaq rules  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could eliminate the trading market for our common stock if the market price for our common stock remains below per share through may  or we otherwise fail to meet the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
for example  the company could eventually fail the million equity requirement 
if the stock is delisted  it would significantly decrease the liquidity of an investment in nexprise common stock 
in addition  the stock may be deemed to be penny stock 
if our common stock is considered penny stock  it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practices in broker dealers who sell our securities 
for example  broker dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
also  a disclosure schedule must be prepared prior to any transaction involving a penny stock and disclosure is required about sales commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities 
monthly statements are also required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock 
because of these additional obligations  some brokers may be unwilling to effect transactions in penny stocks 
this could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and the ability of investors to sell the common stock 

table of contents the market price per share of nexprise common stock following the reverse stock split may drop and not remain in excess of the minimum bid price as required by nasdaq  as downward pressure may be created by such split or other factors may arise 
nexprise cannot predict whether the reverse stock split  if completed  will increase the market price for nexprise s common stock 
the history of similar stock split combinations for companies in like circumstances is varied 
there is no assurance that the market price per share of nexprise common stock following the reverse stock split will either exceed or remain in excess of the minimum bid price as required by nasdaq or that nexprise will otherwise meet the requirements of nasdaq for continued inclusion for trading on nasdaq 
a reverse stock split could negatively impact the value of nexprise s stock by allowing additional downward pressure on the stock price as its relative value becomes greater following the reverse split 
in other words  the stock  at its new  higher price  has farther to fall and therefore more room for investors to short or otherwise trade the value of the stock downward 
similarly  a delisting may negatively impact the value of the stock as stocks trading on the over the counter market are typically less liquid and trade with larger variations between the bid and ask price 
the market price of nexprise s common stock will also be based on nexprise s performance and other factors  some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding 
if the reverse stock split is effected and the market price of nexprise s common stock declines  the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of nexprise s overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split 
furthermore  liquidity of nexprise s common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split 
changes to our management team and board of directors may create an environment which is ineffective and or inefficient  if we are unsuccessful in developing an integrated management team  our business and results of operations could suffer most of the members of our management team and board of directors have joined us recently 
in august  ted drysdale joined us as president  varma kunaparaju as vice president  product development  and john lynch as senior vice president of sales and services 
in november  we promoted ted drysdale to president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  replacing david perry  former chief executive officer  who became vice chairman 
also in november  john glancy and thomas jones were elected to our board  replacing brook byers  jan leschly  naomi seligman and l 
john wilkerson  who resigned 
in january gary lenz and february  thomas insley were elected to our board 
in addition  in february  raj tolani joined us as vice president  engineering 
if we do not effectively integrate these executives and board members into our business  or if they do not work together with existing personnel as a management team to enable us to implement our business strategy  our business will suffer 
it is contemplated that our current chief financial officer  david zechnich  will resign effective at the end of february  and will be replaced by jerry natoli 
mr 
natoli is presently the controller of nexprise 
if we do not successfully transition mr 
natoli into the cfo role  or if he does not work well with the management team to enable us to implement our business strategy  our business will suffer 
our business involves a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle the sales cycle for the target customers of the software and services we provide tends to be lengthy  our sales cycle may be somewhat longer than those of our more established competitors 
the unpredictability of the length of our sales cycle could make it difficult to forecast revenue and plan expenditures 
additionally  any delays in deployment of our software related to our inexperience with a type of business or the size or complexity of the account would delay our ability to recognize revenue from that account 
such delays could adversely affect our financial results 
our business will suffer if we do not enhance our product or introduce new features to meet changing customer requirements the market for collaborative software and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new hardware  software and networking product introductions and internet related technology 
table of contents enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
if we do not develop technology that can respond to these changes the probability of us obtaining new customers will be remote 
in particular  we are designing our technology to support a variety of hardware  software and networking products that we believe to be proven and among the most widely used 
we can make no assurances  however  that future customers will continue to use these products 
even if they do  new versions of these products are likely to be released and we will need to adapt our technology to keep pace with changes made to hardware and software configurations and network infrastructures 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new technology  or deliver enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  we may be unable to meet the growing demands of potential customers 
in addition  as we introduce new services or technologies into existing customer architectures  we may experience performance problems associated with incompatibility among different versions of hardware  software and networking products 
to the extent that such problems occur  we may face adverse publicity  delay in market acceptance of our services or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
we anticipate our operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter important factors that could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially include the timing of obtaining new customers length of sales cycle  the timing of deploying services for new customers  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses and capital expenditures  costs related to the various third party technologies we incorporate into our products  utilization of our leased third party data center space and technology infrastructure  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  and the amount of credits that we may be required to issue to our current customers if we fail to deliver our services pursuant to contractual arrangements 
due to these and other factors  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
in future quarters  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based largely on our operating plans and estimates of future billings and revenues 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
we are dependent on intellectual property and on products licensed or purchased from third parties and are exposed to legal liability for infringement our success and ability to compete depends on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect our source code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright laws 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and 
table of contents scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results 
our business has involved the licensing of our technology to our customers 
pursuant to our existing licenses  we have made certain representations and warranties and agreed to indemnify our licensees against claims of infringement by third parties 
thus  we may be exposed to a significant risk of liability for intellectual property infringement claims by others 
our success and ability to compete also depend on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology  our business and operating results would be significantly harmed 
as part of our normal operations  we purchase  license or lease software  hardware and networking products from third party commercial vendors 
we obtain most of our components from third parties on a purchase order basis 
these products may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of these products could result in delays in the sale of our services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  procured and integrated  and these delays could result in lost revenues 
some of the key components of our services are available only from sole or limited sources 
for example  only hardware manufactured by two vendors is compatible with the solaris operating system  which is a key component of our infrastructure 
further  to the extent that the vendors from whom we purchase these products increase their prices  our gross margins could be negatively affected 
non compliance with government regulations may subject us to liability in addition to regulations applicable to businesses generally  in connection with our former business of servicing business to business marketplaces  we were subject to direct regulation by governmental agencies which includes numerous laws and regulations generally applicable to the chemical  pharmaceutical  controlled substances  human and biological reagents  medical and invitro devices  nuclear chemical businesses and environmental spills  as well as us import and export controls and import controls of other countries 
while the shutdown of chemdex  promedix and specialtymd may limit future regulatory and product liability risks  until all statutes of limitation have expired  certain legal risks will remain 
we relied on our suppliers to comply with applicable local  state and federal laws regarding the labeling and the dissemination of information on any products sold that may be hazardous or present a health threat to the user 
if these suppliers have failed  or we have failed to maintain the requisite records irrespective of the actions of the suppliers  or if either of us have failed to adequately comply with labeling and information dispensing requirements of local  state or federal laws  then we may be held legally responsible  since we held title to these products  and could be subject to governmental penalties or fines  as well as private lawsuits to enforce these laws 
we have also relied upon our suppliers to obtain appropriate approvals for products regulated by the fda and to comply with the requirements relating to those approvals and products 
the failure of suppliers to obtain or comply with those approvals  or the failure of the product advertising or labeling to be consistent with the fda approval for the products  or other failures by the products themselves  or our failure to keep regulatory records required by the fda  such as complaint files  could result in costly product recalls  significant fines and judgments  civil and criminal liabilities and negative publicity 
in addition  we may discover that we inadvertently sold other regulated products without a requisite license or permit or failed to fully comply with other local  state or federal laws governing these sales 
except as described in the next sentence  we are unaware of any current investigations  inquiries  citations  fines or allegations of violations or noncompliance relating to regulatory requirements pending by government agencies or by third parties against us 
in february  the company received a subpoena from the us department of justice  drug enforcement administration  for certain billing  invoice  and shipping records concerning sales to an unaffiliated purchaser 
it is also possible that there may be investigations or allegations that we are not aware of or future investigations or allegations 
the risk that any noncompliance may be discovered in the future is currently unknown 
although any potential impact on us for noncompliance cannot currently be established  it could result in significant civil or criminal penalties  including monetary 
table of contents fines and injunctions  for noncompliance and negative publicity  and seriously harm our business  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulations may subject us to increased administrative burdens and risks that may increase the cost of doing business as a result of any future contracting with federal  state and local agencies  we may become subject to additional laws and regulations not currently applicable to us thereby increasing our administrative burdens 
furthermore  we must comply with any new regulations in both europe and the united states  as well as any other regulations adopted by other countries where we may do business 
compliance with any newly adopted laws may prove difficult and may harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face risks associated with shareholder and bondholder litigation several class action lawsuits have been filed and served on the company alleging that the company and certain individuals made false and misleading statements concerning our business model and earnings for fiscal and concerning the company s initial public offering 
although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the actions and intend to defend the suits vigorously  we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits 
our defense against such lawsuits will be costly and will require a significant commitment of time and resources by our senior management 
our common stock price is especially volatile which could result in substantial losses to investors 
the stock market and specifically the stock of internet related companies have been very volatile 
this broad market volatility and industry volatility may reduce the price of our common stock  because our business is internet based without regard to our operating performance 
our common stock reached a high of and traded as low as during  and had a high of and low of 
during on february  the last reported sales price on nasdaq was 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related primarily to changes in interest rates 
however  we do not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting of mainly income securities with maturities of less than days 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk our sales from inception have primarily been made to us customers and  as a result  we have not had significant exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
however  in future periods  we expect increased sales in foreign markets 
as our sales will be made in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make the prices of our products less competitive in foreign markets 
if we need to reduce prices to become more competitive it will have a negative effect on operating results
