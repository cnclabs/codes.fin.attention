item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we were incorporated in october in february  we entered into a joint venture with at t wireless 
as part of the agreement  at t wireless contributed to us personal communications services licenses covering mhz of authorized frequencies in a contiguous geographic area encompassing portions of virginia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  georgia and kentucky in exchange for an equity position in triton 
as part of the transaction  we were granted the right to be the exclusive provider of wireless mobility services using equal emphasis co branding with at t within our region 
on june   we acquired an existing cellular system serving myrtle beach and the surrounding area from vanguard cellular systems of south carolina  inc in connection with this acquisition  we began commercial operations and earning recurring revenue in july we integrated the myrtle beach system into our personal communications services network as part of our initial network deployment 
substantially all of our revenues prior to were generated by cellular services provided in myrtle beach 
our results of operations do not include the myrtle beach system prior to our acquisition of that system 
we began generating revenues from the sale of personal communications services in the first quarter of as part of our initial personal communications services network deployment 
as of december   we had successfully launched and offered personal communications service to approximately million people in all of our markets 
critical accounting polices and estimates triton s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon triton s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires triton to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  triton evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
triton bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
triton believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
triton maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its subscribers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a material portion of triton s subscribers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
triton writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
triton records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while triton has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event triton were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should triton determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
triton assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of intangible fcc licenses  which we believe qualify as having an indefinite life 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these licenses during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our fcc licenses in and an annual review thereafter 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  we cannot be certain that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
revenue we derive our revenue from the following sources service 
we sell wireless personal communications services 
the various types of service revenue associated with wireless communications services for our subscribers include monthly recurring charges and monthly non recurring airtime charges for local  long distance and roaming airtime used in excess of pre subscribed usage 
our customers roaming charges are rate plan dependent and based on the number of pooled minutes included in their plans 
service revenue also includes non recurring activation and de activation service charges 
equipment 
we sell wireless personal communications handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services 
roaming 
we charge per minute fees to other wireless telecommunications companies for their customers use of our network facilities to place and receive wireless services 
we believe our roaming revenues will be subject to seasonality 
we expect to derive increased revenues from roaming during vacation periods  reflecting the large number of tourists visiting resorts in our coverage area 
we believe that our equipment revenues will also be seasonal  as we expect sales of telephones to peak in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of increased sales during the holiday season 
although we expect our overall revenues to increase due to increasing roaming minutes  our per minute roaming revenue will decrease over time according to the terms of our agreements with at t wireless 
costs and expenses our costs of services and equipment include equipment 
we purchase personal communications services handsets and accessories from third party vendors to resell to our customers for use in connection with our services 
because we subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the use of our services  the cost of handsets is higher than the resale price to the customer 
we do not manufacture any of this equipment 
roaming fees 
we incur fees to other wireless communications companies based on airtime usage by our customers on other wireless communications networks 
transport and variable interconnect 
we incur charges associated with interconnection with other wireline and wireless carriers networks 
these fees include monthly connection costs and other fees based on minutes of use by our customers 
variable long distance 
we pay usage charges to other communications companies for long distance service provided to our customers 
these variable charges are based on our subscribers usage  applied at pre negotiated rates with the other carriers 
cell site costs 
we incur expenses for the rent of towers  network facilities  engineering operations  field technicians  and related utility and maintenance charges 
recent industry data indicate that transport  interconnect  roaming and long distance charges that we currently incur will continue to decline  due principally to competitive pressures and new technologies 
other expenses include selling and marketing 
our selling and marketing expense includes advertising and promotional costs  commission expense for our indirect  direct and e commerce agents  and fixed charges such as store rent and retail associates salaries 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense includes customer care  billing  information technology  finance  accounting  legal services and product development 
functions such as customer care  billing  finance  accounting and legal services are likely to remain centralized in order to achieve economies of scale 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method  generally over three to twelve years  based upon estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease 
network development costs incurred to ready our network for use are capitalized 
depreciation of network development costs begins when the network equipment is ready for its intended use and is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
previous to january   our personal communications services licenses and our cellular license were being amortized over a period of years 
in  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets became effective  and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of intangible fcc licenses  which we believe qualify as having an indefinite life 
non cash compensation 
as of december  we recorded million of deferred compensation associated with the issuances of our common and preferred stock to employees 
the compensation is being recognized over four to five years as the stock vests 
interest income expense and other 
interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense through december  consists of interest on our credit facility  our senior subordinated discount notes due  our senior subordinated notes due and our senior subordinated notes due  net of capitalized interest 
other expenses include amortization of certain financing charges 
our ability to improve our margins will depend on our ability to manage our variable costs  including selling  general and administrative expense  costs per gross added subscriber and costs of building out our network 
we expect our operating costs to grow as our operations expand and our customer base and call volumes increase 
over time  these expenses should represent a reduced percentage of revenues as our customer base grows 
management will focus on application of systems and procedures to reduce billing expense and improve subscriber communication 
these systems and procedures will include debit billing  credit card billing  over the air payment and internet billing systems 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  for the year ended december   bringing our total subscribers to  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  the increase in subscribers was primarily due to continued strong demand for our digital service offerings and pricing plans 
the wireless industry typically generates a higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the other quarters 
this is due to the use of retail distribution  which is dependent on the holiday shopping season  the timing of new products and service introductions  and aggressive marketing and sales promotions 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that our churn rate remains consistently low due to our high quality system performance  our commitment to quality customer service and our focused collection efforts 
average revenue per user  or arpu  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to focus on attracting new customers with rate plans that provide more value to the customer at a higher average customer bill 
the decrease  or  was primarily the result of a change in our rate plan mix  as subscribers who are new to the wireless sector typically begin service with a lower monthly access plan 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to strong growth of subscribers 
equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   a decline of million  or compared to million for the year ended december  the equipment revenues decline was due primarily to a decrease in the average revenue per item sold  partially offset by an increase in the quantities sold 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in roaming revenue was the result of increased roaming minutes of use resulting from the expansion of our network  partially offset by a contractual decrease in our service charge per minute 
cost of service was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  approximately of the increase was due to the expansion of our network 
we added approximately cell sites to our network in the remaining increase of approximately over the prior year was the result of an increase in the charges paid to connect calls on other networks  including access  interconnection and toll related charges 
these increases were due primarily to increased costs of expanding and maintaining our wireless network to support an increase in the number of subscriber and roamer minutes of use 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in gross subscriber additions  partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of items sold 
selling and marketing costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased marketing and selling costs  including commission and manpower related costs 
this increase resulted from a increase in gross subscriber additions in the year ended december   versus the prior year ended december  the increase was also attributable to increasing the points of distribution in our company owned retail store channel by in general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the development and growth of infrastructure and staffing related to information technology  customer care  collections  retention and other administrative functions established in conjunction with the corresponding growth in our subscriber base 
ebitda represents operating loss plus depreciation and amortization expense and non cash compensation

during  lafayette acquired licenses  covering a population of approximately million people in areas of georgia  south carolina  tennessee and virginia  for aggregate consideration of million 
lafayette has an application pending for an additional licenses in areas of north carolina and virginia  but this application is subject to pending litigation involving the parties that formerly held these licenses  nextwave personal communications  inc and urban comm north carolina  inc 
there can be no assurance that this litigation will be resolved so as to allow these licenses to be acquired by lafayette 
the supreme court recently agreed to review the issues involved in this litigation  which will delay a resolution until at least  unless an earlier settlement is reached 
fcc license build out requirements have been satisfied for of the licenses which lafayette currently holds 
as of december   we have funded approximately million of senior loans to lafayette to finance the acquisition of licenses and expect to fund additional loans for future acquisitions 
because we do not control lafayette  we are accounting for our investment under the equity method 
ordinarily  as the investor  we would record our proportionate share of lafayette s losses in our income statement 
however  triton has committed to provide further financial support to lafayette in order to preserve its business relationship 
therefore  even in the absence of a legally binding obligation  we are now recognizing of lafayette s losses  which arise primarily from interest costs related to an assumed note payable to the fcc 
in accordance with eitf  accounting by an equity method investor for investee losses when the investor has loans to and investments in other securities of the investee  when the carrying amount of an investment has been reduced to zero  the investor should continue to report its share of the equity method losses in its statement of operations as an adjustment to the adjusted basis of the loans receivable

 business combinations 
sfas no 
supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations 
the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are i requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations  and ii establishing specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
these provisions are effective for business combinations for which the date of acquisition is subsequent to june  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no

intangible assets 
sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for certain provisions related to goodwill and intangible assets which were acquired after june  we believe that fcc licenses qualify as indefinite life intangible assets  and we will accordingly cease our practice of amortizing fcc licenses beginning in amortization expense for fcc licenses was approximately million  for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  triton will perform the required impairment tests 
we have not yet determined what the effect of these tests will be on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no primarily establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement costs 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

and develops a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows fixed interest rates senior subordinated notes  subject to interest rate fluctuations bank credit facility  our interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt and minimizing liquidity risk 
to the extent possible  we manage interest rate exposure and the floating to fixed ratio through triton pcs s borrowings  but sometimes we may use interest rate swaps to adjust our risk profile 
we selectively enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure only 
we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our senior debt portfolio 
swap counter parties are major commercial banks 
through december   we had entered into interest rate swap transactions having an aggregate non amortizing notional amount of million 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged
