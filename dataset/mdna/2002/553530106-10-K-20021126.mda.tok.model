the effects of these adjustments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
general our objective is to become the preferred supplier of industrial products for companies throughout the united states 
we intend to increase sales to existing and new customers by o increasing the size and diversity of our customer base by expanding next day ground delivery into new markets  increasing the circulation of the master catalog and expanding our targeted mail campaign  o increasing the number of product lines and skus offered  o continually developing and utilizing extensive e commerce capabilities  making it even easier and more appealing to do business with msc  and o increasing the size and improving the productivity of our direct sales force 
in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities by further increasing our direct marketing efforts  however  the costs associated with our direct marketing program will be incurred substantially in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
such costs are expected to be offset  in part  by increases in vendor funded co op payments which will offset a portion of the catalog and mailing expenses 
there can be no assurance that continued expansion of our direct mail marketing program will result in new customers or an increase in sales from existing customers

a during fiscal  the company determined that its ability to ultimately recover the value of its investments in four privately held internet startup companies was significantly impaired 
pursuant to the company s evaluation of the respective carrying amounts of each investment  either the entire cost of the investment or a significant portion thereof was charged against earnings during the third quarter of fiscal weeks we have generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  adding new products  and facilities expansions 
our primary sources of financing have been cash from operations  supplemented by bank borrowings under our credit facility 
we anticipate cash flows from operations  available cash resources and available lines of credit will be adequate to support our operations for the next months 
under the terms of the credit facility  the maximum permitted borrowings are million under an unsecured revolving credit agreement 
interest on amounts borrowed may be paid at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate at august  or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from per annum based on the ratio of total liabilities to effective net worth  or bid note rate 
this credit facility contains certain covenants limiting mergers  use of proceeds  indebtedness  liens  investments  sales of assets  acquisitions  and payment of dividends 
this credit facility also contains certain standard financial covenants 
as of august  the company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and was in compliance with all financial covenants 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended august  and september  were million and million respectively 
the decrease of approximately million in net cash provided from operations resulted from lower net income  net of non cash impairment charges  offset in part by improved net working capital requirements primarily a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended august  and september  were million and million  respectively 
the net usage of cash in fiscal and fiscal were primarily attributable to expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal years ended august  and september  were million and million  respectively 
the net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was attributable to the purchase of treasury stock  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options

during fiscal  the board of directors of the company approved a stock repurchase plan the plan that would allow for the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s class a common stock 
the plan allows the company to repurchase shares at any time and in any increments it deems appropriate 
no shares were repurchased during the first nine months of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has repurchased approximately million shares in the open market at a total cost of approximately million pursuant to the plan 
on september   the board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional million shares  in order for the plan to again permit the future repurchase of up to million shares of class a common stock on the open market

the leases most of which provide for the payment of real estate taxes  insurance and other operating costs are for varying periods  the longest extending to the year in addition  the company is obligated under certain equipment and automobile operating leases  which expire on varying dates through at august   approximate minimum annual rentals on such leases are as follows in thousands total including related party fiscal year related party commitments commitments thereafter   the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the company s million credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements for the next five years 
as of august   the company was in compliance with the covenants set forth in the company s credit facility 
management s discussion and analysis of critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
concentrations of credit risk the company s mix of receivables is diverse  with approximately  combined active customer accounts 
the company sells its products primarily to end users 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and collateral is not required 
receivables are generally due within days 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their credit worthiness 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy  etc  or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
the company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents with a high quality financial institution 
inventory valuation inventories consist of merchandise held for resale and are stated at the lower of weighted average cost using the first in  first out method or market 
deferred catalog costs the costs of producing and distributing the company s principal catalogs are deferred million and million at august  and september   respectively and included in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets in accordance with sop  reporting on advertising costs

the costs associated with brochures and catalog supplements are charged to expense as distributed 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customers 
the company reports its sales net of the amount of actual sales returns and the amount of reserves established for anticipated sales returns based upon historical return rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term notes payable under a credit agreement 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit agreement 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in the company s net income and cash flows 
the agreement allows the company maximum borrowings of million under a revolving credit agreement 
at august   the company had no outstanding borrowings and was in compliance with all financial covenants 
the agreement bears interest at the bank s base rate at august   or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from to per annum based on the ratio of total liabilities to effective net worth  or bid note rate 
the company does not make material use of derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
in addition  the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents 
we have investments in equity securities of privately held internet companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives that have no net carrying value at august  these investments have a net carrying value of million and million at september  and august   respectively 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for using the cost method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to regularly review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and cash flow forecasts for such companies in assessing the net realizable values of the securities of these companies 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
we recorded million and million in impairment losses during and  respectively
