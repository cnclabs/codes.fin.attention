item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations net sales net sales consist of the following components of of of total total total dollars in thousands retail sales direct to customer furniture manufacturing total net sales net sales for the weeks ended february  fiscal  increased million or over net sales for the weeks ended february  fiscal 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or  over net sales for the weeks ended january  fiscal 
the furniture manufacturing sales include only those sales to third parties 
total net sales include shipping fees of million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
as of february   we operated stores in states  the district of columbia and canada 
retail sales in thousands except percentages  sq

amounts and retail stores data retail sales retail growth percentage comparable store sales growth number of stores at beginning of year number of stores opened number of stores closed number of stores at year end store selling sq 
ft 
at year end retail sales decreased in fiscal as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in comparable store sales and the closure of three underperforming stores 
as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources  below  in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we received cash proceeds from a third party to cancel leases and close three of our underperforming stores 
the cash proceeds received of million approximated the net book value of the assets that were written off as a part of the store closures 
over the second half of fiscal  as part of our repositioning strategy  we reduced the number of items in our merchandise assortment by  from approximately  to approximately  items 
in connection with this process  under performing products were eliminated and new products were introduced  resulting in the introduction of approximately new product in the first quarter of fiscal retail sales in fiscal increased as compared to the prior year  primarily due to new store openings 
comparable store sales are defined as sales from stores whose gross square feet did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open at least full months 
stores generally become comparable in their th full month of operation 
in any given period  the set of stores comprising comparable stores may be different from the set of the comparable stores in the previous period  depending on when stores were opened 
direct to customer direct to customer sales consist of catalog and internet sales 
net direct to customer sales in fiscal increased million or as compared to fiscal total catalogs mailed in fiscal increased to million  as compared to approximately million catalogs in fiscal of the total catalogs mailed in fiscal  million were mailed into our retail trade areas  versus million in the prior year 
we believe that the strategy of mailing catalogs into retail trade areas increases customer traffic in 
table of contents our stores and enhances the overall brand image 
in april  in connection with our repositioning strategy  we redesigned our catalog and launched a new website to enhance the overall customer experience 
net direct to customer sales in fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal approximately half of the increase was from sales from our website  which was launched in august total catalogs mailed in fiscal increased to million  from million in fiscal furniture manufacturing we own a wholly owned furniture manufacturing company located in sacramento  california  the michaels furniture company michaels 
the large majority of furniture produced at michaels is sold through the company s sales channels 
additionally  since we acquired michaels  there have been sales of michaels furniture to third party customers 
over the past years  we have significantly reduced these sales to third parties in order to increase production capacity for inter segment sales 
inter segment sales to restoration hardware represented virtually all of michaels total sales during fiscal  and this trend is expected to continue 
cost of sales and occupancy in fiscal  cost of sales and occupancy expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to from in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal we had charges due to special items totaling million which accounted for of the increase in the cost of sales expressed as a percentage of net sales 
these charges included a million charge to reduce certain inventory being eliminated in our repositioning strategy to its net realizable value  a million accelerated depreciation charge related to reduced lives of certain long lived assets being replaced in our spring store remodel program  and a million charge related to the write down of long lived assets in eight under performing stores 
these charges are further discussed below in the section special items 
merchandise markdown and clearance activity associated with our repositioning strategy resulted in a deterioration in merchandise margins 
partially offsetting these negative factors  the cost of sales component which pertains to buying and distribution costs expressed as a percent of sales improved in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of lower freight expense to our stores  and lower payroll in our distribution centers 
in fiscal  cost of sales and occupancy expressed as a percentage of sales remained unchanged at compared to the fiscal merchandise margin improvements in fiscal as a result of better sourcing and product flow were offset by higher occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is largely due to increased marketing and fulfillment charges in the direct to customer division  increased professional fees associated with our repositioning strategy and increased health and benefit costs for our employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to improvements store payroll and other store controllable expenses 
interest expense and interest income interest expense includes interest related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest on borrowings under our line of credit facility 
in fiscal  such interest expense was million as compared to million in fiscal after eliminating non cash interest charges related to amortization of debt issuance costs for both fiscal years  interest expense was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 

table of contents the decrease resulted from the amendments of our credit facility to provide for more favorable interest rates and a reduction in debt made possible by the million net of fees raised in our preferred and common stock financings in fiscal  as discussed below 
we completed three financing transactions in fiscal in march  we completed a preferred stock financing  appointed a new chief executive officer  and amended our credit facility 
in may and november  we completed two common stock financings 
combined net proceeds from our preferred stock and common stock transactions of million net of fees were used to pay down our revolving line of credit and for other general corporate purposes 
as a result  average borrowings in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the average interest rate during the same period increased from to  primarily as a result of two high interest term loans that were part of the amendment of the credit facility in september until the anniversary of the amendment in september of fiscal  the existence of these term loans negatively impacted our average interest rate in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the two term loans were paid off in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal in fiscal  interest expense was million as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
during fiscal our average borrowings outstanding increased to million from million in fiscal interest expense in fiscal included million of amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest income  which consists of income from our short term investments and notes receivable  increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the majority of the increase was due to interest on a million loan we provided to mr 
friedman in connection with his purchase of common stock and preferred stock in march interest income in fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal income taxes the fiscal income tax benefit included a valuation allowance charge of million  as more further discussed in critical accounting policies below 
after adjusting for this charge  our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  as compared to a tax benefit rate of in fiscal and a tax provision rate of in fiscal these rates reflect the effect of aggregate state tax rates based on a mix of retail sales and direct to customer sales in the various states in which we have sales revenue or conduct business 
special items fiscal included special item charges of approximately million 
a discussion of these charges follows 
inventory lower of cost or market reserve in connection with the elimination of approximately of the items from our merchandise assortment  we recorded a charge of million to write down discontinued merchandise at year end to its estimated net realizable value 
accelerated depreciation at the beginning of the fourth quarter  concurrent with our november  private placement of common stock  we finalized our decision to remodel our stores in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we recorded an accelerated depreciation charge of million in order to reflect the shortened useful life of store fixtures and leasehold assets which were scheduled to be replaced 
asset impairment charge in the course of performing our periodic cash flow analysis of our mature stores  we determined that an asset impairment charge of million was required for eight underperforming locations 
the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the net book value of the store s long lived assets and the present value of the store s estimated future cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
tax valuation allowance in the course of analyzing our projected taxable income  we determined that a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets was appropriate 
the valuation allowance reduced our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million  from million in fiscal cash decreased largely because of the following factors the increased net losses resulting from a deterioration in merchandise margins due to increased cost of sales associated with our repositioning strategy  increased cash use in reducing accounts payable and other accrued expenses  and a reduction in cash provided from deferred lease incentives 
these factors were partially offset by a reduction in the investment in inventory as a result of lower inventory balances  and a reduction in accounts receivable 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million  to million from million in fiscal cash increased largely because of a reduction during fiscal in the use of cash for building merchandise inventories  and improved operating margins before depreciation expense resulting from expense reductions 
these factors were partially offset by reductions in cash provided from deferred lease incentives  and an increased use of cash in reducing accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
investing cash flows net cash from investing activities increased million  to a source of cash of million in fiscal  from a use of cash of million in fiscal the majority of the change is due to a reduction in capital expenditures as a result of opening only one store in fiscal as compared to in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we entered into agreements with a third party to cancel leases and close three of our under performing locations  for which we received million 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in the number of new stores 
in fiscal  new stores were added as compared to stores in fiscal in connection with our repositioning strategy  in the first quarter of we remodeled our stores and launched a new website 
capital expenditures for these projects are expected to total approximately million 
financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in march of  we completed a preferred stock financing  appointed a new chief executive officer and amended our credit facility 
in may and november of  we completed two common stock financings with various institutional investors 
combined net proceeds from our preferred stock financing and common stock transactions were million and were used primarily to pay down our line of credit and for other general corporate purposes 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million from million in fiscal  principally due to reduced borrowings under our line of credit 
on march   we amended our existing credit facility 
the amendment reduced the overall commitment under the line of credit from million to million  increased the amounts available for letters of credit from million to million and eliminated the minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda requirement 
additionally  the borrowing base calculation was modified to provide us with more available borrowings due to the pledge of additional collateral  and the interest rate was reduced by  with possible additional reductions based on achievement of future ebitda 
the amended credit facility contains minimum availability requirements based on seasonality 
the amended credit facility included two high interest term loans 
the first of these term loans was paid off in the second quarter of fiscal in september 
table of contents  the credit facility was further amended to provide for more favorable interest rates on the remaining term loan 
this loan was paid off in january as a result of the paydowns of the term loans  as of february  the maximum availability under the facility was million  with amounts available for letters of credit up to million 
availability under the credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base calculation  based upon eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the amount available under the credit facility is typically much less than the million stated maximum limit of the facility as of february  the total borrowing base available was approximately million 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants including annual capital expenditure limits  minimum inventory levels  limitations on store openings and closings  and prohibitions on dividends 
as of february   we had no loans outstanding  and million in outstanding letters of credit 
interest is paid monthly at the bank s reference rate or libor plus a margin 
the agreement expires on june  in connection with an amendment to our line of credit in september  we issued putable warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution protections at per share 
in connection with the amendment of the credit facility in march   of the  warrants were repriced to per share 
the fair value of the warrants is calculated each quarter using the black scholes model 
the following assumptions were used in our calculation as of february  expected life of months  stock volatility considered to be  risk free interest rate of  and no dividends during the expected term 
for fiscal  the mark to market revaluation of the warrants resulted in a charge of approximately million against earnings 
the warrants expire on september  as of february  warrants for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock remained outstanding 
during the first quarter of fiscal  all of the remaining warrants were exercised 
while we currently believe that our cash flow from operations  proceeds received from our various equity financings in fiscal and funds available under our credit facility will satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months  adverse developments concerning our sales performance or the availability of credit under our credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
moreover  we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs and  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
for more information  please see the section factors that may affect our future operating results  above  in particular the sections we are dependent on external funding sources which may not make available to us sufficient funds when we need them  because our business requires a substantial level of liquidity  we are dependent upon a credit facility with numerous restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility and we may be unable to raise additional funds that we will need to remain competitive 

table of contents contractual commitments the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations of the company as of february  amount of commitment expiration period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases capital leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration period less than after other commercial commitments total year years years years revolving credit facility standby letters of credit trade letters of credit total commercial commitments revolving credit facility as of february   the company had no amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  taxes on income  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies affect their more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents inventory our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
in connection with our merchandise repositioning  we recorded a charge of million to write down discontinued merchandise at year end to its estimated net realizable value  bringing our total lower of cost or market reserve to million 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived asset impairment we record a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
in the course of performing this analysis  we determined that a long lived asset impairment charge of million was required for eight under performing stores 
the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the net book value of the store s long lived assets and the projected present value of store s cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
should actual results differ materially from projected results for these or other locations  additional impairment charges may be required in the future 
goodwill we had goodwill in the amount of million at february  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we performed an impairment test of goodwill which resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill involves making certain judgements and estimates in regards to company strategies and future cash flows 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in an impairment charge 
self insurance costs we record estimated liabilities for certain self insured workers compensation programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or the costs of the medical profession increase beyond what were anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges may be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes under statement of financial standards no 
sfas accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
an analysis of projected taxable income and the corresponding utilization of these tax assets indicated that a valuation allowance of million was appropriate 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning were considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  this allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
additionally  sfas does not allow us to contemplate changes in tax laws or rates in our analysis of the utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we believe that the economic stimulus bill that was enacted on march  may have a positive impact on our analysis of our deferred tax assets  resulting in additional deferred tax assets becoming more likely than not to be realized in the first quarter of fiscal the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgement in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgement in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

basic earnings per share is calculated for interim periods  including the effect of stock options exercised in prior interim periods

diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year and for quarters with net earnings are computed based on weighted average common stock outstanding  convertible preferred stock and common stock equivalents stock options and warrants 
net loss per share for quarters with net losses is computed based solely on weighted average common shares outstanding 
therefore  the earnings loss per share for each quarter do not sum up to the earnings for the full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose no more than from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states which  to date  have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
