in management s discussion and analysis  we provide information about our general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and certain other matters affecting our operating results for the periods covered by this report 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income loss  which present the results of our operations for   and  and are summarized on the following pages 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods for the components of net income loss in the following sections 
our analysis is important in making decisions about your investment in sitel corporation 
general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates general business risks our business success depends on our ability to efficiently deploy our human and capital resources in the delivery of services to our clients 
consequently  the needs of our clients may significantly impact our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
our results of operations and operating cash flows may vary with periodic wins and losses of client contracts and with changes in the scope of client requirements 
our top clients accounted for of our revenues in  and include four independently managed business units of general motors corporation 
these general motors business units were responsible for of our total revenues in we did not have any other clients under common control that generated more than of our revenues 
the financial failure of any of these clients or the loss of any or all of their business could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our liquidity  including our ability to comply with restrictive debt covenants  may be adversely affected if we were to lose a significant client or as a result of significant changes in client demand if we are unable to efficiently re deploy our human and capital resources 
in the following sections  we also discuss the importance of our critical accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates  and their potential impacts on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies because they are the most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition  and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments estimates of uncollectible trade accounts receivable to determine an allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates of the useful lives for property  equipment  and goodwill  and estimates of future taxable income that is required to support the carrying value of deferred tax assets and estimates of the related valuation allowance 
trade accounts receivable we report our trade accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents management s estimates of the amount of our receivables that may not be collectible  net of recoveries of amounts previously written off 
these estimates are based on a detailed aging analysis of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  and changes in our client payment terms 
the financial condition of our clients may deteriorate  which may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we would record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as operating  selling  and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income  which would reduce our results of operations 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
property  equipment  and goodwill we record property and equipment at cost  and calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
we amortize leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price we paid in acquisitions  using the purchase method of accounting  and the fair value of the net assets we acquired 
we amortize goodwill on a straight line basis over years 
goodwill as of december  was million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
we monitor events and changes in circumstances which may require us to review the carrying value of our long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of our goodwill at each consolidated balance sheet date 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and goodwill based on estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
we measure impairment  if any  by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
we recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our assessment of the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement replaces the requirement to amortize goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an annual impairment test  and requires an evaluation of the useful lives of intangible assets and an impairment test for goodwill upon adoption 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   so we must adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in our financial statements for the quarter ended march  beginning january   we stopped amortizing our goodwill  which means that we will not record any goodwill amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income in and future years 
total goodwill amortization expense in was million 
we have not yet evaluated whether or not we will have any impairment charges in our consolidated financial statements in that may result from the impairment test that is required upon adoption of this statement 
deferred income taxes we must report some of our revenues and expenses differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes 
the future tax effects of the differences in these items  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  are reported as deferred tax assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future estimated taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
these assets consist of tax amortization in excess of book amortization related to the acquisition of a business and certain net operating losses and foreign tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we revise these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
use of accounting estimates management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our operating results and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  then separately discuss the components of net income loss in more detail 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our operating results on the previous page 
please refer to that discussion as you read this section 
overview we summarize our net income loss and net income loss per common share diluted  and the impacts of asset impairment and restructuring expenses and other items  in the following tables net income loss years ended december  in millions net income loss  before restructuring expenses and other items asset impairment and restructuring expenses  after tax losses on disposals of fixed assets  after tax write off of credit acquisition costs valuation allowance on uk deferred tax assets tax benefit expected to to be realized in future years net income loss net income loss per common share diluted years ended december  net income loss per share  before restructuring expenses and other items asset impairment and restructuring expenses  after tax losses on disposals of fixed assets  after tax write off of credit acquisition costs valuation allowance on uk deferred tax assets tax benefit expected to be realized in future years net income loss per share compared to we had a net loss of million  or per share  in  compared to net income of million  or per share  in results in were primarily impacted by asset impairment and restructuring expenses and other items that we recorded in the second and third quarters of the year 
these charges were offset partially by a million net income tax benefit that we recorded as a result of our election to treat certain of our foreign operations as branches of our us company for us income tax purposes 
all of these items are summarized in the table above 
excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses and other items described above in and million of after tax asset impairment and restructuring expenses in  we had net income of million  or per share  in compared to net income of million  or per share  in this decline resulted mostly from a decrease in revenues and lower gross profit margins in compared to we had net income of million  or per share  in  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in results in included a million after tax asset impairment and restructuring expense  compared to an million after tax expense in  and operating  selling  and administrative expenses were million lower in than in excluding asset impairment and restructuring expenses in and  we had net income of million  or per share  in compared to net income of million  or per share  in this increase resulted mostly from a decrease in revenues and lower operating  selling  and administrative expenses in we describe the factors affecting our   and operating results in more detail in the following section 
components of net income loss as you read this section  please refer to the following table that summarizes our income statement data on a percentage of revenue basis years ended december  in thousands revenues direct labor and telecommunications expenses subcontracted and other services expenses operating  selling  and administrative expenses asset impairment and restructuring expenses operating income loss interest expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit minority interest net income loss compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  in compared to the changes in revenues by geographic region are shown in the following table in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america revenues decreased in europe mostly due to the loss of two large clients in the united kingdom  which took their customer acquisition businesses in house  and lower revenues in spain 
the strength of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for about million  or  of this decrease 
the decrease in asia pacific primarily related to restructuring our operations in japan and transferring our existing japanese business to bellsystem in the second quarter of the decrease in north america was primarily attributable to a reduction in customer acquisition revenues that was due  in part  to the september th  attack on the united states 
the increase in latin america was attributable to new work we performed for clients in brazil and mexico 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses include the compensation of our customer service professionals and their first line supervisors and telephone usage expenses directly related to the production of revenues 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenues can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenues  direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to reduced labor efficiency caused by an unanticipated decline in revenues  a higher than normal number of client programs ramping up and ramping down during the year  and some reductions in pricing 
subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses include services provided to clients through subcontractors and other out of pocket expenses 
subcontracted and other services expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decline in these expenses was due mostly to a reduction in the use of third party contact centers in the us due to a reduction in customer acquisition services and lower reimbursable expenses in the us and europe 
operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses represent expenses incurred to directly support and manage the business  including costs of management  administration  technology  facilities  depreciation and amortization  maintenance  sales and marketing  and client support services 
operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decline in these expenses was mostly due to our restructuring plan that began at the end of the second quarter of as a percentage of revenues  operating  selling and administrative expenses were about the same in as they were in asset impairment and restructuring expenses in  we announced a restructuring plan designed to intensify our focus on core competencies  accelerate revenue growth  and improve profitability 
the key components of the restructuring plan include several major organizational changes and the streamlining of contact center operations and corporate support services to improve effectiveness and drive revenue growth 
as part of our restructuring plan  we reduced fixed overhead to improve profitability by substantially completing the following by december  eliminating approximately operating  selling  and administrative positions globally  and reducing excess capacity by closing nine contact centers plus three administrative offices  and downsizing another five contact centers plus two administrative offices  resulting in the elimination of approximately  workstations 
in connection with this restructuring  we recorded million of asset impairment and restructuring charges in we estimate that the ongoing annual savings from the restructuring will exceed million 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  based on estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
while management currently believes that estimated future operating cash flows will be sufficient to recover such assets  there can be no assurance that such estimates will be achieved 
if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved  we may need to record impairment losses on these assets in future periods 
in  we formed a strategic partnership with bellsystem  inc  japan s largest comprehensive marketing agency 
under the terms of the partnership  bellsystem provides services and support for our clients in japan and we provide services and support for bellsystem s clients in the united states 
in connection with the formation of the partnership  we restructured our operations in japan and transferred our existing japanese business to bellsystem in connection with this restructuring  we recorded a million asset impairment and restructuring charge  or million after tax  in operating income loss we had an operating loss of million in  compared to operating income of million in excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses discussed earlier  operating income as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in this change resulted from all of the factors affecting revenues and expenses discussed earlier in this section 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was about the same in as it was in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased million in compared to mostly because we recorded million of losses on disposals of certain assets  and we wrote off million of credit acquisition costs in connection with the amendment of our credit facility in income tax expense benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million in the benefit reflects a million net deferred income tax benefit we recorded as a result of our election to treat certain of our foreign operations as branches of our us company for us income tax purposes  and a million tax benefit we recorded on asset impairment and restructuring charges and losses on disposals of assets in the second quarter of these benefits were offset by a million deferred income tax expense we recorded to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years related to our united kingdom operations 
in  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes and minority interest  excluding asset impairment and restructuring expenses and the above special items  was 
the difference between income tax expense and the expense which would result from applying the statutory us federal rate of was primarily due to non deductible goodwill  net operating losses in certain subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized  higher international tax rates in certain jurisdictions  and us state and local income taxes 
compared to revenues revenues increased million  or  in compared to the changes in revenues by geographic region are shown in the following table in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america revenues increased in north america mostly due to additional services we provided to our largest client and a number of our large global clients 
the increase in latin america was attributable to new work we performed for several large clients in brazil and mexico 
the strength of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for million of the decrease in reported revenues from our european operations 
the decrease in asia pacific was due to the reorganization of our japanese business and a stronger dollar compared to currencies in the region 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenues  direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to higher labor costs  which were offset partially by lower telecommunications costs 
subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decline in these expenses is due mostly to lower subcontractor costs associated with a contract we implemented for an existing client in operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenues  operating  selling  and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to improved expense control  the combination of smaller business units into larger ones  and the elimination of smaller and unprofitable clients 
asset impairment and restructuring expenses in the second quarter of  we recorded a million asset impairment and restructuring charge  or million after tax  related to a strategic partnership we formed in may with bellsystem  inc  as previously discussed 
in  we recorded a million asset impairment and restructuring charge primarily related to the write down of capitalized software and related technology assets 
we reviewed our capitalized software and related technology assets for impairment in connection with the change in our technology strategy as it related to the adoption of a new platform for our crm software applications 
operating income loss operating income increased million in compared to excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses previously discussed  operating income increased million  or  from million in to million in this change resulted from all of the factors affecting revenues and expenses discussed earlier in this section 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million or in compared to  mostly due to a lower level of debt outstanding during income tax expense benefit income tax expense increased million in compared to  due primarily to higher level of operating income in income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes and minority interest was 
the difference between income tax expense and the expense which would result from applying the statutory us federal rate of was primarily due to non deductible goodwill  net operating losses in certain subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized  higher international tax rates in certain jurisdictions  and us state and local income taxes 
financial condition and liquidity in this section  we discuss our financial condition and liquidity and the factors affecting them 
we separately discuss cash flows  capital resources  and contractual obligations and commitments 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our financial condition and liquidity earlier in this report 
please refer to that discussion as you read this section 
cash flows the following table sets forth summary cash flow data for the periods indicated 
please refer to this summary as you read our discussion of the sources and uses of cash in each year 
years ended december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash provided by operating activities came from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million decrease in trade accounts receivable  which were partially offset by a million decrease in other liabilities 
although accounts receivable decreased during the period  we anticipate accounts receivable will increase as we continue to grow  which may require additional financing 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment  and we invested million in a joint venture in india 
in  we used cash for financing activities mostly to repay million of capital lease obligations 
in  cash provided by operating activities consisted mostly of income before non cash expenses of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
this was partially offset by million of cash proceeds we received from sales of property and equipment 
in  we used cash for financing activities to repay million of debt and capital lease obligations  net of additional borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  resulting in net repayments of million 
in  cash provided by operating activities consisted mostly of income before non cash expenses of million and a million increase in accrued expenses and trade payables  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
this was partially offset by million of cash proceeds we received from sale leasebacks of facilities and equipment 
we also acquired million of property and equipment under capital leases 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  as payments we made on debt and capital lease obligations were offset by additional borrowings 
capital resources we have historically used funds generated from operations  leases of property and equipment  equity capital  senior subordinated notes  and borrowings under credit facilities with banks to finance business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
we have a senior secured credit facility that expires in april  under which we may borrow in us dollars  british pounds sterling  and euros  which allows us to consolidate our us and european bank lines into a single multi borrower  multi currency facility 
our obligations under the facility have been guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of sitel corporation and such subsidiaries  including a pledge of our shares in such subsidiaries and certain other foreign subsidiaries 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and certain restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  repurchase stock  or make other restricted payments  purchase property and equipment  make certain investments  sell assets  or merge with another company 
the facility becomes due and payable upon a change of control of the company as defined in the credit agreement 
at june   we were not in compliance with some of the original financial covenants of the facility  which are determined quarterly based on the trailing four quarters ended on each determination date 
in august  we obtained an amendment to the credit facility that was effective as of june   which waived the noncompliance with those covenants and amended our financial covenants for future periods 
the amendment also reduced the size of the facility from million to million and removed our option to request an increase in the size of the facility to million  changed the expiration date of the facility from april to april  increased the interest rates on borrowings to basis points and the unused commitment fee basis points  and further restricted our ability to make certain acquisitions  restricted payments  capital expenditures  and investments 
as a result of the amendment  we wrote off million of credit acquisition costs related to the original facility in at december   we had million of available borrowings under the amended facility  and were in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility 
we expect to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures  and internal growth for the foreseeable future using funds generated from operations  existing cash  leases of property and equipment  and the funds available under our credit facility 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will range from to million 
future acquisitions  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
under a stock repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in february  we may repurchase up to million of our shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on general business and market conditions 
through the date of this report  we had repurchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million 
our amended credit facility limits the amount of aggregate restricted payments  including stock repurchases  to million plus certain equity transaction proceeds not currently applicable 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commitments that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we summarize our contractual obligations and commitments at december  in the following table year long term debt capital leases operating leases total in thousands thereafter total other matters quarterly results and seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our results of operations mostly due to the timing of our clients customer relationship management initiatives and customer acquisition and loyalty campaigns  the commencement and terms of new contracts  revenue mix  the timing of additional operating  selling  and administrative expenses to support new business  and the timing of recognition of incentive fees 
we experience periodic fluctuations in our results of operations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion and the implementation of clients crm activities 
in addition  our business generally tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe  and in the first quarter due to the changeover of client marketing strategies that often occurs at the beginning of the year 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on our operations in the future 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative investments and certain hedging activities 
the standard amends certain provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  which was issued in june to establish accounting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
we adopted these accounting pronouncements effective january  the adoption of these standards  including the valuation of derivative instruments outstanding on the effective date  and the related cumulative effect of adoption  did not significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
in june  the financial accounting standards board also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement replaces the requirement to amortize goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an annual impairment test  and requires an evaluation of the useful lives of intangible assets and an impairment test for goodwill upon adoption 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   so we must adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in our financial statements for the quarter ended march  beginning january   we stopped amortizing our goodwill  which means that we will not record any goodwill amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income in and future years 
total goodwill amortization expense in was million 
we have not yet evaluated whether or not we will have any impairment charges in our consolidated financial statements in that may result from the impairment test that is required upon adoption of this statement 
in october  the financial accounting standards board also issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   so we must adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in our financial statements for the quarter ended march  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated primarily with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have operations in many parts of the world  however  both revenues and expenses of those operations are typically denominated in the currency of the country of operations  providing a natural hedge 
from time to time  we enter into certain hedging transactions designed to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to short term intercompany loans and specific foreign currency transactions  however the amounts involved have not been material 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
interest rates on our senior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations are fixed  but rates on borrowings under our bank credit facility are variable 
during the year ended december   our average borrowings under our bank credit facility were million 
based on our projected cash needs for the foreseeable future  we do not expect that our exposure to changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our interest expense
