critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reporting amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to income taxes  loss and loss adjustment expenses lae reserves  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements reinsurance 
reinsurance recoverables include the balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and lae that will be recovered from reinsurers  based on contracts in force 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the company from its primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk with respect to the individual reinsurers  which participate in its ceded programs to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
the company holds collateral in the form of letters of credit or trust accounts for amounts recoverable from reinsurers that are not designated as authorized reinsurers by the domiciliary departments of insurance 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not  that all or some portion of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to establish a valuation allowance  which would impact our financial position and results of operations 
a valuation allowance has been established for approximately the full value of the deferred tax assets at december  goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the aggregate cost of companies acquired over the fair value of net assets at the date of acquisition and is being amortized into income using the straight line method over periods ranging from ten to fifteen years 
management regularly reviews the carrying value of goodwill by determining whether the unamortized value of the goodwill can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation 
in the event goodwill is impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the respective asset 
fair value is determined primarily using anticipated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal 
premiums 
premiums are recorded as earned over the period the policies to which they apply are in force 
premium deposits represent amounts received prior to the effective date of the new or renewal policy period 
the reserve for unearned premiums is determined on a monthly pro rata basis 
gross premiums include both direct and assumed premiums earned 
loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the company estimates its liability for loss and lae using actuarial projections of ultimate losses and lae and other quantitative and qualitative analyses of conditions expected to affect the future development of claims and related expenses 
the estimated liability for losses is based upon paid and case reserve estimates for losses reported  adjusted through judgmental formulaic calculations to develop ultimate loss expectations  related estimates of incurred but not reported losses and expected cash reserve developments based on past experience and projected future trends  deduction of amounts for reinsurance placed with reinsurers  and estimates received related to assumed reinsurance 
amounts attributable to ceded reinsurance derived in estimating the liability for loss and lae are reclassified as assets in the consolidated balance sheets as required by fas no 
the liability for lae is provided by estimating future expenses to be incurred in settlement of claims provided for in the liability for losses and is estimated using similar techniques 
the liabilities for losses and lae and the related estimation methods are continually reviewed and revised to reflect current conditions and trends 
the resulting adjustments are reflected in the operating results of the current year 
while management believes the liabilities for losses and lae are adequate to cover the ultimate liability  the actual ultimate loss costs may vary from the amounts presently provided and such differences may be material 
the company also has direct and assumed liabilities under covered extended reporting endorsements associated with claims made mpl policy forms  which generally provide  at no additional charge  continuing mpl coverage for claims made insureds in the event of death  disability or retirement 
these liabilities are carried within unearned premium reserves and are estimated through formula calculations that have been verified by the company s independent actuarial firm using techniques  which possess elements of both loss reserves and pension liabilities  and thus include additional assumptions for mortality  morbidity  retirement  interest and inflation 
overview reorganization and initial public offering on august   the reorganization of the exchange was consummated 
the reorganization was conducted according to a plan of reorganization adopted by the board of governors of the exchange on october  and approved by members of the exchange at a special meeting held on march  and by the commissioner of the new jersey department of banking and insurance the commissioner 
the plan has been challenged in two court actions 
on february   the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey affirmed the commissioner s order approving the plan of reorganization  rejecting all of appellants contentions  in response to an appeal filed by three individual insureds challenging the commissioner s order 
on september   the appellants petition for review of the appellate division decision by the new jersey supreme court was denied 
the matter has now been finally concluded in the company s favor 
a second court action challenging certain aspects of the plan of reorganization and seeking damages and injunctive relief that was filed by five individual insureds in january was dismissed by the trial court in august and an appeal was filed 
on july   the appellate division issued an opinion affirming the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint in all respects 
on august   plaintiffs filed a petition for certification to the supreme court seeking review of the appellate division s decision 
on january   the supreme court denied plaintiffs petition for certification 
plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration  which was denied on march  the miix group sold  shares of its common stock in the offering that closed on august  the net proceeds of the offering of approximately million consisted of gross proceeds of million less reorganization and offering costs of million and have been used for general corporate purposes  including payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares under a stock buyback program 
during august  the company approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to one million shares of common stock in the open market 
during november  the program was amended  authorizing the purchase of up to an additional two million shares 
through december    shares had been repurchased at a total cost of million and  shares have been issued from treasury at a value of million 
during  the miix group purchased  shares at a value of approximately million related to a former officer of the company 
general the medical malpractice industry is cyclical in nature 
many factors influence the financial results of the medical malpractice industry  several of which are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include  among other things  changes in severity and frequency of claims  changes in applicable law  regulatory reform  and changes in inflation  interest rates and general economic conditions 
the availability of medical malpractice insurance  or the industry s underwriting capacity  is determined principally by the industry s level of capitalization  historical underwriting results  returns on investments and perceived premium rate adequacy 
management periodically reviews the company s guidelines for premiums  surcharges  discounts  cancellations and nonrenewals and other related matters 
as part of this review  rates and rating classifications for its physicians  medical groups and other insureds are evaluated based on current and historical losses  lae defined below and other actuarially significant data 
the process may result in changes in rates for certain exposure classes 
loss and lae reserves the determination of loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves involves the projection of ultimate losses through an actuarial analysis of the claims history of the company and other professional liability insurers  subject to adjustments deemed appropriate by the company due to changing circumstances 
management relies primarily on such historical experience in determining reserve levels on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience despite the uncertainties in loss trends and the delays in reporting and settling claims 
as additional information becomes available  the estimates reflected in earlier loss reserves have been and may continue to be revised 
the company increased prior year gross reserves by million and million in and  respectively 
if prior trends continue  the company may have to increase gross reserves again in  which could materially adversely impact the company s financial position 
the company offered traditional occurrence coverage from through and has offered a form of occurrence like coverage  modified claims made  from to the present 
occurrence and modified claims made coverages have constituted the majority of the company s business throughout its history 
in recent years  however  the company had increased its claims made business 
development of losses and lae is longer and slower for occurrence business than claims made business 
in march  the company began working with the virginia bureau of insurance to place the insurance operations of its subsidiary  lp c  into run off  subject to regulatory and contractual requirements 
for the immediate future  the company expects that new jersey physician business may constitute all or a significant majority of its ongoing writings 
new jersey physician business has primarily been written under the occurrence like ppp policy 
reserves for incurred but not reported claims ibnr reserves have consistently represented the majority of total loss and lae reserves held by the company 
at december  and  gross ibnr reserves composed and  respectively  of total gross loss and lae reserves 
the decrease in the proportion of ibnr in is primarily the result of additional claims made basis reserves  which develop more quickly from ibnr reserves into reported case reserves than the company s occurrence basis loss and lae reserves 
gross loss and lae reserves on claims made medical malpractice policies amounted to million  or of total gross loss and lae reserves at december   compared to gross loss and lae reserves on claims made policies of million  or of total gross loss and lae reserves at december  the company s initial review of loss and lae payment and case reserving activity for the three months ended march  indicates that the activity  in the aggregate  was higher than expected based on prior actuarial estimates at december  in particular  activity on new jersey physicians  pennsylvania institutions and lp c claims made business was higher than expected  which was partially offset by less than expected activity for the other major business components 
the first quarter activity requires evaluation  which is currently in process  to determine the impact  if any  on net loss and lae reserves at march  it is not unusual for loss and lae payment and case reserving activity to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
reinsurance the company reinsures its risks primarily under two reinsurance contracts  a specific excess of loss contract specific contract and an aggregate excess of loss contract aggregate contract 
during  the company s retention for casualty business under the specific contract was million per loss 
for medical professional liability and commercial general liability business  coverage was provided up to million per loss above the retention 
for other casualty business  coverage was provided up to million per loss above the retention 
the company retains a co participation in covered losses 
the company has maintained specific excess of loss reinsurance coverage generally similar to that described for several years 
the aggregate contract in provided coverages on an aggregate excess of loss and quota share basis 
the primary coverage afforded under the aggregate contract attaches above a company retention measured as a loss and allocated loss adjustment expense ratio loss and alae ratio 
reinsurers provide coverage for an additional loss and alae ratio  with an aggregate annual limit of million 
the company has maintained aggregate excess of loss coverage generally similar to that described above since the company s aggregate reinsurance contracts are maintained on a funds withheld basis  whereby the company holds the ceded premiums in a funds withheld account for the purpose of paying losses and related loss adjustment expenses 
interest charges are credited on funds withheld at predetermined contractual rates 
each of the aggregate excess reinsurance contracts also contains a provision requiring that the funds withheld be placed in trust should the am best rating assigned to miix insurance company or its predecessor  medical inter insurance exchange of new jersey  fall below b 
on february   am best lowered the rating of miix insurance company to b 
on march   am best again lowered the rating of miix insurance company  to c 
the company is working with its reinsurers to establish the required trust accounts and move invested assets into trust in accordance with contract provisions 
each of the aggregate excess reinsurance contracts also contains a provision allowing reinsurers to offer additional reinsurance coverage that miix insurance company or its predecessor  medical inter insurance exchange of new jersey is obligated to accept 
for contract years beginning november  and forward  the contracts require that the funds withheld balance on a particular contract year be below  before reinsurers may offer the additional coverage 
for contract years prior to november   the contracts provide no funds withheld threshold amount  although the reinsurance intermediary has confirmed in writing that the intention of the parties was that the additional coverage would be offered only if and when the funds withheld balance was in a loss position 
no funds withheld balances are below  or in a loss position 
underwriting expenses the company s underwriting expenses increased during primarily due to the following underwriting  servicing and marketing initiatives  information systems costs  consulting fees  guarantee fund charges  severance payments and recruitment fees  and brokers commissions 
commissions for policies sold through brokers and agents typically range from to of premiums  whereas the company does not incur commissions on products it sells directly 
to the extent that brokered business represents an increased percentage of the company s business in the future  expense ratios may increase

an income tax benefit of million was recorded in  resulting in an effective tax benefit rate of as compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of in the decrease of million in income tax expense in is primarily the result of a decrease in pre tax income of million resulting in reduced tax of million at a tax rate and a net increase in taxes of million related to other items including a write off of million of non deductible goodwill expense in conjunction with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company s reinsurance subsidiary as of july  liquidity and capital resources the miix group is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of all of the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
its principal sources of funds are dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay in relation to surplus and net income without the consent of the applicable state regulatory authority  principally the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
new jersey regulations permit the payment of any dividend or distribution only out of statutory earned unassigned surplus 
the department may limit or disallow the payment of any dividend or distribution if an insurer s statutory surplus following the payment of any dividend or other distribution is not deemed adequate in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs  or the insurer is determined to be in a hazardous financial condition 
the other insurance subsidiaries are subject to similar provisions and restrictions 
no significant amounts are currently available for payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance department or bermuda registrar of companies 
as a result of these limitations  the miix group does not expect that miix insurance company will have the ability to declare and pay dividends to the miix group to meet its operating needs 
on may   the company obtained a million revolving credit facility with amboy national bank to meet certain non operating cash needs as they may arise 
the credit facility terminates may  and bears a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the company has pledged of the miix insurance company stock as collateral under the credit facility 
as of december   the company had borrowed approximately million against the credit facility  which is included in notes payable and other borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended december   the company incurred interest expense on the loan of approximately  at december   the company had fixed maturity investments in amboy national bank of approximately million earning a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the company s former ceo is a brother of the senior vice president and cfo of amboy national bank 
the company believes that the terms of the credit facility described above are as fair to the company as could have been obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
the company has initiated discussions with amboy national bank to restructure the terms of the revolving credit facility 
the restructuring discussions are ongoing and may rely in part on proceeds from the sale of the company s leasing subsidiary  hamilton national leasing corporation hamilton 
on march   the company executed a letter of intent with an unrelated third party to sell hamilton 
the sale transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of it is unlikely that the company will be able to repay the credit facility balance prior to the may  termination date and will be in default on the credit facility unless it is restructured prior to that date 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are insurance premiums collected  net investment income  proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets  recoveries from reinsurance and revenues from non insurance operations 
funds are used to pay losses and lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash flow during this period was significantly impacted by two items  one impacting cash flows during and the other impacting cash flows during during  operating cash flows were significantly increased due to one time proceeds of million collected on termination of the company s corporate owned life insurance coli program 
without these one time proceeds  operating cash flows in were million 
during  operating cash flows were significantly impacted by premium financing activity conducted by the company under a program begun in november prior to november  premium financing was conducted by a third party vendor and the company received full proceeds from financed policies shortly after the policies were written from the third party vendor 
excluding the impact of the net premium financing activity of million  operating cash flows in were million  a million decrease from this decrease resulted primarily from increases in paid losses and lae  and underwriting expenses and reduced investment income 
because of the inherent unpredictability related to the timing of the payment of claims  it is not unusual for cash flow from operations for a medical malpractice insurance company to vary  perhaps substantially  from year to year 
the company s cash flow could be further impacted by actions taken by the insurance department regulators of new jersey and virginia  as well as the company s am best rating  which is currently c  could hinder the company s ability to write new business and renew existing business 
see risks and uncertainties 
similarly  if the company cannot execute its revised business plan successfully  its cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
see business strategy and regulation risk based capital 
the company invests its positive cash flow from operating activities primarily in fixed maturity securities 
the company s current investment strategy seeks to maximize after tax income through a high quality  diversified  duration sensitive  taxable bond and tax preferred municipal bond portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
the company currently plans to continue this strategy 
at december  and  the company held collateral of million and million  respectively  in the form of funds held  and million and million  respectively  in the form of letters of credit  for recoverable amounts on ceded unpaid losses and lae under certain reinsurance contracts 
under the contracts  reinsurers may require that a trust fund be established to hold the collateral should one or more triggering events occur  such as a downgrade in the company s am best rating below b  a reduction in statutory capital and surplus to less than million  or a change in control 
during february   am best downgraded the financial strength rating of the company to b fair from a excellent 
on march   am best again lowered the rating of the company to c marginal 
following the rating action  reinsurers requested that assets supporting the fund withheld account be placed in trust 
the company is working with reinsurers to establish the required trust accounts and move invested assets into trust in accordance with contract provisions 
the company does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations from placing the funds withheld in trust 
in accordance with the provisions of the reinsurance contracts  the funds held are credited with interest at contractual rates ranging from to  which is recorded as an expense in the year incurred 
cash dividends paid to shareholders were per share in payment of dividends is subject to approval by the board of directors  earnings and the financial condition of the company 
during  the miix group board of directors suspended the payments of dividends to shareholders 
future payments and amounts of cash dividends will depend upon  among other factors  the company s operating results  overall financial condition  capital requirements  ability to receive dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries which are subject to regulatory approval and general business conditions

market risk of financial instruments market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risk associated with the financial instruments of the company relates to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to risks related to unforeseen changes in interest rates  credit quality  prepayments and valuations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to continually assess and react to each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is considered by management to be the most significant market risk element currently facing the company 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed maturity security to changes in interest rates 
the company views these potential changes in price within the overall context of assets and liability management 
to reduce the company s interest rate risk  duration targets are set for the fixed income portfolio after consideration of the duration of associated liabilities  primarily losses and lae reserves and other factors 
the tables below provide  as of december  and  information about the company s fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates  showing principal amounts and the average yield applicable thereto by expected maturity date and type of investment 
the expected maturities displayed have been compiled based upon the earlier of the investment call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns based on statistical analysis and management s judgment 
actual cash flows could differ  perhaps significantly  from the expected amounts 
at december  expected maturity date total in thousands principal thereafter amounts fair value government agency       average yield 
corporate         average yield 
mortgage backed 
        average yield 
asset backed         average yield municipal     average yield 
totals         at december  expected maturity date total in thousands principal thereafter amounts fair value government agency       average yield

totals         at december   the company had net after tax unrealized losses on its fixed maturity investment portfolio of million  which included a full value deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
the net after tax unrealized losses of million on the fixed maturity portfolio represented of total shareholders equity gross of net after tax unrealized losses on investments 
the net unrealized losses were the result of the rise in market interest rates during offset  in part  by unrealized gains during and management does not expect that significant unrealized losses will be realized on the fixed maturity portfolio given the credit quality of the portfolio at december  and the company s policy of matching asset and liability maturities 
asset and liability matching is an important part of the company s portfolio management process 
the company utilizes financial modeling and scenario analysis to closely monitor the effective modified duration of both assets and liabilities in order to minimize mismatching 
the goal of effective asset liability management is to allow payment of claims and operating expenses from operating funds without disrupting the company s long term investment strategy 
in addition to interest rate risk  fixed maturity securities like those comprising the company s investment portfolio involve other risks such as default or credit risk 
the company manages this risk by limiting the amount of higher risk corporate obligations determined by credit rating assigned by private rating agencies in which it invests 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities involve similar risks associated with fixed maturity investments interest rate risk  reinvestment rate risk and default or credit risk 
in addition  mortgage backed and asset backed securities also possess prepayment risk  which is the risk that a security s originally scheduled interest and principal payments will differ considerably due to changes in the level of interest rates 
the company purchases mortgage backed and asset backed securities structured to enhance credit quality and or provide prepayment stability 
short term investments are composed of highly rated money market instruments 
the company also holds a portfolio of equity investments 
at december   the cost and fair value of equity investments was million and million  respectively 
at december   the cost and fair value of equity investments was million and million  respectively 
a decline in value of the equity investments at december  would result in after tax accumulated unrealized losses on equity investments of million or of total shareholders equity gross of net after tax unrealized losses on investments 
effects of inflation the company considers the effects of inflation in pricing insurance coverages provided and in reserving for losses and lae 
there may be long periods between the sale of insurance coverage and the reporting of losses  particularly with respect to coverage provided by the company on occurrence basis policies 
further  there are typically significant periods of time between reporting and settlement of losses 
the actual effects of inflation on the company s operating results cannot be accurately known until losses are reported and ultimately settled 
management believes that the company s pricing and loss and lae reserving processes adequately incorporate the effects of inflation
