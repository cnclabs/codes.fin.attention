item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical information and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the company s goodwill and television station licenses is tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an impairment test indicates that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  the carrying value of goodwill is reduced by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
if an impairment test indicates that the carrying value of the television station licenses is impaired  the carrying value of the television station licenses is reduced by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the television station licenses 
both the implied fair value of goodwill and the fair value of the television station licenses are based upon assumptions which may prove to be untrue in the future 
the assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets with finite lives is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
if circumstances suggest that long lived assets with finite lives may be impaired and a review indicates that the carrying value will not be recoverable  as determined based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value 
the determination of cash flows is based upon assumptions and forecasts that may not occur 
the company recognizes product sales upon delivery of merchandise to the customer 
sales are reduced by estimated sales returns to arrive at net sales 
the company s return policy allows merchandise to be returned at the customer s discretion within days of the date of delivery 
the estimated return percentage for the twelve months ended june   was arrived at based upon empirical evidence of actual returns  and the percentage was applied against sales to arrive at net sales 
actual levels of merchandise returned may vary from these estimates 
certain of the company s accounts receivable are subject to credit losses 
the company utilizes an installment credit process called stretch pay which enables its customers to purchase merchandise over an expanded period from two to five months 
the reserve for expected credit losses is based on past experience with similar accounts receivable 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of the company s estimation process could be materially affected as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time 
management continually reviews and refines the estimation process to make it as current as possible  however  there can be no guarantee that estimated credit losses on these accounts receivable will be accurate 
the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions 
these loss provisions are calculated with the proviso that the majority of the company s inventories are eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future  its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for its valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in an amount in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to its valuation allowance would increase income tax expense in the period such determination was made

if the company declines to sell its interest  scripps has the right  but not the obligation  to require the company to sell its interest at the same price 
upon closing  scripps has agreed to loan million to the company payable by the company in three years 
the loan will accrue interest at an annual rate of  payable quarterly  and will be secured by an assignment of the company s interest in the operating company and the encumbrance of the assets of the company s television stations located in the boston  san francisco and cleveland markets 
the company will use the purchase price and these loan proceeds to retire debt and for working capital purposes 
the operating company will be governed by a five member board  three members of which will be selected by scripps and two selected by the company 
scripps has agreed to loan up to million to the operating company to be used for working capital purposes 
the company has agreed to enter into a three year affiliation agreement with the operating company  under which the company will agree to carry the network programming on its five television stations located in the boston  san francisco  cleveland  raleigh and bridgeport  connecticut markets 
the company retains the right to terminate the affiliation agreement after months 
in addition  on august   scripps purchased  shares of newly authorized series d senior redeemable preferred stock from the company for an aggregate purchase price of million

liquidity and capital resources as a result of the proposed sale of the network assets to scripps  the company believes that it will have sufficient liquidity for continuing operations 
should the sale of the network assets to scripps fail to close  management projects that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to continue operations throughout fiscal  even if the company fails to return to profitability 
the company s projections are based on a continuation of its success over the last year in adding new households cost efficiently to the reach of its network 
given the fixed nature of many of its other costs  management believes that the company can continue as a going concern even if revenue per home reached fails to improve or declines moderately

other provisions of the amendment are expected to require the company to dispose of television stations or obtain additional equity 
station disposals are not required unless the sale price is at least equal to the appraised value 
the proceeds from any disposals or additional equity must be used to reduce the balance of the credit facility 
the lender also extended the maturity of the loan from august  to september if the company is unable to meet its minimum financial projections  and if the scripps transaction fails to close  a sale of assets or additional debt or equity financing will likely be required 
the company believes that it could successfully sell  as it did in  one or more of its five owned television stations to reduce or completely eliminate its long term debt and to provide funds for operations 
because of the growth of the television network affiliate distribution system  the five stations represent less than of the total homes reached 
therefore  as the network continues to add affiliates  the company s owned stations may not be crucial to the network s ability to produce sufficient revenue to return to profitability 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company can sell assets or access the debt or equity markets on a timely basis 
our future contractual obligations and commitments at june  consist of the following payments due by period less than over total year years years years in thousands long term debt    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     in addition to the above commitments  the company has  shares of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at june  any holder of any shares of series a preferred stock may require the company to redeem all or any portion of the series a preferred stock for a redemption price per share of plus accrued and unpaid dividends

 gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 reporting the results of operations discontinued events and extraordinary items 
the amendment to sfas no 
changes the accounting treatment of certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions to require those lease modifications to be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions
