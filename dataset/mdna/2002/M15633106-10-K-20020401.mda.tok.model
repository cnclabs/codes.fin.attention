overview backweb technologies ltd 
backweb or the company is a provider of critical communications infrastructure software and application specific software that enable companies to communicate and distribute business critical  time sensitive information throughout their extended enterprise of customers  partners and employees 
backweb technology also enables companies to leverage their enterprise portal by ensuring that critical portal content is automatically distributed to users across the enterprise even when a user is offline 
our backweb proactiveportal tm solution aims to extend the reach of corporate portals to mobile or disconnected users and users who need to be notified of critical new content  thereby increasing usage of the portal and critical communications maximizing the return on investment for enterprise portals 
our backweb e accelerator tm application allows an extended enterprise or geographically dispersed organization to manage and deliver pertinent information and alerts without the use of a portal 
thus  for example  sales and service organizations  partners and resellers  and call centers can collect and distribute key data to customers  partners  and employees  keeping them updated and with confidence that users will interact with the data through alerts and notification features 
our core infrastructure software  backweb foundation tm  is a platform that allows organizations to efficiently target and deliver sizeable digital data of any format to users desktops throughout the extended enterprise 
we were incorporated on august  and commenced our operations in november during the period from commencement of operations through december   we were in a development stage and had insignificant revenues 
operating activities during this period related primarily to developing our products  building our corporate infrastructure and raising capital 
in december  we shipped the first commercial version of our software 
in august  in an effort to expand the features and functionalities of our product offerings  we acquired all the outstanding shares of lanacom inc  a canadian corporation 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair value on the acquisition date 
the purchase price of million was determined based on the value of shares originally issued and options granted 
of the total purchase price  approximately million was allocated to goodwill  representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price on the fair value of tangible and intangible assets 
the remainder of the purchase price was allocated to net tangible liabilities assumed  developed technology  and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill  developed technology and other identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life which ranges from to months 
the first backweb product  version  incorporating lanacom s headliner product  was released in january in early  we engaged in a comprehensive re examination of our business strategy and changed our strategic focus from a consumer oriented to an enterprise oriented internet communication company 
in connection with this change in strategy  we undertook a fundamental repositioning and reorganization of our work force  particularly in our sales organization 
during  we continued to enhance our infrastructure software  backweb foundation version  and in december released our first packaged application  backweb sales accelerator 
on june   backweb completed its acquisition of the software and intellectual property owned  licensed or developed by mobix communications ltd 
for an aggregate amount of million pursuant to a software and asset purchase agreement among the company  mobix and the principal shareholder of 
table of contents mobix 
backweb allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired to the following intangible assets million to in process research and development ipr d  million to intellectual property and million to assembled work force and to other intangibles 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use  therefore  backweb expensed the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d of approximately million as of the date of the acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the capitalized intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their extended useful lives of two to three years 
in  the company re positioned itself to focus on the enterprise portal space  which market analysts generally expect to be one of the fastest growing software markets in the foreseeable future 
we intend to establish backweb proactiveportal technology as the leading software system for offline enterprise portal communications and enterprise portal ratification 
we believe that the adoption of our system backweb foundation  and our backweb e accelerator application by leading companies and partners across various industries validates our technology and should facilitate broad market acceptance of our proactiveportal solution 
in addition  we believe that the selection of our products by industry leaders should promote the adoption of our critical communications solution by these companies  as well as their partners  suppliers and distributors 
we also believe that this adoption  along with the competitive advantages achieved with our products  will drive other industry participants to adopt our products as their preferred solution 
we intend to continue to focus our development efforts on increasing the functionality and flexibility of backweb proactiveportal technology to facilitate its adoption and to increase technological barriers to entry 
for a further discussion on strategy see part i  item business  strategy 
since our inception  revenues have been derived primarily from the licensing of our products and to a lesser extent from maintenance  consulting and training services 
the rate of growth of our service revenue is not commensurate with the costs of service revenues such as salaries and related expenses of our customer support and consulting organizations and cost of third party contractors to provide consulting services 
accordingly  our gross margins on service revenue are significantly lower than our gross margins on license revenue 
our products are marketed worldwide through a combination of the direct sales force  reseller channel  system integrators and oem s 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the trade receivable allowances for doubtful debts  reviewing goodwill  intellectual property and other intangible assets arising on capitalized purchased technology for impairment  review of equity investments for impairment 
revenue recognition we recognize software license revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
we have also adopted sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  for all transactions entered into after january  sop requires that revenue recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and no vsoe exists for the delivered elements 

table of contents we derive our revenue from license fees of our products  maintenance  customer training and the rendering of consulting services 
our products are generally sold through the direct sales force  resellers and oem s 
as described below  management estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we license our products on a perpetual and on a term basis 
license revenue arising from the sale of perpetual licenses is recognized in the accounting period that the sale takes place 
license revenue arising from term licenses is recognized over the contractual term of the license 
management defines a term license that is less than two years from the date of the official order form and sale taking place and revenue arising during this period is ratably recognized over the license period 
management determines a perpetual license that is two years or more  in which case revenue is recognized in the accounting period in which the official order form and sale takes place 
the determination criterion for the definition of a license sale is when persuasive evidence of an agreement has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonable assured 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our license sale is fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the fee is assessed by comparing with the price list and if a discount from the price list is applicable  whether the discount is in accordance with what management believes to be generally acceptable discounts 
the principal factors taken into account when giving a discount depend among other reasons  on the volume of licenses in the transaction  the strategic nature of the deal and customer and the future likelihood of further transactions with the same customer 
in addition  we assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess the granting of payment terms associated with the transaction  which are generally to days from the official order form date 
in cases where we do not establish reasonable assurance of collection then revenue is recognized only on the receipt of payment 
payment terms outside of these parameters are generally recognized as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history  credit worthiness of the customer and in some instances a review of the customer s financial statements 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if credit worthiness cannot be established at the time the official order form is signed  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection is made  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
for all sales through the direct channel we use a software license service agreement slsa signed by both parties and an official order form for each sale made signed by both parties 
for sales through a reseller a standard reseller is executed and evidence of orders from customers is supplied before revenue is recognized 
we recognize maintenance over the contractual period for the maintenance  which is generally one year 
maintenance is available at multiple levels of support and is priced as a percentage of the license revenue 
for those agreements where the maintenance and license is quoted as one fee  we value the maintenance as an undelivered element at standard rates and defer this over the contractual maintenance period for revenue recognition purposes 
it is optional whether a customer chooses to buy a maintenance contract 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance 
however if such an acceptance provision exists  then revenue recognition is deferred until written acceptance of the product has been received from the customer 
all agreements we make are non refundable and non cancelable 
we also recognize revenue from consulting activities  which is generally evidenced by a signed statement of work sow 
a sow may be time and materials based and the revenue is recognized at the time of invoicing the customer 
if an acceptance clause is contained in the sow  revenue is deferred until written acceptance is obtained from the customer 
a sow may also be a fixed bid 
management interprets fixed bids in a similar manner to a sow containing an acceptance clause and defers revenue recognition until the customer supplies a certificate of work completion  at which time the revenue is recognized 
the majority of the sow that are written are based on a time and materials basis 

table of contents revenue recognition for training to customers is determined when the training has been delivered to the customer 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers or cash received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the trade receivable allowance for doubtful debts management reviews on a continuing basis the uncollectibility of the trade accounts receivable and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful debts against the trade receivables 
management specifically analyzes customer accounts  account receivable aging reports  history of bad debts and the business or industry sector to which they belong  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and any other pertinent factors that come to light 
generally a provision will be made when a trade receivable becomes days past due 
in exceptional cases a provision after days past due will be waived when in the judgement of management after due diligence with the customer management is confident that the receivable is still collectible and the customer has demonstrated that payment is forthcoming 
during the year management provided for approximately million of doubtful debt provision arising primarily from the internet centric business in the business to consumer market  that arose primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty leading to certain customers no longer being able to continue business 
this provision applied to revenue of which a majority was generated during the fiscal year ending december  management is able to make reasonably objective judgments on the adequacy of other provisions relating to trade accruals 
in the case of contingent liabilities  no provision has been made 
this has involved significant management judgment that either management will prevail in the case of litigation or has sufficient insurance to cover an adverse outcome of any such material proceeding 
a discussion of the outstanding material litigation is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reviewing goodwill  intellectual property and other intangible assets arising on capitalized purchased technology for impairment we assess the impairment of long lived assets and related goodwill  intellectual property and other intangibles whenever an event occurs that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the factors we consider important in this assessment include but are not limited to the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the company 
significant negative industry or economic trends  the determination that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill arising on the purchase of intellectual property may not be recoverable is based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors 
an impairment review based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model is performed to determine the impaired amount that needs to be recorded 
net intangible assets at december  amounted to million 
in  a statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and is not expected to have an effect on the company statement of operations 
we currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the current review being undertaken 
there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge may have to be accounted for 
review of equity investments for impairment management has made certain equity investments in other company s that it believes are in the interests of the company and it s strategic objectives 
before the investment s are executed  they are approved by the company s executive management and the company s board of director s 
generally  management 
table of contents designates an executive staff member to either serve on the board of directors of the investee as a voting member or as an observer 
this process serves management to monitor the investment and to determine when an impairment review of the investment may be needed 
management performs a review of equity investments on a quarterly basis to determine if a provision for impairment is required 
this process while based on reasonably objective evidence supplied by the investee is combined with due diligence sought from general economic trends and indicators 
during the year management carried out such reviews and accounted for an impairment charge against one of its equity investments for the full amount of the equity investment in the amount of million 
significant management judgment is made when conducting these reviews and future developments in the investee may result in the impairment provision becoming a write off or reversed to some extent 
results of operations revenues our revenues are derived primarily from licensing of backweb foundation  backweb e accelerator suite and the push application server and to a lesser extent from maintenance  consulting and training services

table of contents amortization of goodwill  intellectual property  other intangibles and deferred stock compensation amortization of goodwill  intellectual property  other intangible assets and deferred stock compensation consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our acquisition of lanacom in august  deferred stock compensation in  initial write off of the acquisition of intellectual property from mobix communications ltd 
in june and amortization of intellectual property and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of intellectual property from mobix communications ltd 
in june deferred stock compensation represents the aggregate differences between the respective exercise price of options at their dates of grant and the deemed fair market value of our ordinary shares for accounting purposes 
goodwill  intellectual property and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  generally two to three years 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options based on an accelerated vesting method 
the total amortization expense related to one time write off of in process research and development was million in june amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively

in addition  the amortization of the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with borrowings from financial institutions is also charged to finance and other income and expense 
finance and other income and expense net also includes the effects of exchange gains and losses arising from the re measurement of transactions in foreign currencies 
for the twelve months ended december   finance and other income was million compared to million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in finance and other income during was due to the decrease of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase in finance and other income during and was due to interest income generated from the proceeds of the initial public offering 
write down of an equity investment the company invested during the year ended december  an aggregate of million in certain development companies in internet centric businesses in which the company believed it had a significant strategic interest 
however  due to the economic slowdown and the significant decline in capital available to and in the valuations of the privately funded internet centric businesses  the company believes that the investment in path  inc had become impaired 
accordingly  in the three months ended june  the company has recorded a charge of million to reflect impairment of these assets below their recorded cost to represent what the company s management considers to be fair value 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carry forwards and million of us federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the us net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts between the years and the israeli net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date

cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and consists primarily of proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing additional international operations and other factors 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
effective corporate tax rates our tax rate will reflect a mix of the us statutory tax rate on our us income  versus european country tax rates on our individual european country income and the israeli tax rate discussed below 
we expect that most of our taxable income will be generated in israel 
israeli companies are generally subject to income tax at the rate of of taxable income 
the majority of our income  however  is derived from our company s capital investment program with approved enterprise status under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  and is eligible therefore for tax benefits 
as a result of these benefits  we will have a tax exemption on income derived during the first two years in which this investment program produces taxable income  provided that we do not distribute such income as a dividend  and a reduced tax rate of for the next to years  depending upon the proportion of foreign ownership of the company 
all of these tax benefits are subject to various conditions and restrictions 
see israeli taxation and investment programs law for the encouragement of capital investments act there can be no assurance that we will obtain approval for additional approved enterprise programs  or that the provisions of the law will not change 
since we have incurred tax losses through december   we have not yet used the tax benefits for which we are eligible 
see item  business risk factors 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations most of our sales are in us dollars 
however  a large portion of our costs is incurred in relation to our operations in israel 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses  primarily our research and development costs  are denominated in nis 
costs not denominated in us dollars are translated to us dollars  when recorded  at prevailing rates of exchange 
this is done for the purposes of our financial statements and reporting 
costs not denominated in us dollars will increase if the rate of inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the israeli currency as compared to the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags considerably behind inflation 
consequently  we are and will be affected by changes in the prevailing nis us dollar exchange rate 
we might also be affected by the us dollar exchange rate to the major european currencies due to the fact that we operate offices throughout europe 
the annual rate of inflation in israel was in  in and in the nis was devalued against the us dollar by approximately in  in  and in the representative dollar exchange rate for converting the nis to us dollars  as reported by the bank of israel  was nis for one us dollar on december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no

 goodwill and other intangible assets the new rules  effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests in accordance with the new rules 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas which supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires  among other things  that long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  and thereafter an annual impairment review 
at this time the company has not assessed if it will have a material impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in israel and sell them in us  canada  europe and israel 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as most of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  the company does not anticipate material losses in these areas 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
