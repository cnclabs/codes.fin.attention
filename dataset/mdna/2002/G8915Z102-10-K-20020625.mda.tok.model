overview and forward outlook the company reported net revenue of  in fiscal  which was slightly below fiscal net revenue of  fiscal  in turn  had a decrease in net revenue of from net revenue of  in fiscal the company s revenue over the past two years was affected by the economic weakness generally seen throughout the apparel industry  a competitive pricing environment and the company s objective to reduce its supply of inventory to the marketplace in response to market conditions 
the company s net revenue in fiscal benefited from the contribution of th europe which  as noted above  the company acquired on july  net revenue by segment after elimination of intersegment revenue was as follows fiscal year ended march  wholesale    retail    licensing    total    gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was mainly due to the contribution of th europe  which operates at a higher gross margin than the company s overall margin  improved gross margins in the company s us wholesale and retail businesses and an increase in the contribution to total revenue of the retail segment  which generates a higher gross margin than the wholesale segment 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from before special charges in fiscal the decrease was due to reduced gross margins in the company s wholesale and retail segments  partially offset by the higher relative contribution in fiscal of retail and licensing segment revenue  each of which produce higher gross margins than the wholesale segment 
operating expenses increased to  or of net revenue  in fiscal from  or of net revenue  in fiscal this increase was partially due to expenses of th europe since its acquisition 
in addition  the company incurred increased expenses due to the growth in the retail segment  which opened or acquired stores and expanded other stores since march  partially offsetting these increases were net savings due to the company s continuing efforts to reduce expenses 
these efforts included reductions in corporate expenses and wholesale segment expenses  resulting from divisional consolidations and other streamlining efforts 
the company expects these savings to continue for the foreseeable future 
operating expenses before special charges decreased slightly to  or of net revenue  in fiscal from  or of net revenue  in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from savings realized by the company s divisional consolidations and other streamlining efforts  partially offset by increased depreciation  amortization and expenses associated with retail stores opened and expanded since the prior year 
gross interest expense decreased slightly from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  after increasing slightly from  in fiscal year the decrease from fiscal year was due to lower interest rates on  and a lower average principal balance under  the company s credit facilities  partially offset by interest expense associated with the issuance of  principal amount of senior bonds due december  the bonds and interest expense incurred by th europe since its acquisition 
the increase from to was due to higher interest rates on outstanding borrowings 
interest income decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  after increasing from  in fiscal year the decrease from fiscal year was due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances 
the increase from to was due to higher average interest rates on higher levels of invested cash balances 
the provision for income taxes decreased to of income before taxes from last year and in fiscal these changes were primarily attributable to the relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which the company s earnings are subject 
for fiscal year  the company expects that net revenue will be essentially unchanged from fiscal the company believes that operating income as a percentage of net revenue will increase by approximately basis points as compared to fiscal the projected improvement in operating income is expected to result from an improvement in gross margin  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
the projected improvement in gross margin is due to anticipated changes in the company s revenue mix and the expected growth in th europe 
the projected increase in operating expenses is expected to result from the operations of th europe and the company s expanded retail segment  which operates at a higher cost structure than the wholesale segment  offset somewhat by the elimination of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives of approximately  net income is projected to be approximately  using an effective tax rate consistent with that of fiscal the company s projections do not include the potential effect of fully adopting sfas which requires the company to evaluate its intangible assets  including goodwill  for possible impairment  using newly defined criteria 
the potential impact of this adoption  which would be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and would be a non cash and non operating charge  could result in a material decrease to the company s net income or result in a substantial net loss for fiscal year segment operations the company has three reportable segments wholesale  retail and licensing 
the company s reportable segments are business units that offer different products and services or similar products through different distribution channels 
the wholesale segment consists of the design and sourcing of men s sportswear and jeanswear  women s casualwear and jeanswear and childrenswear for wholesale distribution 
the retail segment is comprised of the operations of the company s outlet and specialty stores 
the licensing segment consists of the operations of licensing the company s trademarks for specified products in specified geographic areas 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on segment profits 
segment profits are comprised of segment net revenue less cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluded from the calculation of segment profits  however  are the vast majority of executive compensation  certain marketing costs  brand image costs associated with its flagship stores through february  amortization of intangibles including goodwill and interest costs 
financial information for the company s reportable segments is as follows see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a reconciliation of total segment revenue to consolidated net revenue wholesale retail licensing total fiscal year ended march  total segment revenue     segment profits     segment profit fiscal year ended march  total segment revenue     segment profits     segment profit fiscal year ended march  total segment revenue     segment profits     segment profit wholesale segment wholesale segment net revenue decreased by  or from fiscal to fiscal and by  or  from fiscal to fiscal within the wholesale segment  net revenue by component was as follows fiscal year ended march  menswear    womenswear    childrenswear    the decline in wholesale net revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to an overall volume reduction in the united states  mainly reflecting the company s efforts to balance supply and demand 
within the menswear component  a reduced level of consumer spending together with the loss of some market share in men s jeans to a variety of new competitors offering fashion forward street wear also contributed to the decrease in revenue 
similarly  the childrenswear business has been negatively impacted by greatly reduced discretionary spending on better childrenswear in department stores 
partially offsetting these decreases was the performance of the womenswear component  which achieved an improvement of approximately 
this component benefited from the expansion of the company s women s casual division through the introduction of plus sizes 
each of the wholesale divisions benefited from the addition of th europe in fiscal year the decrease in wholesale net revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to price reductions caused by an oversupply of product and the promotional environment of department stores where the company s products are sold offset  in part  by the liquidation of substantially higher levels of prior season goods in fiscal year the company expects wholesale segment revenue in fiscal year to be level with to below fiscal revenue  with decreases in menswear and childrenswear  caused by lower levels of projected off price sales and lower receipt plans by major retail customers in the us  offset somewhat by increases in the womenswear component and the european business 
wholesale segment profits decreased by  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year and by  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of segment revenue  segment profits were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in wholesale segment profits from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to reduced volume in the company s us wholesale business 
this decrease was partially offset by slightly higher us gross margins and a reduction in us sg a expenses  as well as by the contribution in fiscal of th europe s wholesale operations  which operated at a higher segment profit percentage than the company s us business 
the decrease in wholesale segment profits from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to the decrease in segment revenue  which in turn resulted from price reductions caused by an oversupply of product and the promotional environment of department stores where the company s products are sold 
in addition  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased from fiscal to fiscal due to the price reductions as well as the liquidation of substantially higher levels of prior season goods through the company s normal off price channels 
these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses  which reflects savings realized by the company s divisional consolidations and other streamlining efforts 
retail segment retail segment revenue increased  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year and  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year the improvements in each year were due to increases in the number of stores and the expansion of certain stores into larger formats offset  in part  by decreases in sales at existing stores 
management believes that the decreases at existing stores was due to reduced customer traffic and softer economic conditions 
the company operated including in europe  and retail stores as of march   and  respectively 
retail stores opened or acquired during fiscal years and contributed net revenue of  and  respectively  during those years 
revenue in the retail segment is expected to grow to in fiscal year  driven by sales at stores opened within the past year in both the specialty and outlet divisions 
retail segment profits decreased  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year and  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year as a percentage of segment revenue  segment profits were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of segment revenue decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year due to operating losses in the company s us specialty retail division 
during fiscal year  the company opened specialty stores in the us this expansion coincided with a downturn in mall traffic  an intensely promotional climate throughout apparel retailing and a lackluster fall and holiday season for menswear 
partially offsetting this decrease was an improvement in gross margins of the company s outlet division due to lower levels of markdowns as the division operated with much leaner inventories 
segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the promotional environment in department stores and reduced customer traffic  reflecting softer economic conditions and higher energy prices  all of which had the effect of reducing retail prices and  therefore  gross margins 
licensing segment licensing segment revenue decreased by  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year after remaining essentially unchanged from fiscal year to fiscal year segment revenue decreased in fiscal due principally to the elimination in consolidation of royalties from th europe since the date of the th europe acquisition 
new products introduced under licenses entered into during fiscal years and contributed a de minimus amount of revenue during those respective years 
the company expects licensing segment revenue in fiscal year to be level with to below fiscal revenue 
licensing segment profits decreased by  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the reduction in licensing royalties from th europe mentioned above 
segment profit decreased  or  from fiscal year to fiscal year due to the inclusion in fiscal year of a legal settlement received from wal mart stores  inc of  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations continues to be the company s primary source of funds to finance operating needs  capital expenditures and debt service 
capital expenditures primarily relate to construction of additional retail stores as well as maintenance or selective expansion of the company s in store shop and fixtured area program 
the company s sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations and the company s available credit 
the company s cash and cash equivalents balance increased from  at march  to  at march  this represented an overall increase of  due primarily to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of the bonds 
in fiscal  the company generated net cash from operating activities of  consisting of  of net income adjusted for non cash items and  of cash provided by changes in working capital  primarily reductions of  and  in inventory and accounts receivable  respectively 
partially offsetting this increase was cash used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities included the  cash purchase price for the th europe acquisition and  of related transaction expenses net of cash acquired  as well as capital expenditures of  capital expenditures were made principally in support of the company s retail store openings and expansions as well as facilities and selected in store shops and fixtured areas 
cash provided by financing activities included  of net proceeds after underwriting discounts and transaction expenses from the issuance of the bonds  short term borrowings under th europe s credit facility and the proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares under the company s employee stock option program  partially offset by scheduled debt repayments of  the early retirement of  principal amount of outstanding bank term and public debt and the pay down of the  principal amount of outstanding direct borrowings under th usa s revolving credit line all as described below 
a more detailed analysis of the changes in cash equivalents is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
at march   accrued expenses and other current liabilities included  of open letters of credit for inventory purchased 
additionally  at march   th usa was contingently liable for unexpired bank letters of credit of  related to commitments of th usa to suppliers for the purchase of inventories 
as of march   the company s principal debt facilities consisted of  of notes maturing on june  the notes   of notes maturing on june  the notes  the bonds and a  revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the notes  notes and the bonds collectively  the notes were issued by th usa and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by thc 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of subsidiaries of thc to incur additional indebtedness  restrict the ability of thc and its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness secured by liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions and restrict the ability of thc and th usa to engage in mergers or consolidations 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  principal amount of the notes in open market transactions 
the credit facility  which is guaranteed by thc  consists of an unsecured  th usa revolving credit line  expiring on march   of which up to  may be used for direct borrowings 
the credit facility is available for letters of credit  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
as of march   there were no direct borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and  of the available borrowings under the credit facility had been used to open the letters of credit described above 
the weighted average annual interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility for the fiscal years ended march  and was and  respectively 
during fiscal  in addition to making  in scheduled amortization payments under its  five year term loan facility  the company prepaid the remaining principal balance of  the company also paid down  principal amount of outstanding direct borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of subsidiaries of thc to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  create liens on assets  pay dividends or make other payments in respect of capital stock  make investments  loans and advances  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  engage in mergers or consolidations or change the businesses conducted by them

the company was in compliance with all covenants in respect of the notes and the credit facility as of march  certain of the company s non us subsidiaries have separate credit facilities for working capital or trade financing purposes 
in addition to short term borrowings of  as of march  these subsidiaries were contingently liable for unexpired bank letters of credit of  related to commitments of these subsidiaries to suppliers for the purchase of inventory and bank guarantees of borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates which  on a weighted average annual basis  amounted to and as of  and for the fiscal year ended  march   respectively 
the company attempts to mitigate the risks associated with adverse movements in interest rates by establishing and maintaining a favorable balance of fixed and floating rate debt and cash on hand 
management also believes that significant flexibility remains available in the form of additional borrowing capacity and the ability to prepay long term debt  if so desired  in response to changing conditions in the debt markets 
because such flexibility exists  the company does not normally enter into specific hedging transactions to further mitigate interest rate risks  except in the case of specific  material borrowing transactions 
no interest rate hedging contracts were in place as of march  the company intends to fund its cash requirements for fiscal and future years from available cash balances  internally generated funds and borrowings available under the credit facility or similar replacement facilities 
the company believes that these resources will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements for such periods 
the company also believes that it will be able to renew its revolving credit line on terms similar to those of the credit facility  which expires on march  as of march   the company s contractual cash obligations by future period are as follows payments due less than after year years years years operating leases     debt repayments    total     there were no significant committed capital expenditures at march  the company expects fiscal capital expenditures to approximate  to  existing cash may also be used to conduct the company s debt repurchase program  announced april   which authorizes the repurchase of up to  principal amount of the notes as defined below 
as of june    principal amount of the notes were repurchased under this program 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by the company  including the use of estimates  are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in item critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time and where different estimates that management reasonably could have used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company s most critical accounting estimates relate to the following adjustments to revenue  accounts receivable  inventories  and deferred tax assets and are discussed below 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these critical estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates and such differences could be material 
adjustments to revenue net revenue from wholesale product sales is recognized upon the transfer of title and risk of ownership to customers 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of discounts  as well as provisions for estimated returns  allowances and doubtful accounts 
on a seasonal basis  the company negotiates price adjustments with retailers as sales incentives or to partially reimburse them for the cost of certain promotions 
the company estimates the cost of such adjustments on an ongoing basis considering historical trends  projected seasonal results and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
these costs are recorded as a reduction to net revenue 
the company s estimates of these costs have historically been reasonably accurate 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain retail store customers 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historic trends and an evaluation of economic conditions 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
substantially all inventories are comprised of finished goods 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
deferred tax assets the company evaluates the probability of realizing its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
this evaluation includes estimating the company s future taxable income in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates as well as the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
the company is required to provide a valuation allowance if it is determined to be more likely than not that the company will not be able to realize certain of its deferred tax assets 
for certain of the company s deferred tax assets  the company had previously determined that it was not more likely than not that these assets will be realized and recorded the appropriate valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize certain of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
conversely  if the company should determine that an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance is required  such an adjustment would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
seasonality the company s business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
the company s wholesale revenue  particularly those from its european operations  is generally highest during the second and fourth fiscal quarters  while the company s retail segment generally contributes its highest levels of revenue during the third fiscal quarter 
as the timing of wholesale product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  results for any particular quarter might not be indicative of results for the full year 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its net revenue or profitability in recent years 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for substantially all of its product sales 
substantially all inventory purchases from contract manufacturers throughout the world are also denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs  however  due to the number of currencies involved and the fact that not all foreign currencies react in the same manner against the united states dollar  the company cannot quantify in any meaningful way the potential effect of such fluctuations on future income 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
the company does  however  seek to protect against adverse movements in foreign currency which might affect certain firm commitments or transactions 
these include the purchase of inventory  capital expenditures and the collection of foreign royalty payments 
the company enters into forward contracts with maturities generally up to fifteen months to sell or purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against such risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at march   the company had contracts to exchange foreign currencies  principally  the japanese yen  the euro and the canadian dollar  having a total notional amount of  no significant gain or loss was inherent in such contracts at march  while a hypothetical adverse change in all of the relevant exchange rates would potentially cause a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately  the company would experience an offsetting benefit in the spot rate or would otherwise achieve its desired exchange rate for the underlying transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb released sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
this statement is effective for all business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and prescribes criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for negative goodwill and the required disclosures in respect of business combinations 
the company has applied the provisions of sfas to the th europe acquisition  since it was completed after june  approximately   of goodwill and  of indefinite lived intangibles  consisting of the acquired trademark rights  will continue to be evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or apb  intangible assets  until the date that sfas is fully adopted 
in july  the fasb also released sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company adopted sfas on april   as required 
sfas requires that goodwill  including previously existing goodwill  and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized but that they be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has applied certain provisions of sfas to the th europe acquisition since it was completed after june  accordingly  the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with the th europe acquisition are not amortized 
the company continued to amortize goodwill and intangible assets that existed prior to june  through march  sfas provides new criteria for performing impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles must be performed by the company not later than june  the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
sfas introduces the concept of assessing goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
by september   the company must complete the first step of the transitional impairment test  which consists of comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit to its fair value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed as soon as possible  but no later than march  the second step of the impairment test consists of the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
with respect to the company s acquisition of its womenswear  jeanswear and canadian licensees on may   the company has unamortized goodwill and other intangibles of approximately  and  respectively  and deferred tax liabilities of  as of march  amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangibles was  and  respectively  for the fiscal year ended march  effective april   the company no longer amortizes existing goodwill or trademark rights  which are classified as indefinite life assets  or the related deferred tax liabilities 
the combined effect of these adjustments is expected to be a reduction in operating expenses of approximately  per year and an increase in income tax expense of approximately  per year 
any impairment loss recognized as a result of adopting this standard would be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statements of operations for the fiscal year ending march  and would be a non cash and non operating charge 
the company has not completed its estimate of the impact of adopting sfas on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized 
however  any such loss could materially decrease the company s reported results of net income and earnings per share or result in a substantial net loss for fiscal year in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas also extends the reporting requirements to report separately as discontinued operations  components of an entity that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas effective april   and such adoption did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
formerly eitf issue  accounting for consideration given to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
this consensus addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a customer in connection with a customer s purchase or promotion of the vendor s products 
beginning january   the company adopted the required accounting  which had no impact on the recognition  measurement or classification of revenue and expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations
