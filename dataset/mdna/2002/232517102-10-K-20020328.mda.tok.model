item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company s operations during the past three years have been most significantly influenced by fluctuations in the markets for surface mount technology and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment and by acquisitions it has completed 
since january   the company has completed three significant acquisitions  all of which were recorded using purchase accounting and therefore include the acquired results of operations only from the date of acquisition 
in addition  the company has made two technology acquisitions  which were recorded at cost 
in april  the company acquired kestra  ltd 
for approximately million 
kestra was a uk research company that was developing automated inspection equipment 
following significant additional development  the company sold its first inspection system based on the kestra technology ks series of products in the fourth quarter of in may  the company acquired certain assets of hama laboratories  inc for approximately million 
hama had commercially introduced and was selling several products that used technology similar to the technology used in the company s sensors  but for application in the semiconductor wafer mapping industry 
hama formed the basis for the company s semiconductor product line  which had previously consisted of industrial measurement devices 
in october  the company added to the newly formed semiconductor product line with the acquisition of imagenation corporation for approximately million 
imagenation was an established company headquartered in oregon that produced and sold frame grabbers and related equipment 
at the time of acquisition  however  imagenation also had under development a machine vision product concept that  if successfully developed  would integrate all vision components on a single circuit board visioncell tm to be used as a wafer mapper primarily in a semiconductor manufacturing environment and other potential applications a product that was complementary to and potentially competitive with the products sold by hama 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company expensed the fair value of in process research and development associated with these acquisitions of million in and million in the company generates approximately of its revenues from the sales and service of sensors and system products used primarily in surface mount technology smt circuit board production 
consequently  the company s revenues are most highly dependent on the level of capital spending in the global smt assembly market 
these markets have been very volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by periods of significant contraction 
although the smt markets experienced rapid growth from the second half of through  during the first half of the worldwide markets for smt equipment declined significantly and have remained at depressed levels 
the affect of this dramatic fall off in market activity caused a dramatic decline in portions of the company s business and a net loss in the fiscal year 
cyberoptics expects that the electronics market will experience only moderate recovery during the balance of and that this growth is unlikely to generate sales in its eas products that match even levels 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  income taxes  and restructuring costs 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
when management determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an estimated amount based on historical and forecasted results as well as risk factors associated with new product introductions and other market factors 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues revenues decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands oem solutions electronic assembly sensors    semiconductor products    smt systems    total    revenues from electronic assembly sensors products decreased million or during compared to  and increased million or during compared to during  revenues from electronic assembly sensors  primarily the company s laseralign and laser lead locator sensors  were negatively impacted beginning in the second quarter of the year by slow demand worldwide for smt capital equipment 
the market impact was compounded by the relatively large inventory of laseralign sensors that had been accumulated by the company s two principal customers  resulting in virtually no new orders from those customers during the remainder of the year 
in contrast  during  revenues for electronic assembly sensors grew dramatically as the markets for electronic circuit boards with surface mount components throughout the world experienced high levels of growth 
revenues from the semiconductor products including revenues from imagenation for semiconductor and other applications and revenues from several divested product lines used in other industrial measurement applications decreased or million in compared to  following an increase of million or in compared to the semiconductor product revenue decrease is attributed to a sharp decline in demand for semiconductor equipment beginning early in the year and is consistent with the decline in the overall electronics market 
the revenue decrease was comprised of a million or decrease in revenue from sale of products developed by hama acquired in may  partially offset by a million or increase in revenues from products developed by imagenation acquired in october 
the increase in revenues from imagenation resulted from the periods during which revenues were included in the company s consolidated results twelve months operations in versus two months operations in 
the decrease in semiconductor product revenue was exacerbated by the loss of revenue from industrial measurement product lines that were divested in  which accounted for million of revenue in the increase in revenue from semiconductor products during over was due to robust markets for semiconductor fabrication capital equipment  a full year s  rather than seven months  sales of hama products  and several months of revenue from imagenation products which contributed million of revenue in but no revenue in 
despite the severe downturn in the electronics markets in  smt systems revenues increased million or during compared to  following an increase of million or during compared to smt systems revenues are generated from sales of the company s solder paste inspection systems the se which was introduced during  the se formerly the cybersentry  the lsm formerly autolsm  and the ks series including ks and ks introduced in the se and ks series generated initial revenues in the fourth quarter of revenue from the se and ks series products grew and in compared to  respectively 
this increase was offset by and decrease in the revenues from the older lsm and se product lines  respectively  in compared to although most of the increase in revenues from the smt systems products were derived from newly introduced products  the company believes that increasing use of electronic manufacturing services ems companies for circuit board assembly and production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes and increased production speeds has caused demand for its inspection equipment in this product line to remain relatively stable 
international revenue totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising  and of total revenue  respectively 
the international markets of europe  japan and the rest of asia account for a significant portion of the production capability of capital equipment for the manufacture of electronics  the primary market for the company s oem sensor and smt system product lines 
gross margin gross margin decreased to of sales in from in and in gross margin is highly dependent on the volume of revenues over which to spread the fixed component of cost of sales and the related realization of manufacturing efficiencies 
during  gross margin was negatively impacted by significantly lower revenue levels and the resulting excess capacity in manufacturing and increased inventory obsolesence 
in addition  gross margin in was negatively impacted by the increased percentage of new generation smt systems revenue to total revenue  which carry a lower average margins during their introductory period 
during  gross margin was positively impacted by higher revenue levels  lower warranty costs and by increased revenue from semiconductor products  which have revenues that carry higher gross margins than the majority of the company s other products 
these improvements in gross margin were offset somewhat by costs associated with rapidly increasing production rates  such as additional overtime and increased scrap and inventory disposals 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in  compared to and in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense in compared to was primarily the result of cost reduction measures implemented during and approximately  of customer funded research and development recognized as a reduction in research and development expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by the full year impact of the acquisition of imagenation 
the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to was primarily the result of approximately  of funded development 
this decrease was partially offset by the full year impact of the acquisition of kestra and hama in the second quarter of and by other development initiatives in the eas sensor and semiconductor product lines 
during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on completion of the new high speed solder paste inspection system  the se  completion of the in process technologies acquired from kestra r ks series of products  enhancements to the semiconductor wafer mapping sensor product family  completion of the next generation of the laseralign products  development of board alignment and on head linescan cameras and the continued development of the in process technologies acquired from imagenation 
during  research and development expenses also included initial development activities for several new market based products for electronic assembly sensors 
during  research and development efforts were primarily focused on continuing development work on the laseralign technology  including the next generation of laseralign products  and sensors and development of additional future product offerings for solder paste inspection 
the company expects that the dollar level of research and development expenses during will continue at levels approximately consistent with and early selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to personnel and marketing investments made to develop the end user sales and service channel including the costs of opening and operating a singapore sales office in may to better serve asian markets  and the full year impact of the imagenation acquisitions  partially offset by cost reduction measures taken in the second half of the year and reduced selling commissions and performance bonuses 
the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses during was primarily due to personnel and marketing investments made to develop the end user sales and service channel  the full year impact of the kestra and hama acquisitions and increased selling commissions and performance bonuses 
the company expects to see a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to as the result of cost reduction measures implemented in acquired in process research and development and other in april  the company incurred approximately  of severance related costs associated with cost reduction measures 
in september  the company incurred approximately  of additional severance related costs associated with a second round of cost reduction measures 
a total of and employees were terminated in april and september  respectively 
substantially all of these costs were paid as of december  on october   the company acquired imagenation r corporation imagenation 
at the time of acquisition  imagenation had two products under development 
the first was a new generation of frame grabber that contains features that greatly exceed the performance of prior frame grabber products sold by the company 
the second is a machine vision product concept that  if successfully developed  will integrate all vision components on a single circuit board visioncell tm  to be used as a wafer mapper primarily in a semiconductor manufacturing environment and other potential applications 
at the time of acquisition the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed for either bluebird or visioncell would ultimately meet the technical specifications required for semiconductor wafer handling  or other applications  or be commercially acceptable 
the company recorded a million charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge was not deductible  for income tax reporting purposes 
the company introduced the bluebird frame grabber late in the second quarter of  and development of the visioncell technology continued during during the fourth quarter of  the company made a decision to abandon the development of the firstcheck tm product line  acquired from electronic packaging co 
epc  using technology originally acquired in accordingly  intangible assets with a net book value of  were deemed to be permanently impaired and were written off 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of kestra r ltd 
at the time of the acquisition  kestra had products under development using a statistical technique  principal component analysis pca  for the application of automated optical inspection aoi in the pre oven and post oven reflow stages of smt production 
at the time of acquisition the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed for either application would ultimately meet the technical specifications required for circuit board production or be commercially acceptable 
the company recorded a million charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge is not deductible for tax purposes under uk law 
the company released the pre oven system to the market in the fourth quarter of  following extended technical evaluations by customers  and continued to enhance the product to attempt to meet customer specifications through the first half of the company recognized the first revenues from this acquired in process technology in the fourth quarter of the company is continuing development of the in process post reflow technology and has introduced a related product  the ks the company also began development of additional product offerings ks and ks for both pre oven and post oven applications  including solder joint inspection capability  in the new ks series products were introduced in early on may   the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of hama laboratories through hama tm sensors  inc  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
at the time of the acquisition  hama had under development technology to develop laser based proximity sensors for robotic semiconductor wafer handling in a vacuum environment  and laser micrometers that determine the orientation and alignment of semiconductor wafers during the production process and other potential applications 
at the time of acquisition the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed for either the vacuum proximity sensors or the laser micrometers would ultimately meet the technical specifications required for semiconductor wafer handling  or other applications  or be commercially acceptable 
the company recorded a  charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge will be deductible  for income tax reporting purposes  in future periods 
development has been completed on the vacuum sensor and the custom kit micrometer and these products were introduced during the fourth quarter of in addition  the mini laser micrometer was introduced in the second quarter of the company has put on hold development of the acquired in process technologies related to the six inch micrometer due to manufacturability issues 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets the company recorded in amortization of acquired intangible assets  including million of goodwill amortization  during  compared to million in the amortization is attributable to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill resulting from the company s acquisition of certain technology and other assets of electronic packaging company epc during the first quarter of  the company s acquisition of kestra and hama during the second quarter of  and the company s acquisition of imagenation in the fourth quarter of the company will adopt the provisions of fasb statements no 
and effective january   which will eliminate the systematic amortization of the roughly million balance of goodwill and other intangible assets with indeterminable lives 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of it s goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
while the company does not currently anticipate an impairment charge will be required upon adoption of the statements based upon preliminary evaluations  a final evaluation has not yet been completed and an impairment charge may be required upon adoption 
the company estimates that adoption of the statements will reduce fiscal amortization expense  on a pretax basis  by approximately effective tax rate the company recorded a tax benefit of million in resulting in an effective rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development tax credits 
these benefits were partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization  and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carry forwards generated by cyberoptics uk  ltd 
formerly kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
based upon tax strategies implemented in the current year  the company expects to continue to benefit any future losses in excess of the statutory rates  and recognize tax expense at an effective rate below statutory rates in profitable years 
the company recorded a tax provision of million in resulting in an effective rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of the non deductible  in process research and development write off resulting from the imagenation acquisition  non deductible goodwill amortization  and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carry forwards generated by cyberoptics uk  ltd 
formerly kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
these items were partially offset by foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development tax credits 
during  the company recorded a tax provision of million despite generating a loss before income tax of million 
the tax provision during reflects the non deductible acquired in process research and development charge resulting from the kestra acquisition  non deductible goodwill amortization from the intangible assets related to the kestra acquisition and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards generated by kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
these items were partially offset in by benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to million of cash generated by operations and of cash provided by other common stock related financing activities 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million of cash used to acquire technology and million used to purchase fixed assets 
the company generated million of cash from operations during  due primarily to the reduction of accounts receivable by million partially off set by million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in inventories  and a million increase in taxes receivable and deferred tax assets 
the reduction of accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued expenses are attributed to the lower operating levels experienced in the increase in inventory also resulted from lower operating levels as the company was required to take delivery of longer lead time materials ordered prior to the erosion of sales 
the net loss for the year of million was more than offset by million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  the provision for inventory obsolescence and the provision for doubtful accounts 
the company generated million of cash from operations during  primarily due to net income of million plus million of non cash charges for ipr d  depreciation and amortization and the provision for inventory obsolescence  and a million tax benefit from exercise of stock options 
the cash generated from operations also included an increase of million in accounts payable and an increase of million of accrued expenses partially offset by an increase of million in accounts receivables  and a million increase in inventories 
the changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  inventories  and accounts receivable are primarily due to increased activity levels during related to revenue growth 
the company used million of cash for investing activities in compared to using million in cash used in investing activities in includes million for acquired technology including million paid for certain intellectual property and a software license  and million for acquired fixed assets  and the net purchase of an additional million of marketable securities 
cash used in investing activities in includes million for acquired businesses and million for acquired fixed assets  and the net purchase of an additional million of marketable securities 
the company generated million of cash from financing activities in  and generated million in during and  all of the cash was generated by stock related transactions  primarily stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan share purchases 
the company has no material capital commitments 
through cost reduction measures implemented during and early  management believes it has reduced the company s cash requirements to appropriate levels given the severity of the downturn being experienced by the electronics capital equipment industries it serves 
with cash equivalents and investments of million at december   the company believes current working capital and anticipated funds from operations will be adequate for anticipated operating needs 
in may  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time on the open market through negotiated transactions 
repurchased shares will be utilized for employee compensation plans and other corporate purposes 
as of december   the company has not repurchased any shares under this authorization 
at december  and  the company did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if company had engaged in such relationships 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than after december in thousands total year years years contractual obligations borrowings non cancelable operating lease obligations     total contractual cash obligations     related party transactions during  the company invested  in cash and other intangible assets for a equity interest in avanti optics corporation  a development stage company formed to develop products for the fiber optic component assembly market 
dr 
steven k 
case is both the ceo of avanti optics corporation and chairman of the board of cyberoptics corporation 
accordingly  the company accounts for this investment using the equity method 
the company s equity in the loss of avanti during was  the carrying value of the company s investment was  as of december   and was included in other assets 
in march  the company reduced its investment in avanti to zero 
since the company had no intention or commitment to continue to fund the operations of avanti at that time  the company did not recognize any additional equity in the losses of avanti in excess of the company s cost 
in march  avanti raised second round of equity capital in which the company had participation rights under anti dilution provisions of its initial investment in avanti 
the company declined to participate and accordingly its ownership interest in avanti was diluted to 
in december  the company declined a proposal from avanti whereby the company would provide a loan to avanti with repayment terms and or conversion rights based on certain future events 
in february  avanti raised a third round of equity capital in which cyberoptics again declined to participate and accordingly its ownership interest in avanti was further diluted to 
avanti continues to provide the company with funding proposals  and while there is no commitment to provide funding  the company considers each proposal based upon its merits 
inflation and foreign currency translation changes in revenues have resulted primarily from changes in the level of unit shipments resulting from a down turn in the worldwide electronics market 
the company believes that inflation has not had any significant effect on operations 
all of the company s international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly effect the company s revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of the company s products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
as a result of the kestra acquisition the company has an operating unit located in the uk 
the company also opened a sales office in singapore during the year 
the company does not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets the statement 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement also eliminates the exception to the consolidation of a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the company adopted the statement on january  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on either the financial position or operating results of the company 
in july of  the fasb issued statement of financial reporting standards no 
 business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively  the standards 
the statements eliminate the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations and the systematic amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indeterminate lives 
the company will adopt the provisions of fasb statements no 
and effective january  under these statements  the company will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles with a net carrying value of million at december  
the company had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of it s goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the first half of management currently does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by the company s board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities or certain approved corporate instruments with maturities of three years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  the portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of approximately one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the company estimates that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of the portfolio of marketable securities of approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  the company s net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
the company enters into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with its subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature on the last day of each quarter and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that date 
as a result  there were no unrealized gains or losses as of december  during year ended december   the company recognized a gain of approximately  from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements which offset the  translation loss on the underlying inter company balance 
the company s foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that its bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
the company minimizes such risk by limiting its counter parties to major financial institutions 
management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
