item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition and a discussion of the principal factors that affect consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years ended september    and references herein to   and refer to these fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in following gaap  management exercises judgment in selection and application of accounting principles 
management considers critical accounting policies to be those where different assumptions regarding application could result in material differences in financial statements 
regulatory accounting the company s accounting policies and practices are generally the same as used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap 
however  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires regulated companies to apply special accounting treatment to reflect the financial impact of regulation 
for example  in establishing the rates to be charged to the company s retail customers  the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the oregon public utility commission opuc may not allow the company to charge its customers for recovery of certain expenses in the same period they are incurred 
instead  rates are established in the future to recover costs that were incurred in a prior period 
in this situation  fas no 
requires the company to defer these costs and include them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet 
in the subsequent period when these costs are recovered from customers  the company then amortizes these costs as expense in the income statement  in an amount equivalent to the amounts recovered 
similarly  certain revenue items  or cost reductions may be deferred as regulatory liabilities  which are later amortized to the income statement as customer rates are reduced 
in order to apply the provisions of fas no 
 the following conditions must apply an independent regulator approves the company s customer rates 
the rates are designed to recover the company s costs of providing the regulated services or products 
there is sufficient demand for the regulated service to reasonably assure that rates can be set at a level to recover the costs 
the company periodically assesses whether conditions merit the continued applicability of fas no 
in the event the company should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the above criteria  it would be required to write off the related balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities  and reflect the write off in its income statement 
at september  there were  of regulatory assets and  of regulatory liabilities 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company has used estimates in measuring certain deferred charges and deferred credits related to items subject to approval of the wutc and the opuc 
estimates are also used in the development of discount rates and trend rates related to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations and accrual amounts  allowances for doubtful accounts  estimates of unbilled revenue  and in the determination of depreciable lives of utility plant 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  based on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
derivatives the company records derivative transactions according to the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
these standards require that the fair value of all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
changes during a period in the fair value of a derivative instrument would be included in earnings or other comprehensive income for the period

earnings per share net income for was  compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per share for were  a decrease from the per share earnings for versus net income was  for  compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per share for were  a improvement over the reported for operating margin operating margin for the year declined  with  of the decline attributed to two unusual revenue transactions in from off system interstate pipeline capacity transactions  and another  million contract termination charge recorded in other components of changes in operating margin are described in the paragraphs below 
residential and commercial margin for the fiscal years ended september    and are set forth in the table below months ended september in thousands degree days    average number of customers residential    commercial    average therm usage per customer residential commercial    operating margin residential    commercial    operating margins from residential and commercial customers were essentially even with fiscal year increases in the number of residential and commercial customers contributed approximately  of new margin 
temperatures  warmer than last year  contributed to a consumption decline  the effect of which substantially offset the improvement from new customer additions 
versus operating margins from sales to residential and commercial customers were up  or  in compared to the primary factors contributing to this improvement were increased deliveries to residential customers resulting from growth in the number of customers  and higher average consumption per commercial customer 
increases in the number of residential and commercial customers contributed approximately  and  respectively of new margin 
higher per customer gas usage  primarily by commercial customers  contributed most of the remaining improvement 
average residential customer consumption in was the same as in despite the fact that weather was colder in this lack of increased consumption is attributed to rate increases in january  and general conservation efforts by customers in response to the west coast power crisis in the winter of industrial and other margin 
operating margins from electric generation customers were  lower than fiscal year the slow economy  mild temperatures  and higher than normal hydroelectric generation dramatically affected demand for gas fired generation throughout the year but particularly during the third and fourth quarters 
the fourth quarter alone was down  from the prior year 
other industrial margins were  higher in fiscal year compared to  in large part  attributable to recovery from depressed consumption levels following the winter energy crisis 
additionally  margin from gas management and other services provided to existing and new customers increased  for the year 
versus total margin from industrial and other customers in declined  from increased consumption by electric generation customers resulted in a  margin increase from that sector  but this was offset by approximately  decline in margin from customers in other industries 
the energy crisis on the west coast during the winter and spring of was the major contributing factor in both these changes 
there was increased demand for electric generation  but higher energy prices influenced decisions by other customers to reduce their consumption 
the company also earned  of increased margins from providing gas management services to industrial customers  as well as providing miscellaneous services to existing and new customers 
other margin in was reduced by a charge resulting from an oregon earnings sharing mechanism 
under this arrangement between the company and the opuc  cascade refunds to its oregon customers one third of earnings that exceed a return on equity ceiling 
the amount recorded as an estimate attributable to was  capacity contracts 
during  the company benefited from one time opportunities to enter into two off system interstate pipeline transactions 
these transactions resulted in  of operating margin 
the company has no expectation of additional revenues from such sources  and this is not an on going part of cascade s business 
contract termination charge 
during the quarter ended december   the company exercised its contractual rights and terminated all of its gas supply contracts with enron based on enron s insolvency and other reasons  including concerns about its ability to perform 
these contracts supplied part of the natural gas portfolio used to serve certain non core customers 
the supply has been replaced with contracts with another supplier 
enron canada corp  a canadian entity  is disputing cascade s right to terminate one of the enron gas supply contracts 
on february   enron canada sent a letter to the company claiming that the company owes it a termination payment in the amount of  management believes the termination was fully justified and intends to vigorously contest any payment 
however  the circumstances surrounding the termination are complex  and the ultimate result is uncertain 
based on management s analysis of the latest information  the company recorded a fiscal third quarter charge to earnings in the amount of  with respect to enron canada s claim 
the effect of this charge to gas costs was a reduction of per share in earnings 
cost of operations cost of operations  which consists of operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and property and payroll taxes  was   and  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
operating expenses for  which are primarily labor and benefits expenses  increased  or from employee benefits expense increased  over the bulk of the increase is due to increasing costs of the company s medical benefit plans for active and retired employees 
in the aggregate  other expense categories decreased  due primarily to the inclusion in of  related to the installation of a new integrated work management system 
also included in operating expenses is a  charge for the settlement of a lawsuit filed against the company in in connection with personal injury claims 
versus operating expenses for increased  or from of this increase   is attributable to one time expenses related to the installation of a new integrated work management system 
excluding these one time costs  ongoing expenses increased for the year  due in large part to increases in regular compensation  and in profit sharing related to achievement of goals 
depreciation and amortization for increased  or over the increase is primarily attributable to the depreciation on computer system investments in fiscal and natural gas distribution assets added since last year 
fiscal was the first full year of depreciation on the integrated work management system installed at the end of for  the increase was  or over  related to new depreciable assets placed in service 
property and payroll taxes for increased  or over for  the increase was  or over for both years  the increases were related to higher property assessments and higher payroll 
nonoperating expense income interest expense in  net of interest capitalized  increased  from  due to the issuance of  year notes in november of interest on these notes exceeded interest on the short term debt they replaced 
versus interest expense in  net of interest capitalized  decreased  from  mainly because of the interest benefit accrued on deferred gas costs 
other non operating income decreased  mainly because of lower interest income on deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes the changes in the provision for income taxes from to  and from to are directly attributable to the changes in pre tax earnings 
other comprehensive income loss during and  the value of the assets in the company s pension plan declined  reflecting the general downward trend in common stock values 
the decline in asset values  along with a decrease in the assumed discount rate to from and a reduction in the earnings assumption rate to from  resulted in an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
to recognize this liability  the company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
this adjustment included charges to other comprehensive income loss of  in  and  in other comprehensive loss also includes credits for the deferred income tax effect of  and  for and respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business creates short term cash requirements to finance customer accounts receivable and construction expenditures 
to provide working capital for these requirements  the company has a  bank revolving credit commitment 
this agreement has an annual commitment fee  and a term that expires in the company also has a  uncommitted bank credit line 
as of september   there was no outstanding debt under these credit lines 
to provide longer term financing  the company in filed an omnibus registration statement under the securities act of providing the ability to issue up to  of new debt and equity securities 
on november   the company issued  of year debt under the omnibus registration statement  leaving  available under that registration statement for future financing 
the proceeds of the  offering were used to pay down outstanding short term debt 
because of the availability of short term credit and the ability to issue long term debt and additional equity  management believes it has adequate financial flexibility to meet its anticipated cash needs 
operating activities for fiscal  operating activities provided cash of  compared to a cash use of  for this represents a  improvement in operating cash flow between the two years 
the negative operating cash flow in was due to higher costs of natural gas purchases not passed through to customers  but deferred  while in customer rates were increased to more closely match current purchase prices 
the rate increase also included a component to recover a portion of the under recovered gas cost from for  approximately  of under recovered gas costs were collected 
current rates  approved by the wutc in november  are designed to recover the remainder of the under recovery by october investing activities cash used by investing activities in was  compared to  in investing activities are substantially all capital expenditures 
seventy nine percent of capital expenditures were dedicated to connecting new customers 
capital expenditures in included  spent to install a new integrated work management system 
budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal are approximately  which includes  for new customer connections and  for distribution system reinforcement and replacement projects 
the remainder is for equipment  facilities upgrades  and various technology projects 
financing activities financing activities for used cash of  compared to adding cash of  from short term borrowing in other than the payment of dividends  the primary financing activity in was the replacement of  short term debt with proceeds from issuance of new year notes 
environmental matters in  the company received a claim from a property owner in eugene  oregon requesting that the company assume responsibility for investigation and possible clean up of alleged contamination on property previously owned by a predecessor of cascade 
the predecessor company conducted a manufactured gas business on the property from approximately to manufactured gas operations apparently were conducted on the site by several operators beginning about the site was used for other purposes beginning in the present owner has retained an environmental consultant  which is investigating possible contamination on the property 
to date the consultant has reported that it believes contamination is present 
the contamination is consistent with that which might originate from a manufactured gas operation 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the consultant s initial report has been furnished to the oregon department of environmental quality deq 
the owner has reached an intergovernmental agreement with the deq with respect to further investigation and possible remediation of contamination on the property under the voluntary cleanup program 
another northwest utility  which purchased the property from cascade in  has declined to participate in the site investigation  although it may  as a onetime owner of the property  bear some share of the responsibility as well 
the company has notified its insurance carriers of the claim and is keeping them advised as to the investigation 
on one occasion in the past when hazardous materials on property formerly owned by a predecessor of the company required clean up  the opuc allowed the clean up costs to be passed on to customers 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking for reimbursement through rates for such costs 
in  a property owner in washington notified the company that there is contamination on his property  and that he believes it comes from a former manufactured gas site  owned at one time by a predecessor company  which was merged with cascade in the state of washington department of ecology has categorized this site as a listed site ranked in its most hazardous category 
as a former owner of the site  the company may be strictly liable to the state of washington for investigation and remediation of the contamination of the site  but may share that cost or allocate all the cost to others who actually caused or contributed to the contamination 
the company retained an environmental consultant who conducted a preliminary investigation of possible contamination at the site 
there is evidence of contamination at the site  and there is also evidence of an oil line across the site property owned and operated by others  which may be a contributor to the contamination 
there have been no estimates as to possible clean up costs 
the company has investigated title and other government records to identify other potentially liable parties 
the company has notified the other identified parties of the contamination claims  and has requested cooperation and financial contribution 
in the event the company is responsible for clean up costs not covered by insurance  management anticipates asking the wutc for reimbursement for such costs  through rates charged to customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cascade has evaluated its risk related to financial instruments whose values are subject to market sensitivity 
the company has fixed rate debt obligations  but does not have derivative financial instruments subject to interest rate risk 
cascade makes interest and principal payments on these obligations in the normal course of its business  and does not plan to redeem these obligations prior to normal maturities 
the company s natural gas purchase commodity prices are subject to fluctuations resulting from weather  congestion on interstate pipelines  and other unpredictable factors 
the company s pga mechanisms assure the recovery of prudently incurred wholesale gas cost  therefore management believes the company s commodity price risk is immaterial
