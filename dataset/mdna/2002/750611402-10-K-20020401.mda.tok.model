item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we design  manufacture  install and sell equipment used in the ground based portion of satellite communication systems to receive  and transmit data  video  audio and internet over satellite communications links 
we also design  manufacture  and sell equipment used in cable television systems 
our products are used in applications for telephone  data  video and audio broadcast communications  private and corporate data networks  internet applications  and digital television for cable and network broadcast 
we serve customers in over countries  including customers in the television broadcast industry  international telecommunications companies  internet service providers  private communications networks  network and cable television and the united states government 
on december   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of armer communications engineering services  inc armer for an aggregate purchase price of million 
this purchase price consisted of million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the stock was determined based on the average market price of the stock over a reasonable period of time before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced 
armer specializes in innovative solutions for the integration and installation of turnkey satellite communications systems 
this acquisition was recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million and has been recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over twelve years 
the results of operations of the acquired operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the acquisition date 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the assets of tiernan communications  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we manufacture the tiernan products  which are used in the television broadcast industry 
the acquisition has been recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately million and has been recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies based upon historical experience and various other assumptions  factors  and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and future conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues for orders of products to be shipped as we ship the products and transfer ownership to our customers 
we maintain allowances for sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to 
table of contents deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets 
we estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment  goodwill and other identifiable intangibles 
we may experience losses if these assets suffered impairment due to the useful lives ultimately being shorter than they were originally estimated or if the carrying value of the long lived assets are not recoverable from our operations 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our vendors  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or the inability to market its inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net sales decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the economic slowdown over the last year and was offset by sales of products from the tiernan and armer acquisitions 
the products attributable to these acquisitions accounted for approximately million of sales during the current year compared to approximately million of sales for the prior year 
we experience normal margins on the tiernan products and lower margins on the armer products 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased by to during the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in costs as a percent of sales is primarily due to changes in the mix of products shipped  namely  the typically lower margins on the armer products and higher unabsorbed overhead from our core businesses due to the lower sales during the current year 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses during the year is primarily attributed to the additional expenses associated with the armer and tiernan product lines  which were approximately million and million respectively 
research and development expenditures increased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  during the year ended december  in addition to our continued commitment to invest in our future through technological advances and our efforts to improve our older product lines for manufacturability and lower costs  the increase in research and development expenses reflects added efforts for our tiernan product lines and a significant effort to develop the ipsat related product lines 
our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries  as well as the newly acquired tiernan product lines  which target the digital television broadcast industry 
we have reorganized to reduce research and development costs for the ensuing year by reducing personnel dedicated to the ipsat product lines as we believe we are nearing completion of the development phase of this product 

table of contents as a result of the decrease in our gross profit and our higher operating costs as a percentage of sales  in compared to in  we recorded earnings from operations of million during compared to million in interest expense decreased to  in  or of sales  from  in  or 
of sales  due to the payoff of our credit line during the prior year 
interest income decreased to  in from million in the decrease is due to the reduced cash levels in compared to as discussed below  cash decreased primarily as a result of the acquisition in tiernan in april we recorded an income tax expense in of million compared to an income benefit in of million 
the benefit recorded in the prior year was primarily due to a one time tax benefit of million in the third quarter of resulting from the reduction of the valuation allowance pertaining to our net operating loss carryforward 
based on all of the above  we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted weighted average share outstanding  during as compared to million  or per diluted weighted average share outstanding  during new orders booked bookings decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the economic slowdown over the prior year 
our backlog of orders to be shipped  which are unshipped orders from the prior period plus new orders booked less orders shipped during the period  was million as of december   a decrease of from the million in backlog as of december  this reduction is a direct result of the lower bookings compared to sales during the current period 
our backlog consists of firm orders as evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net sales increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to our introduction of a number of new products into our traditional markets  which resulted in an increase in market share 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to during the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in costs as a percent of sales is primarily due to changes in the mix of products shipped 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses during the year is primarily attributed to an increase in commissions and other selling expenses due to the increase in sales compared to the prior year and an increased focus on our marketing strategies 
the decrease of sg a expenses in terms of percentage of sales is primarily due to our ability to increase sales at a faster rate than expenses 
research and development expenditures increased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  during the year ended december  the increase in expense reflects our continued commitment to invest in our future through technological advances and our efforts to improve our older product lines for manufacturability and lower costs 
our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries 
it is anticipated that we will continue to experience high research and development expenses as we position ourselves  through the introduction of new products  to gain market share 
as a result of the increase in our gross profit and our lower operating costs as a percentage of sales  in compared to in  we recorded earnings from operations of million during compared to million in interest expense decreased to  or of sales  in from million  or of sales  in due to the payoff of our credit line during the current year 
interest income increased to million  or of sales  in from  or of sales  in the increase is due to the increase in our overall cash levels in compared to as discussed below  cash increased 
table of contents primarily as a result of a public offering in february we recorded a net income tax benefit in of million primarily due to a one time tax benefit of million in the third quarter resulting from the reduction of the valuation allowance pertaining to our net operating loss carryforward 
based on all of the above  we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted weighted average share outstanding  during as compared to million  or per diluted weighted average share outstanding  during our new orders booked bookings increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the introduction of new products into the market place and an increased market share in the internet over satellite industry  in addition to increased demand for our core products 
our backlog of orders to be shipped  which are unshipped orders from the prior period plus new orders booked less orders shipped during the period  was million as of december   an increase of over the million in backlog as of december  our backlog consists of firm orders as evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december   which represents an increase in our working capital of million from our working capital of million at december  our working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively  and an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in deferred tax assets of million and a decrease in customer deposits of million 
the increases were offset by a decrease in cash of million 
see the discussion below of events related to this activity 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to a decrease in net earnings of million to million for the year ended december  in addition  inventories increased by million in compared to million in the prior period primarily as a result of increases in ipsat related hardware and inventory attributable to the tiernan product lines 
accounts receivable increased by million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of million in the year ended december  as a result of our high volume of sales during the final month of the fourth quarter of accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by million compared to million in the prior year 
these changes are due to the timing of vendor payments 
we recorded a reduction in the deferred taxes payable due to current year earnings compared to a net tax benefit of million recorded in the year ended december  as a result of the reduction of the valuation allowance pertaining to our net operating loss carryforward in that year 
net cash used in operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to assets  net of cash  acquired from tiernan communications in the amount of million 
in addition  we had current year additions to fixed assets of million compared to million during we derived net cash from financing activities of  million and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash from financing activities was generated primarily through the exercise of stock options and stock purchased through our employee stock purchase plan which provided proceeds of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash from financing activities was generated primarily through a public offering  which generated cash of million  net of offering costs 
the exercise of warrants  which were issued in connection with the public offering  provided additional proceeds of million 
these proceeds were partially offset by payments made on our line of credit of million 
during the year ended december   net cash from financing activities was composed primarily of million from proceeds obtained through the sale of common stock and million from line of credit borrowings  offset by million in repayments of loans from affiliates and million in repayments of other notes 

table of contents in addition  we have secured a committed line of credit with a bank in the amount of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit 
our future debt and lease obligations are summarized by year as follows in thousands debt minimum lease total cash maturities commitments obligations thereafter total we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand  anticipated future cash receipts  and borrowings available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
however  a decrease in our sales or demand for our products or services would likely affect our working capital amounts 
as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
these potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which  in turn  may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there are no assurances that we will be able to consummate any of these transactions

impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or expenses during the last five fiscal periods reported on herein 
accounting matters in july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  sill continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of statement statement requires  upon adoption of statement  that we evaluate our existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform 
table of contents with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  we will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  we will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  statement will require us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption  we expect to have unamortized goodwill of approximately million  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately  for the year ended december  we are evaluating these recently issued accounting standards 
however  due to their complexity we are unable to determine the ultimate impact on our consolidated financial statements at this time 
on october   the fasb issued statement no   accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while statement no 
supercedes statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
statement no 
also supercedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions  the fasb has enhanced management s ability to provide information that helps financial statement users to assess the effects of a disposal transaction on the ongoing operations of an entity 
statement no  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at the current time  management does not believe that the adoption of this statement on january  will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk on our financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments 
as of december   a change in interest rates would  over a year s period  have a potential pretax impact of  on our interest earnings  which is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements
