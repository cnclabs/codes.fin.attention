revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to the products being sold transfers to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
inventories inventories are comprised of material  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million and million at august  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets other intangible assets  consisting primarily of purchased patents  trademarks and noncompete agreements  are amortized over periods from three to twenty five years

fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline is due to the impact of businesses divested in fiscal and reduced sales in most of the tools supplies distribution channels  offset by increased sales to the recreational vehicle rv market due to higher demand and the march  acquisition of dewald 
excluding the results of divested businesses  total net sales increased million  or  but decreased million if the impact of currency rate changes on translated results is excluded 
poor economic conditions  which began in the summer of and continued into fiscal and  were exacerbated by the terrorist actions in the united states on september  although the terrorist actions and poor economic conditions adversely impacted sales to our tools supplies customers  the terrorist actions may have contributed to the increased engineered solutions sales  especially rv sales  as consumers preferred to travel closer to home via land transport instead of air transportation 
excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  tools supplies net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decline 
this decline was driven by weaker economic conditions in north america and the negative impact of the september  terrorist actions 
sales in our more capital intensive distribution channels  sales to the electrical distribution market and sales to oems declined more than other markets in fiscal european and asian revenues comprised the remainder of the decrease  which was partially offset by million of favorable currency impact on translated results 
engineered solutions net sales  excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is attributable to a increase in sales to the rv market due to higher demand  the incremental impact of a full year of dewald sales and a million favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes on translated results 
partially offsetting this  were decreases in demand from our medical  global truck and off highway customers due to poor economic conditions 
dewald s sales for the two fiscal quarters prior to our mid fiscal acquisition were approximately million 
fiscal compared to fiscal total net sales decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the majority of this decline is due to the impact of businesses divested in fiscal after removing the impact of the divestitures  net sales decreased million  or 
this decrease results from the negative impact of currency rate changes on translated results of million and slower economic conditions  which impacted many of our businesses 
sales to rv  automotive and truck oems  as well as the construction and diy markets  were all lower than in fiscal due to recessionary trends that began in the summer of fiscal excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  tools supplies net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decline 
the negative impact of currency on translated results accounted for million of the million reduction  with the remainder being caused by generally weak economic conditions 
engineered solutions net sales  excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  declined million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal foreign currency rate changes caused million of the decrease 
sales to the rv industry decreased million  which is comprised of a decline of million in power gear rv sales  offset by million of sales from dewald  an rv business we acquired at the beginning of the third quarter 
rv industry demand was negatively impacted by weak economic conditions  as well as surplus finished goods inventory at oems 
sales to automotive and truck manufacturers declined million due to automotive model changeovers and generally less favorable economic conditions in fiscal gross profit the following table summarizes gross profit and gross profit margins for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions gross profit by segment tools supplies less non continuing t s businesses 
adjusted tools supplies engineered solutions less non continuing es businesses adjusted engineered solutions total gross profit less non continuing businesses total adjusted gross profit gross profit margins by segment tools supplies adjusted tools supplies engineered solutions adjusted engineered solutions total gross profit margin total adjusted gross profit margin fiscal compared to fiscal total gross profit decreased million  or  from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to reduced sales volumes resulting from divestitures 
excluding non continuing businesses  gross profit declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  with tools supplies gross profit declining and engineered solutions gross profit increasing due to lower and higher sales volumes  respectively 
gross profit margins declined slightly due to the unfavorable mix resulting from the growth in our engineered solutions business and contraction in our tools supplies business 
engineered solutions margins were reduced due to the inefficiencies following rv plant consolidation activities  the impact of a full year of dewald s lower margins  and increased engineering development and prototype costs for our new convertible top business 
the gross margin increase in the tools supplies business was driven by a focused effort to reduce costs 
gross profit decreased million  or  in the tools supplies business  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the non continuing tools supplies business  gross profit decreased million  or from fiscal to fiscal  due to the reduced tools supplies sales 
gross profit margins  however  improved to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal significant cost reduction efforts have been made in the hydraulic and electrical tools businesses  resulting in material cost reductions  personnel reductions  and facility downsizing 
these cost reductions come in large part from a formal cost reduction program implemented in the tools supplies business in mid fiscal that is now being implemented across all actuant businesses 
engineered solutions fiscal gross profit decreased million  or from fiscal excluding the non continuing businesses  however  gross profit increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal as a result of the increased sales to the rv market 
adjusted gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to ineffeciencies related to the consolidation of our rv manufacturing facilities  lower fixed cost absorption at our more vertically integrated milwaukee cylinder and nielsen sessions operations due to lower sales and production levels  and higher prototype costs in the automotive operations to support new platform development 
in addition  fiscal includes a full year of sales from dewald which historically had lower margins than our existing rv business 
fiscal compared to fiscal total gross profit decreased million  or  from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to reduced sales volumes resulting from divestitures and weaker economic conditions 
excluding non continuing businesses  gross profit declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit margins declined due to an unfavorable change in sales mix to lower margin businesses such as dewald and the unfavorable currency impact on products produced in the united states and sold in europe 
these declines were partially offset by improved margins in the electrical tools and supplies business due to cost reductions 
gross profit decreased million  or  in the tools supplies business  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the non continuing tools supplies business  gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit margins improved to in fiscal the gross profit decrease is due to the corresponding decrease in net sales levels 
the gross profit margin increase is due to cost reduction efforts in fiscal engineered solutions fiscal gross profit decreased from fiscal as a result of divestitures  lower sales levels and sales mix 
excluding the non continuing businesses  gross profit decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal adjusted gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is largely due to increased sales from lower margin businesses  such as dewald 
as a result of reduced rv slide out and leveling systems sales in fiscal due to lower demand  our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs declined  adversely impacting gross profit margins in power gear 
in addition to reduced gross profit margins in power gear  margins have declined in our more vertically integrated businesses  nielson sessions and milwaukee cylinder  as sales have declined due to the economic slowdown 
operating expenses the following table summarizes operating expenses for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions operating expenses selling  administrative and engineering expenses amortization of intangible assets corporate reorganization expense restructuring charge totaling operating expenses selling  administrative and engineering sae expenses the following table summarizes our sae expenses for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions sae expenses by segment tools supplies less non continuing t s businesses 
adjusted tools supplies engineered solutions less non continuing es businesses adjusted engineered solutions combined segment sae expenses general corporate expenses total sae expenses less non continuing businesses total adjusted sae expenses all of the general corporate expenses incurred by actuant corporation are included in sae expenses 
no portion of such expenses has been allocated to the two business segments or to the electronics business financial results  which are included in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal total sae expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sae expenses from the non continuing businesses and lower corporate expenses comprised million and million of the decrease  respectively 
adjusted sae in the tools supplies business decreased as a result of the cost reduction efforts while adjusted engineered solutions sae increased due to the inclusion of a full year s sae costs for dewald  non accruable costs associated with the rv plant consolidation activities  and higher automotive engineering development costs 
sae expenses in the tools supplies business decreased million to million in fiscal the non continuing tools supplies business comprised million of the decline  with the remainder resulting from reduced variable sae due to the reduced sales levels and the cost reduction efforts implemented during fiscal and sae expenses in the engineered solutions business increased million to million in fiscal excluding the impact of the non continuing businesses  sae costs increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sae costs in the engineered solutions business were significantly influenced by the inclusion of a full year of sae costs for dewald which was acquired on march   non accruable costs associated with the consolidation of the rv production facilities  and a high level of engineering development costs related to convertible top actuation for new automotive program wins 
fiscal compared to fiscal total sae expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was due to the elimination of sae costs incurred by businesses divested in fiscal and the reduction in general corporate expenses discussed above  offset by increases in sae costs in both of our business segments 
sae expenses for the tools supplies segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the segment s non continuing businesses  sae expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is a result of higher levels of information technology costs associated with a new business software system and increased marketing spending for tradeshows and promotions 
engineered solutions sae expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the impact of the segment s non continuing businesses  sae expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is due to a million recovery recorded in fiscal on a customer contract termination for which million was initially expensed in fiscal  higher spending on new platform development costs associated with the convertible top product line and the inclusion of sae expenses from dewald  which was acquired on march  amortization of intangible assets the following table summarizes amortization of intangible assets for the past three fiscal years year ended august  in millions total amortization expense less non continuing businesses total adjusted amortization expense the decrease in amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to ceasing goodwill amortization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this change in accounting principle 
the decrease in amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal primarily resulted from the divestiture of the barry controls and air cargo equipment business units during fiscal corporate reorganization expense operating expenses for fiscal include a million pre tax charge for investment banking  legal  accounting and other fees and expenses associated with the distribution 
restructuring charges the company adopted plans to restructure portions of its operations during the fiscal third quarter of these plans were designed to reduce administrative and operational costs and resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
of the charge  million related to the consolidation of the rv slide out production facilities  million related to downsizing the cable tie production facility  and million related to other personnel reductions 
the company wrote down the fixed assets at the locations to be closed or downsized to their fair value  less costs to sell 
in addition  the company eliminated approximately positions 
in fiscal  the company received net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of a former rv slide out manufacturing facility 
as of august   all restructuring initiatives contemplated by these plans have been completed 
other expense income net financing costs net financing costs from continuing operations decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to the combined result of lower market interest rates and reduced debt levels 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further information regarding the composition of our debt and deleveraging 
net financing costs from continuing operations increased to million in fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the company s financing costs was a result of higher interest rates and debt levels as a result of the distribution 
for example  the company s senior subordinated notes carry a interest rate compared to under the prior financing agreements 
during fiscal  these cost increases were partially mitigated as the company benefited  on its variable rate debt  from interest rate reductions in the marketplace 
loss gain on sale of businesses during fiscal the company sold its mox med business 
cash proceeds from the sale were approximately million  which resulted in a net gain of million  million after tax  or per diluted share 
in august  the company completed the sale of norelem  sa  a product line in the enerpac business which makes and distributes mechanical workholding products 
norelem  sa had annual sales of approximately million 
the cash proceeds were approximately million and resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million 
other income expense  net other income expense  net are comprised of the following year ended august  in thousands gain on insurance recovery gain loss on qmc divestiture  net present value of idled lease  net foreign currency transaction gain  other other income expense  net income tax expense the company s income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  and our ability to utilize various tax credits 
our effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to ceasing the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  most of which was not deductible for income tax purposes  and lower overall effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for fiscal was consistent with that in fiscal for more information regarding the variations in our effective tax rates for the periods presented  see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations see note  distribution and discontinued operations and note  contingencies and litigation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the results of our discontinued operations 
on november   apw ltd

was included in the company s consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation 
after discussions with apw ltd 
and an analysis of the restated financial statements  the company has determined that the effect on the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended august  and was not material and  therefore  does not require adjustment of the company s consolidated financial statements 
extraordinary items in fiscal and  the company recognized extraordinary losses  net of income taxes  of million and million  respectively  related to the early extinguishment of debt 
see note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million at august  and  respectively 
at august  the company held approximately million of funds that relate to apw 
see note  distribution and discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a majority of these funds were used to reduce debt under the senior secured credit facility 
our goal is to maintain low cash balances  utilizing any excess cash to pay down debt in an effort to minimize financing costs 
since the distribution on july   the company has reduced its indebtedness from approximately million to approximately million as of august  this approximate million reduction was accomplished as follows business divestitures  net of income taxes proceeds from accounts receivable securitization debt reduction from equity offering proceeds dewald acquisition cash related to discontinued operations free cash flow from operations and other total debt reduction the company generated cash from operating activities of continuing operations of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal operating cash flows are less than those in fiscal because the prior year operating cash flows include the proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program of million  fiscal includes the receipt of million of tax refunds  interest payments on the senior subordinated notes the notes were million higher than in fiscal since only nine months of interest was paid in fiscal versus twelve months in fiscal and interest was due on the notes that were repurchased in the fourth quarter  and income tax and transaction costs of approximately million were paid in fiscal related to the august sale of mox med 
cash provided by continuing operations increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the discontinuance of the previous accounts receivable securitization program in fiscal prior to the distribution  the subsequent sale of receivables in fiscal pursuant to the new securitization program  and the tax refunds received in fiscal cash flows from operating activities of discontinued operations were million in fiscal since the distribution  the company has focused on improving working capital management 
its metric to track such performance is primary working capital as a percentage of trailing day sales pwc as a percentage of sales 
primary working capital equals inventory plus accounts receivable before securitization less trade accounts payable 
at the time of the distribution  the company s pwc as a percentage of sales was approximately 
at the end of fiscal  the percentage was reduced to approximately 
this reduction was accomplished through a focus on negotiating cost reductions from vendors  extending payment terms with vendors and better diligence in making collection calls on outstanding receivables 
cash provided by used in investing activities of continuing operations was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal cash flows consisted of million of capital expenditures and the payment of the deferred purchase price related to the dewald acquisition  partially offset by million of proceeds on the sale of fixed assets and million of recoveries under an insurance settlement 
fiscal cash flows consisted of million of capital expenditures and million of cash paid for acquisitions  offset by million of proceeds on the sale of fixed assets  million of insurance proceeds and million of cash proceeds from business unit divestitures 
fiscal cash flows consisted primarily of capital expenditures and cash used by discontinued operations offset by cash proceeds of from business unit divestitures 
cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as described below  fiscal cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the proceeds of the equity offering and senior secured credit facility refinancing  offset by debt repayments on both the notes and the senior secured credit facility and the payment of the redemption premiums on the notes 
fiscal cash flows primarily reflect net debt repayments 
fiscal cash flows primarily reflect net debt repayments  debt financing costs  early extinguishment fees  and cash used by discontinued operations 
the company issued  shares of previously unissued shares of class a common stock in february for per share the equity offering 
cash proceeds from the equity offering  net of underwriting discounts  were approximately million 
the primary objectives of the equity offering were to redeem million of the notes prior to the april expiration of the optional redemption provision  reduce overall debt to improve financial stability and flexibility  increase the float of the company s common stock in the capital markets  and increase the awareness of actuant corporation among united states investors 
see note  debt and note  capital stock in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the equity offering 
proceeds from the equity offering were utilized as follows in thousands net cash proceeds  debt retirement notes  debt retirement senior secured credit facility  redemption premium on notes  accrued interest on notes  transaction expenses in march  the company used the proceeds from the equity offering to redeem million of the notes and pay down million of debt under the senior secured credit facility 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company refinanced a portion of the senior secured credit facility to generate million in annual interest savings 
in conjunction with the refinancing  all outstanding tranche b institutional term loans were extinguished and million of new tranche a term loans were funded by existing bank lenders 
at august   million of new tranche a term loans  with a final maturity in june  remained outstanding  bearing interest at libor plus 
such borrowing costs were reduced to libor plus in early october due to the improvement in our leverage ratio 
the term loans are subject to a pricing grid  which allows for further increases or decreases in the spread depending on the company s leverage ratio 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company retired an additional million of its notes by acquiring them through open market purchases 
as a result  the company recorded a pre tax extraordinary charge of million  or million after tax  for the million bond redemption premium payment and the million write off of the associated debt discount and debt issuance costs

see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company leases certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  the company pays the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable the company to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
future obligations under non cancelable operating leases in effect at august  are as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million thereafter 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as discussed in note  distribution and discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is contingently liable for certain lease agreements held by apw 
if apw were unable to fulfill its obligations under the leases  the company could be liable for such leases 
the future breach of the lease agreements by apw could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
as more fully discussed in note  accounts receivable financing in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to an accounts receivable securitization arrangement 
trade receivables sold and being serviced by the company were million and million at august  and august   respectively 
if the company were to discontinue this securitization program  at august  it would have been required to borrow approximately million to finance the working capital increase 
no dividend payments were declared or made during fiscal  nor does the company expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
cash flow will instead be retained for working capital needs  acquisitions  and to reduce outstanding debt 
at august   the company had approximately million of availability under its revolver 
the company s senior credit agreement contains customary limits and restrictions concerning investments  sales of assets  liens on assets  interest and fixed cost coverage ratios  maximum leverage  capital expenditures  acquisitions  excess cash flow  dividends  and other restricted payments 
at august  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
for a summary of the company s financing arrangements and borrowings outstanding at august   see note  debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to our agreement with apw regarding the million of offset funds  which is described in note  distribution and discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company will be required to pay an estimated to million to apw or other third parties as distribution related contingencies are resolved 
we estimate that these payments will be made sometime between fiscal and fiscal  which payment will be funded by availability under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations 
in addition  cash outflows will be required in fiscal and beyond to fund the remaining kopp ag purchase price and restructuring cash flow requirements 
see subsequent event below 
the primary focus of the company since the distribution has been to reduce debt 
while the company intends to continue to use available cash flow to reduce debt  cash may also be utilized to fund internal growth programs and acquisitions 
the company believes that availability under its credit facilities  plus funds generated from operations  will be adequate to meet its operating  debt service and capital expenditure requirements 
subsequent event on september   the company acquired heinrich kopp ag kopp 
kopp  headquartered in kahl  germany  is a leading provider of electrical products to the german home center retail market 
in the transaction  the company acquired approximately of the outstanding equity of kopp for approximately million including the assumption of debt and acquired cash 
the company was also granted an option to acquire  and the sellers were granted a put option to sell  the remaining outstanding equity commencing in october for approximately million 
the transaction was funded by borrowings under existing credit agreements and will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
neither the results of operations or the balance sheet of kopp are included in the company s historical results contained herein 
seasonality and working capital since the distribution  we have met our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under revolving credit facilities 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
the largest single customer generated approximately  and of fiscal  and net sales  respectively 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing operations consist of the assembly of components that are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
historical capital expenditures were as follows year ended august  in millions total capital expenditures less capital expenditures for non continuing businesses adjusted capital expenditures capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
for the past three fiscal years  capital expenditures were invested primarily in machinery and equipment and computer systems 
fiscal capital expenditures were higher than the previous two fiscal years due to capital spending required as a result of the february fire at our plant in oldenzaal  the netherlands and higher spending relating to new automotive production lines to support our new convertible top business 
there are no significant capital programs planned in the near future that would require expenditures in excess of the average capital expenditure levels over the past three years 
raw material costs and inflation no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations 
we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
the provisions of sfas no

the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  and will be adopted by the company effective september  the company is currently reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the impact on its results of operations and financial condition 
however  the company believes losses incurred in connection with the early retirement of debt will no longer be classified as extraordinary items 
as required by sfas no 
 prior year financial statements will require reclassification 
outlook including the september  acquisition of heinrich kopp ag discussed in note  subsequent event  to the company s consolidated financial statements  but excluding any future acquisitions or divestitures  we believe our revenues for fiscal will range from million to million  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda will range from million to million  and diluted earnings per share will range from to 
these estimates are dependent on  among other things  general economic and market conditions during fiscal  foreign exchange and interest rates remaining at their present levels  and the successful integration of the kopp acquisition

as a result  significant volumes of finished goods are manufactured in countries for sale into those markets 
for goods purchased from our other affiliates  we denominate the transaction in the functional currency of the producing operation 
we have adopted the following guidelines to manage our foreign exchange exposures i increase the predictability of costs associated with goods whose purchase price is not denominated in the functional currency of the buyer  ii minimize the cost of hedging through the use of naturally offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  netting  and pooling  and iii where possible  sell product in the functional currency of the producing operation 
our identifiable foreign exchange exposures result primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers along with the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
we periodically identify areas where we do not have naturally offsetting positions and then may purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
there are no such hedging instruments in place at august  or through the date of this filing 
our financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables  receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk from changes in interest rates 
we have periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
at august  we were a party to three interest rate swap agreements 
together  two of these swap contracts convert million of the company s floating rate debt  issued pursuant to the senior credit agreement  to fixed rate debt 
a third swap contract converts million of fixed rate senior subordinated debt to a variable rate 
at august   the aggregate fair value of these contracts was approximately million 
our senior credit agreement stipulates that the lower of of our total debt or million be fixed interest rate obligations 
we are in compliance with this requirement
