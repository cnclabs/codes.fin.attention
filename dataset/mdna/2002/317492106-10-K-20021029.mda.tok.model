management estimated the allowance based on various factors as described in the receivable portfolio and asset quality section herein 
salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of marketing and administrative employees  salary increases and additional costs incurred due to the increase in the level of problem accounts in fiscal due to the weak economy 
problem accounts are defined as customers that the company has incurred legal and or other costs in its collections efforts

interest expense  incurred on borrowings used to fund finance receivables  increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in average debt outstanding in fiscal from fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates incurred on the million increase in fixed rate term debt since april  net finance income before provision for possible losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in the yield on finance receivables  partially offset by higher rates incurred on the additional million of fixed rate term debt 
the provision for possible losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the provision for possible losses is determined by the amount required to increase the allowance for possible losses to a level considered appropriate by management 
salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of marketing and administrative employees  salary increases and  to a lesser extent  additional costs incurred relating to the increased number of problem accounts 
in addition  the company relocated its phoenix  arizona operations center to irvine  california in fiscal the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
net earnings increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal and basic earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the increase in diluted earnings per share was lower than the increase in net earnings primarily due to the effect that the convertible notes have on the diluted earnings per share calculation and the increase in the average price of the company s common stock in fiscal from fiscal the increase in basic earnings per share was lower than the increase in net earnings primarily due to the increase in the number of outstanding shares of the company s common stock resulting from the exercise of the company s million warrants in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the company repurchased million principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes for million 
excluding the net after tax gain on this retirement of debt  net earnings increased by  diluted earnings per share increased by and basic earnings per share increased by in fiscal from fiscal receivable portfolio and asset quality finance receivables outstanding increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july   as the amount of finance receivables originated exceeded amounts collected 
finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and investments in direct financing leases 
at july   loans totaled billion  or of finance receivables  and leases totaled million  or of finance receivables 
the company s leasing activities are similar in business terms to its lending and financing activities  differing only in legal and tax treatment 
a transaction is documented as a lease based on management s evaluations of the customer s credit and the equipment collateral  the customer s preference and other factors 
the types of equipment that the company lends against  finances and leases  and the ongoing operational treatment of a transaction  are generally the same  regardless of the documentation used 
the company accounts for all transactions as finance receivables 
the company has an allowance for possible losses on finance receivables on its balance sheet 
the purpose of the allowance is to account for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date 
losses are recorded when management has reason to expect that all amounts contractually due will not be collected from the combination of the obligor lessee  any guarantor and the sale of any collateral repossessed by the company 
management increased the allowance for possible losses in fiscal by million to million at july  from million at july  primarily due to the growth in finance receivables 
the allowance level was of finance receivables at july  and management periodically reviews the allowance to determine that it is at the appropriate level 
the allowance is a significant estimate that management determines based on total finance receivables  net credit losses  the level of delinquencies and its current assessments of the risks inherent in the company s finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of counterparties includes the obligor lessee and other parties the company may have recourse to such as equipment vendors manufacturers and owners affiliates of the obligor lessee  equipment collateral values and other factors 
changes in the level of the allowance may be necessary based on unexpected changes in these factors 
the equipment collateral securing the company s finance receivables generally possess certain characteristics that have mitigated potential credit losses 
the equipment collateral typically has an economic life that exceeds the term of the transaction  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in multiple industries  ease of access and transporting  and a broad  established resale market 
the company also does not finance high risk  big ticket items such as aircraft and railcars nor does the company finance soft collateral such as computer related equipment  fixtures and telecommunications equipment 
non performing assets increased by to million of total finance receivables at july  from million of total finance receivables at july  non performing assets at july  include million of total finance receivables of finance receivables classified as non accrual income recognition has been suspended and million of total finance receivables of assets received to satisfy finance receivables 
delinquent finance receivables transactions with a contractual payment more than days past due increased by to million of total finance receivables at july  from million of total finance receivables at july  at july   approximately half of the company s non accruing finance receivables were not delinquent 
net credit losses write downs of receivables less subsequent recoveries incurred on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net credit losses  expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables outstanding loss ratio  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal non performing assets  delinquent finance receivables and net credit losses increased during fiscal primarily due to the weak domestic economy 
a weak economy increases the possibility that customers will pay late  stop paying  declare or be forced into bankruptcy or liquidate their businesses and also causes collateral values to decline 
continued weakness in the economy could result in additional increases in the levels of non performing assets  delinquent finance receivables and net credit losses 
increases in net credit losses would have a negative effect on earnings through additional increases in the provision for possible losses 
increases in non performing assets would have a negative effect on earnings by reducing revenue 
although non performing assets  delinquent receivables and net credit losses have increased and could continue to increase  their current and expected levels are below current and historical industry experience 
finance receivables reflect certain industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations arise from counterparties having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
at july   the major industry concentrations are construction related  road transportation  manufacturing and waste services 
the regional geographic concentrations are southeast  northeast  southwest  west and central 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and growth are dependent upon the continued availability of funds needed to originate or acquire finance receivables  to purchase portfolios of finance receivables and to repay maturing debt 
the company may obtain required funds from a variety of sources  including operating cash flow  dealer placed and directly issued commercial paper  borrowings under committed unsecured revolving credit facilities  private and public issuances of term debt  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables and sales of common and preferred equity 
management believes that the company s sources of liquidity are well diversified 
as such  the company is not dependent on any single funding source or on any single credit provider 
management believes  but cannot assure  that sufficient liquidity is available to the company to support its future operations and growth 
the company s bank credit facilities  asset securitization facility and senior term notes were obtained through financial federal credit inc credit 
credit s senior term notes are rated bbb by fitch  inc fitch and credit s commercial paper is rated f by fitch 
these credit ratings provide the company with greater access to capital markets 
fitch reported in july that its ratings outlook for the company is stable 
credit s debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants including limitations on its indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to its parent  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
the company has decreased its dependence on short term unsecured debt during fiscal and short term unsecured debt was  and of total debt at july   and  respectively 
this percentage should decline further in fiscal total debt increased by million  or  to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity increased by million  or  to million at july  from million at july  as a result  leverage debt to equity ratio decreased to at july  from at july  the increases in debt and equity  combined with increases in other liabilities  were used primarily to fund the increase in finance receivables 
senior term notes in july  the company closed a million private placement with ten insurance companies 
the company received million in july and received the remaining million in august the company used the july proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities and used the august proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities and commercial paper 
the placement includes million of fixed rate and million of floating rate unsecured senior notes due at maturity as follows million in july and august  million in july and august and million in july and august  respectively 
in september  the company repaid million of term debt at maturity with proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities 
at july   million remained available for future issuances of term notes under the company s september medium term note program 
at july   the company had million of senior term notes outstanding comprised of million of private placements with insurance companies and million of bank term loans 
the senior term notes  including the million received in august  have a weighted average maturity of years and are due as follows in millions fiscal bank credit facilities at july   the company had million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from thirteen banks a decrease of million from july  
of this amount  million had original terms ranging from two to five years and million had original terms of one year or less 
at july   million and million were outstanding under the multi year and one year facilities  respectively  with maturities of one to eight days 
these facilities range in size from million to million 
the multi year facilities expire as follows in millions fiscal during fiscal  the company obtained million of additional credit facilities from three banks and renewed million of credit facilities with seven banks 
also  million of credit facilities from six banks expired in fiscal at july   the company had a commitment to obtain two new credit facilities from a bank totaling million 
these facilities provide the company with a dependable  low cost source of funds and support for its commercial paper program 
the company can borrow the full amount under each facility 
none of the credit facilities are for commercial paper back up only 
commercial paper the company issues commercial paper directly and through credit s million program 
the company s commercial paper is unsecured and matures within days 
the company has not obtained commitments from any purchaser of its commercial paper for additional or future purchases 
increases in commercial paper are generally offset by decreases in bank and other borrowings  and vice versa 
commercial paper outstanding at july  was million  an increase of million from the million outstanding at july  the company s current policy is to maintain committed revolving credit facilities from banks so that the aggregate amount available thereunder exceeds commercial paper outstanding 
information on the combined amounts of commercial paper and bank borrowings follows in millions fiscal maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year outstanding at year end asset securitization financings in december  the company obtained million from the second transaction under its asset securitization facility established in july the company used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities 
the company structured the terms of the facility so that any securitization proceeds obtained would be classified as debt by the company and not as sales of receivables for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  the company has not recorded any gains on sales of securitized receivables 
at july   the company had million of asset securitization financings accounted for as secured borrowings that are included in senior debt in its july  consolidated balance sheet 
the terms of the securitization facility limit the amount that the company can borrow to a minimum level of securitized receivables 
when borrowings exceed the minimum level  the company has the option to repay the excess or to securitize additional receivables 
the company can securitize additional receivables during the term of the facility 
the facility expires january  the company currently intends to renew the facility for another year 
upon the expiration of the facility  the company has the option to repay borrowings outstanding or to convert them into term debt 
the term debt would be repaid monthly in amounts equal to the collections of securitized receivables 
currently  the company would exercise the conversion option 
based on the contractual payments of securitized receivables at july   the term debt would be fully repaid by november credit s unsecured senior debt agreements limit the amount of finance receivables that it can securitize to of its finance receivables outstanding 
at july   credit could securitize million  or an additional million 
the amount that credit can borrow under the securitization facility is limited to of securitized receivables 
in august  the company completed its third asset securitization financing transaction obtaining million 
the company used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities and commercial paper 
convertible notes in july  the company called all million of its convertible notes for redemption 
the company called the notes because they were an expensive form of financing considering their dilution and their cost relative to current market interest rates 
the company also had the resources to do so from the aforementioned recent debt transactions 
the redemption was completed in august  million of the notes were redeemed for cash with proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities and million of the notes were converted into million shares of the company s common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
the company paid a million prepayment premium equal to of the notes redeemed for cash 
the redemption of the notes will have a positive impact on the diluted earnings per share calculation resulting from the elimination of their dilutive effect and the conversion of the notes will have a negative impact on the basic earnings per share calculation resulting from the increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding 
also  leverage will decline to below as a result of the conversion

the following table was depicted as a pie chart in the printed material 
senior term notes asset securitization financings commercial paper borrowings under bank credit facilities market interest rate risk and sensitivity the company s earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates and the prime rate 
changes in these rates affect the company s finance income and interest expense 
generally  based on the current mix of fixed rate and floating rate finance receivables and debt  increases in rates would have a negative impact on earnings  and decreases in rates would have a positive impact on earnings because the company has more floating rate and short term debt than fixed rate term debt  and more fixed rate finance receivables than floating rate finance receivables 
as a result  when market interest rates rise  the company s borrowing costs would increase faster than the yield on its finance receivables 
conversely  when market interest rates decline  the company s borrowing costs would decrease faster than the yield on its finance receivables 
these broad statements do not take into account the effects of other economic conditions that could accompany interest rate fluctuations 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market interest rate fluctuations through risk management procedures that may include using certain derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and changing the proportion of its fixed rate term debt versus its floating rate and short term debt 
the company may use certain derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on certain debt obligations 
the company does not use derivatives for speculation and the company does not trade derivatives 
the company did not have any derivative positions at july   although the company may enter into interest rate swaps and locks and other derivative financial instruments in the future 
the net yield of finance receivables less the weighted average cost of borrowed funds represents the net interest spread  an important measure of a finance company s profitability 
the net interest spread for the last three fiscal years follows years ended july  net yield of finance receivables weighted average cost of borrowed funds net interest spread the increase in the net interest spread in fiscal and resulted from the precipitous decline in market interest rates starting in january  leaving rates at their lowest levels in over forty years at july  the net interest spread  at july   should decline in fiscal as older fixed rate finance receivables  with rates above current market rates  continue to be collected and new finance receivables are booked at current lower rates 

line graph omitted 
at july   billion  or  of finance receivables were fixed rate and million  or  of finance receivables were indexed to the prime rate 
finance receivables generally have original maturities ranging from two to five years and provide for monthly installments 
the company experiences some prepayments on its finance receivables that accelerate the scheduled maturities 
at july   million of fixed rate finance receivables are scheduled to mature within one year and the weighted average remaining maturity of fixed rate finance receivables is years 
at july   fixed rate term debt totaled million excludes the million of convertible notes that were redeemed for cash in august  or of total debt outstanding 
the company s other debt at july   comprising commercial paper  bank borrowings  asset securitization financings and floating rate term loans  reprices as follows million  or  within one month  million  or  within the following two months and the remainder  million  or  within the following six months 
fixed rate term debt of million and stockholders equity of million totaled million at july  due to the significant amount of fixed rate finance receivables above this amount  the net interest spread would be affected by fluctuations in market interest rates 
the company does not match the maturities of its debt to its finance receivables 
management periodically calculates the effect on net earnings of a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in market interest rates 
at july   such a hypothetical increase in rates would reduce annual net earnings by approximately million and would reduce the net interest spread by approximately basis points to 
the basis point increase is of the weighted average interest rate on the company s short term and floating rate debt at july  the calculated reduction in net earnings assumes the occurrence of an adverse change in market interest rates 
actual future changes in market interest rates may differ materially and their effect on net earnings may also differ materially due to changes in finance receivable and debt repricing structures 
the calculation also does not take into account other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point increase in market interest rates

as a result of the rescission of sfas no 
 the million loss that the company incurred on the redemption of its convertible notes in august will be reported as a separate line item included in operating income instead of an extraordinary item net of income taxes 
the fiscal  gain on debt retirement was not classified as an extraordinary item and therefore did not need to be reclassified as a result of the adoption of sfas no
