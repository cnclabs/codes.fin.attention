item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
overview we were formed in september as prison realty corporation and commenced operations on january   following our mergers with each of old cca on december  and old prison realty on january   which are collectively referred to herein as the merger 
as more fully discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  effective october   we completed a series of previously announced restructuring transactions 
as part of the restructuring  our primary tenant  operating company  was merged with and into our wholly owned operating subsidiary on october  this merger is referred to herein as the operating company merger 
in connection with the restructuring and the operating company merger  we amended our charter to  among other things  remove provisions relating to our operation and qualification as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year and change our name to corrections corporation of america 
as more fully discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements  effective december   each of the service companies  known herein individually as pmsi and jjfmsi  also merged with and into our wholly owned operating subsidiary 
as the result of the operating company merger and the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi  we now specialize in owning  operating and managing prisons and other correctional facilities and providing inmate residential and prisoner transportation services for governmental agencies 
in addition to providing the fundamental residential services relating to inmates  our facilities offer a variety of rehabilitation and educational programs  including basic education  life skills and employment training and substance abuse treatment 
these services are intended to help reduce recidivism and to prepare inmates in the facilities we operate for their successful reentry into society 
we also provide health care including medical  dental and psychiatric services  food services and work and recreational programs 
our results of operations for reflect our operating results as a reit 
we believe the comparison between and prior years is not meaningful because the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows reflect our operation as a subchapter c corporation  which  for the period january  through september   included real estate activities with operating company during a period of severe liquidity problems  and as of october   also includes the operations of the correctional and detention facilities previously leased to and managed by operating company 
in addition  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows as of and for the year ended december  also include the operations of pmsi and jjfmsi as of december  acquisition date on a consolidated basis 
for the period january  through august   the investments in pmsi and jjfmsi were accounted for and presented under the equity method of accounting 
for the period from september  through november   the investments in pmsi and jjfmsi were accounted for on a combined basis with the results of our operations due to the repurchase by the wholly owned subsidiaries of pmsi and jjfmsi of the non management  outside stockholders equity interest in pmsi and jjfmsi during september for these reasons  we believe the comparison between the results of operations for the year ended 
table of contents december  and the results of operations for periods prior to the restructuring in the fourth quarter of is not meaningful  as the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows reflect our operations for a full year as an owner  operator and manager of prisons and other correctional facilities  while the financial statements do not reflect such results 
since the merger and through september   we specialized in acquiring  developing and owning correctional and detention facilities 
operating company was a private prison management company that operated and managed the substantial majority of the facilities we owned 
as a result of the merger and certain contractual relationships with operating company  we were dependent on operating company for a significant source of our income 
in addition  we were obligated to pay operating company for services rendered to us in the development of our correctional and detention facilities 
as a result of certain liquidity issues  the parties amended the contractual agreements during for a more complete description of the historical contractual relationships and of these amendments  see note to the accompanying financial statements 
as required by our governing instruments  we operated and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes with respect to our taxable year ended december  in connection with the completion of the restructuring  on september   our stockholders approved an amendment to our charter to remove the requirements that we elect to be taxed and qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year 
accordingly  with respect to our taxable year ended december  and thereafter  we have operated and are taxed as a subchapter c corporation 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements 
the significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following asset impairments 
as of december   we had approximately billion in long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our long lived assets  other than intangibles  when events suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
in these circumstances  we utilize estimates of undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairments 
as of december   we had approximately million in goodwill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to amortization  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value based approach 
we will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of during  we will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  we have not yet determined what effect  if any  applying those tests will have on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets become impaired 

table of contents income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period 
since the change in tax status in connection with the restructuring in  and as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance to reserve the deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the valuation allowance was recognized based on the weight of available evidence indicating that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
this evidence primarily consisted of  but was not limited to  recurring operating losses for federal tax purposes 
our assessment of the valuation allowance could change in the future 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of removal 
to the extent no reserve is established for our deferred tax assets  the financial statements would reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes 
as further discussed in note to our financial statements  we have received the irs s preliminary findings related to audits of old cca s federal tax returns for the taxable years ended december  and  in which the irs has proposed to increase taxable income by approximately million 
if ultimately upheld  these adjustments would result in a cash tax liability to us of approximately million  not including penalties and interest 
we are currently appealing the irs s preliminary findings with the appeals office of the irs 
while we intend to vigorously defend our position  we are currently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these irs audits 
it is possible  however  that future cash flows could be materially affected by claims against us  and results of operations could be materially affected by claims against us in excess of reserves currently recorded 
in addition  to the extent that any irs audit adjustments increase the accumulated earnings and profits of old cca  we could be required to make additional distributions of such to our stockholders  either in cash or through the issuance of certain types of our securities  in order to preserve our reit status for our taxable year 
if the irs ultimately upholds the adjustments described above and requires us to distribute the full amount of the increase in old cca s earnings and profits less any taxes  interest and penalties paid by us  we would be required to distribute approximately million in cash or securities to our stockholders of record at the time of distribution  none of which is currently accrued 
pursuant to the terms of our senior bank credit facility  however  we would not be permitted to satisfy any such obligation with cash 
self funded insurance reserves 
as of december   we had approximately million in accrued liabilities for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile insurance 
we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance 
as such  our insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims experience 
we have consistently accrued the estimated liability for employee health based on our history of claims experience and time lag between the incident date and the date the cost is reported to us 
we have accrued the estimated liability for workers compensation and automobile insurance based on a third party actuarial valuation of the outstanding liabilities 
these estimates could change in the future 

table of contents legal reserves 
as of december   we had approximately million in accrued liabilities for litigation 
as further discussed in note to our financial statements  we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims based on a range of potential outcomes 
in addition  we are subject to current and potential future legal proceedings for which little or no accrual has been reflected because our current assessment of the potential exposure is nominal 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with inside legal counsel and  if applicable  outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december  as of december   our liquidity was provided by cash on hand of approximately million and million available under a revolving credit facility with a million capacity which was assumed in connection with the operating company merger 
during the year ended december   we generated million in cash through operating activities 
as of december   we had a net working capital deficiency of million 
contributing to the net working capital deficiency was the classification of the outstanding balance of million under our senior bank credit facility  which matures on december   as current  along with the estimated negative fair value of an interest rate swap agreement  which also expires on december   of million 
we do not have sufficient working capital resources or any other ability to satisfy amounts outstanding under our senior bank credit facility without extending or refinancing the senior bank credit facility  and expect to refinance the senior bank credit facility during on a longer term basis 
the estimated negative fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the cost we would incur to terminate the interest rate swap agreement on december  since we do not expect to terminate the interest rate swap agreement prior to its maturity on december   unless the interest rate swap agreement is terminated in connection with a refinancing of the senior bank credit facility  the negative fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is expected to reverse into earnings prior to the maturity date without any impact on our cash flows 
however  until the maturity date  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement could result in additional non cash charges or gains 
our principal capital requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt maturities 
capital requirements may also include cash expenditures associated with our outstanding commitments and contingencies  as further discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
during  we made cash payments in excess of million  and have committed to pay an additional million  in settlement of our stockholder litigation  our dispute with fortress blackstone and claims against us by merrill lynch 
we may be required to use significant capital resources for other litigation in the future 
in addition  we may incur capital expenditures to expand the design capacity of our facilities in order to retain management contracts 
we have financed  and intend to continue to finance  the working capital and capital expenditure requirements with existing cash balances  net cash provided by operations  and borrowings under the operating company revolving credit facility 
in addition  as a result of a change in tax law that became effective march   permitting an extension of the carryback period of net operating losses from two years to five years  we will be due an income tax refund of approximately million 
the refund results from net operating losses experienced in that can be carried back to and this refund will provide us with additional liquidity 

table of contents we currently expect to be able to meet our cash expenditure requirements and extend or refinance our debt maturities  including primarily the senior bank credit facility  due within the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or refinance such debt 
if we are unable to extend or refinance the debt maturity on december   we currently do not have sufficient working capital or any other ability to satisfy this obligation 
as a result of our current financial condition  including i the loans under the senior bank credit facility maturing december   ii our negative working capital position  and iii our highly leveraged capital structure  we continue to evaluate our current capital structure  including the consideration of various potential transactions that could improve our financial position 
following the completion of the operating company merger and the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi  during the fourth quarter of  our new management conducted strategic assessments  developed a strategic operating plan to improve our financial position  developed revised projections for  evaluated the utilization of existing facilities  projects under development and excess land parcels  and identified certain non strategic assets for sale 
during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of one of these assets  a facility located in spruce pine  north carolina  for approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we completed the sale of our interest in our agecroft facility located in salford  england  for approximately million  and an additional facility located in bayboro  north carolina for a sales price of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we also completed the sale of a facility located in las vegas  nevada for a sales price of approximately million 
the proceeds from the sales of these four correctional facilities provided us with additional liquidity  which was used to pay down outstanding balances under the senior bank credit facility  significantly improving our leverage ratios 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our interest in two international subsidiaries  an australian corporation  corrections corporation of australia pty  ltd  and a company incorporated in england and wales  uk detention services limited  for an aggregate sales price of million 
as a result of these sales  we own or operate only correctional and detention facilities located in the united states and puerto rico 
our debt agreements include covenants that restrict our ability to enter into certain types of transactions and require us to meet certain financial covenants 
our debt covenants also include restrictions on the use of our liquidity 
under terms of an amendment to our senior bank credit facility in june  we were prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends with respect to our outstanding series a preferred stock until such time as we raised at least million in equity 
dividends with respect to the series a preferred stock continued to accrue under the terms of our charter 
during the third quarter of  however  we received a consent and waiver to the senior bank credit facility  which allowed us to declare a dividend on shares of the series a preferred stock 
on september   our board of directors declared a cash dividend on the shares of series a preferred stock for the first quarter of previously accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares  payable on october  to the holders of record of our series a preferred stock on october  approximately million was paid on october  as a result of this dividend 
in addition  as described below  as a result of an amendment and restatement of the senior bank credit facility  we are now permitted to pay quarterly dividends with respect to our series a preferred stock  as and when declared by our board of directors  including dividends in arrears 
during the first and second quarters of  we obtained amendments to the senior bank credit facility to modify the financial covenants to take into consideration any loss of ebitda that may result from certain asset dispositions during and subsequent periods  to permit the issuance of indebtedness in partial satisfaction of our obligations in the stockholder litigation settlement  and to change the consummation date for securitizing the lease payments or other similar transaction 
table of contents related to our agecroft facility 
also  during the first quarter of  we amended the provisions of the note purchase agreement governing our million convertible subordinated notes to replace previously existing financial covenants in order to remove existing defaults and attempt to remain in compliance during and subsequent periods 
we also have certain non financial covenants that must be met in order to remain in compliance with our debt agreements  including a requirement to complete the securitization of lease payments or other similar transaction with respect to the agecroft facility which was completed in april and the delivery of audited financial statements 
during  we obtained waivers of these covenants  which cured a resulting cross default under our million convertible subordinated notes 
the senior bank credit facility also required us to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete a capital raising event on or before june  a capital raising event is defined in the senior bank credit facility as any combination of the following transactions  which together would result in net cash proceeds of at least million an offering of our common stock through the distribution of rights to our existing stockholders  any other offering of our common stock or certain types of our preferred stock  issuances of unsecured  subordinated indebtedness providing for in kind payments of principal and interest until repayment of the senior bank credit facility  or certain types of asset sales  including the sale leaseback of our corporate headquarters  but excluding the securitization of lease payments or other similar transaction with respect to the agecroft facility 
the senior bank credit facility also contains limitations upon the use of proceeds obtained from the completion of such transactions 
we had considered a distribution of rights to purchase common or preferred stock to our existing stockholders  or an equity investment from an outside investor 
however  we determined that it was not commercially reasonable to issue additional equity or debt securities  other than those securities for which we had already contractually agreed to issue  including primarily the issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the settlement of our stockholder litigation 
further  as a result of our restructuring during the third and fourth quarters of  prior to the completion of the audit of our financial statements and the filing of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  with the sec on april   we were unable to provide the sec with the requisite financial information required to be included in a registration statement 
therefore  even if we had been able to negotiate a public or private sale of our equity securities on commercially reasonable terms  our inability to obtain an effective sec registration statement with respect to such securities prior to april  would have effectively prohibited any such transaction 
moreover  the terms of any private sale of our equity securities likely would have included a requirement that we register with the sec the resale of our securities issued to a private purchaser thereby also making it impossible to complete any private issuance of its securities 
due to the fact that we would have been unable to obtain an effective registration statement  and therefore  would have been unable to make any public issuance of our securities or any private sale that included the right of resale  any actions prior to april  to complete a capital raising event through the sale of equity or debt securities would have been futile 
although we would technically have been able to file a registration statement with the sec following april   we believe that various market factors  including the depressed market price of our 
table of contents common stock immediately preceding april   the pending reverse stock split required to maintain our continued nyse listing  and the uncertainty regarding the maturity of the revolving loans under the senior bank credit facility  made the issuance of additional equity or debt securities commercially unreasonable 
because the issuance of additional equity or debt securities was deemed unreasonable  we determined that the sale of assets represented the most effective means by which we could satisfy the covenant 
as discussed above  during the first and second quarters of  we completed the sale of our mountain view correctional facility for approximately million and our pamlico correctional facility for approximately million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we also completed the sale of our southern nevada women s correctional facility for approximately million  and are actively pursuing the sales of additional assets 
as a result of the foregoing  we believe we demonstrated commercially reasonable efforts to complete the million capital raising event as of june  under terms of an amendment and restatement of the senior bank credit facility obtained in december  as further described below  our obligation to complete the capital raising event was removed 
as part of our plans to improve our financial position and address the january  maturity of portions of the debt under the senior bank credit facility  during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan of disposal for certain additional long lived assets 
during  we paid down million in total debt through a combination of million in cash generated from asset sales and internally generated cash 
additionally  we are currently holding assets for sale with an aggregate carrying value of million 
although there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the sale of any assets  including those currently held for sale  we may pursue the sale of additional assets 
we expect to use anticipated proceeds from any such future asset sales to pay down additional amounts outstanding under the senior bank credit facility 
we believe that utilizing sale proceeds to pay down debt and the generation of million of operating income during has improved our leverage ratios and overall financial position  which has improved our ability to renew and refinance maturing indebtedness 
during december  we completed an amendment and restatement of our existing senior bank credit facility 
as part of the december amendment and restatement  the existing million revolving portion of the senior bank credit facility  which was to mature on january   was replaced with a term loan of the same amount maturing on december   to coincide with the maturity of the other loans under the senior bank credit facility 
pursuant to terms of the december amendment and restatement  all loans under the senior bank credit facility bear interest at a variable rate of over libor  or over the base rate  at our option  through june  following june   the applicable interest rate for all loans under the senior bank credit facility will increase to over libor  or over the base rate  at our option 
in the event we are unable to refinance the entire senior bank credit facility prior to july   we will be required to pay the lenders under the facility an additional fee equal to of the amounts then outstanding under the senior bank credit facility 
as a result of the december amendment and restatement  certain financial and non financial covenants were amended  including the removal of prior restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on shares of our issued and outstanding series a preferred stock 
under the terms of the december amendment and restatement  we are permitted to pay quarterly dividends  when declared by the board of directors  on the shares of series a preferred stock  including all dividends in arrears 
on december   our board of directors declared a cash dividend on the shares of series a preferred stock for the period from october  through december  and for all 
table of contents five quarters then unpaid and in arrears  payable on january  to the holders of record of series a preferred stock on december  as a result of the board s declaration  we paid an aggregate of million to shareholders of the series a preferred stock in january we believed  and continue to believe  that a short term extension of the revolving portion of our senior bank credit facility was in our best interests for a longer term financing strategy  particularly due to difficult market conditions for the issuance of debt securities following the terrorist attacks on september   and during the fourth quarter of additionally  we believed that certain terms of the amendment and restatement  including primarily the removal of prior restrictions to pay cash dividends on our shares of series a preferred stock  including all dividends in arrears  would result in an improvement to our credit ratings  enhancing the terms of a more comprehensive refinancing 
further  we believe that the successful pursuit of additional transactions that would not be completed by january   such as the sale of additional assets and a potential contract award from the federal bureau of prisons for  inmates under the bop s criminal alien requirement ii  or car ii  could improve the terms of a more comprehensive refinancing 
after completing the amendment and restatement of the senior bank credit facility in december  moody s investors service upgraded the rating on our senior secured debt to b from b  our senior unsecured debt to b from caa  and our preferred stock to caa from ca 
we have prepared financial projections for  which indicate we will continue to remain compliant with our debt covenants 
in addition  we continue to pursue additional asset sales and contract awards 
based upon these additional factors  we have begun pursuing alternatives to refinance the senior bank credit facility scheduled to mature december  we believe that we will be able to complete a refinancing of our senior bank credit facility during the first half of through senior secured bank debt or through a combination of senior secured bank debt and senior unsecured debt even without the sale of additional assets or the bop contract award 
the combination and amount of short term bank debt and senior unsecured debt with longer term maturities  however  will be somewhat dependent upon market conditions and the outcome of our discussions with the bop regarding a potential sale of our northeast ohio correctional center  as well as the potential award of car ii 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to meet our financial projections for  sell additional assets  obtain a new contract from the bop or complete a refinancing of our senior bank credit facility prior to its maturity on december   on commercially reasonable or any other terms 
unsuccessful attempts to refinance the senior bank credit facility  or events of default which result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding debt  would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position 
we do not have sufficient working capital resources to satisfy our debt obligations in the event we cannot complete a refinancing prior to december  we believe that we are currently in compliance with the terms of the covenants on all of our indebtedness 
further  we believe our operating plans and related projections are achievable and will allow us to remain in compliance with our debt covenants during however  there can be no assurance that the cash flow projections will reflect actual results  and there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants or that  if we default under any of our debt covenants  we will be able to obtain waivers or amendments 
due to certain cross default provisions contained in certain of our debt instruments  if we were to be in default under the senior bank credit facility and if the lenders under the senior bank credit facility elected to exercise their rights to accelerate our obligations under the senior bank credit facility  such events could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of our million senior notes and our aggregate million convertible subordinated 
table of contents notes  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position 
additionally  under our million convertible subordinated notes  even if the lenders under the senior bank credit facility did not elect to exercise their acceleration rights  the holders of the million convertible subordinated notes could require us to repurchase such notes upon a default under the senior bank credit facility permitting acceleration 
we do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million 
this amount represents net income for the year plus depreciation and amortization  changes in various components of working capital and adjustments for various non cash charges  including primarily the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement 
during  we received significant tax refunds of approximately million  contributing to the net cash provided by operating activities 
these refunds  however  were partially offset by the payment of million during august for a full settlement of all claims in a dispute regarding the termination of a securities purchase agreement in related to our proposed corporate restructuring led by the fortress blackstone investment group 
investing activities our cash flow provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily attributable to the proceeds received from the sales of the mountain view correctional facility on march   our interest in the agecroft facility on april   the pamlico correctional facility  on june   and the southern nevada women s correctional center on october  financing activities our cash flow used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  net payments on debt totaled million and primarily represents the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the mountain view correctional facility  our interest in the agecroft facility  the pamlico correctional facility  and the southern nevada women s correctional center that were immediately applied to amounts outstanding under the senior bank credit facility 
in addition  during june we paid down a lump sum of million on the senior bank credit facility with cash on hand 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december  a substantial portion of our revenue during was derived from i rents received under triple net leases of correctional and detention facilities  including the leases with operating company  referred to herein as the operating company leases  ii dividends from investments in the non voting stock of certain subsidiaries  iii interest income on a million promissory note payable to us from operating company  referred to herein as the operating company note  and iv license fees earned under the terms of a trade name use agreement with operating company 
operating company leased of our operating properties pursuant to the operating company leases 
we  therefore  were dependent for our rental revenue upon operating company s ability to make the lease payments required under the operating company leases for such facilities 
operating company had incurred a net loss of million as of december  and had net working capital deficiencies 
as a 
table of contents result  during  operating company was unable to pay the first scheduled interest payment under the terms of the operating company note and the scheduled lease payments to us under the operating company leases 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   used net cash of million in operating activities and had a net working capital deficiency of million at december  included in the million net loss for the year ended december   was a million non cash impairment loss associated with the reduction of the carrying values of certain long lived assets to their estimated fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  referred to herein as sfas contributing to the net loss and net working capital deficiency was an accrual at december  of million related to the settlement of our stockholder litigation which would be satisfied through the issuance of million shares of common stock  as adjusted for the reverse stock split in may  and the issuance of an aggregate million note payable due in  strategic investor and merger related charges of million  and million of amounts written off under lease arrangements 
in june  we obtained a waiver and amendment to the senior bank credit facility and waivers and amendments to our convertible subordinated notes to permit the operating company merger and the amendments to the operating company leases and the other contractual arrangements we had with operating company 
at september   we were not in compliance with certain applicable financial covenants contained in the senior bank credit facility  including i debt service coverage ratio  ii interest coverage ratio  iii leverage ratio  and iv net worth 
we subsequently obtained a consent and amendment  effective november   to the senior bank credit facility thereby avoiding an event of default under the facility 
in an effort to address the liquidity needs of operating company prior to the completion of the restructuring  and as permitted by the terms of the june waiver and amendment  we amended the terms of our leases with operating company in june as a result of this amendment  lease payments under the operating company leases were due and payable on june and december of each year  instead of monthly 
in addition  we agreed to defer  with interest  and with the exception of certain scheduled payments  the first semi annual rental payment under the revised terms of the operating company leases  due june   until september  in connection with the amendments to the operating company leases  deferring a substantial portion of the rental payments due to us thereunder  the terms of the june waiver and amendment also conditioned its effectiveness upon the deferral of our payment of fees to operating company which would otherwise be payable pursuant to the terms of certain agreements  including the amended and restated tenant incentive agreement  the business development agreement  and the amended and restated service agreement  each as further described in note to the financial statements 
immediately prior to the operating company merger  we entered into agreements with operating company pursuant to which we forgave all unpaid amounts due and payable to us through august   totaling approximately million  relating to the operating company leases  the interest due on the unpaid operating company leases  and the interest accrued on the operating company note 
as a result of the operating company merger  the operating company leases  the amended and restated tenant incentive agreement  the business development agreement  and the amended and restated services agreement were canceled 

table of contents during  we recognized rental income  net of reserves  from operating company based on the actual cash payments received 
in addition  we continued to record our obligations to operating company under the various agreements discussed above through the effective date of the operating company merger 
as of december   our liquidity was provided by cash on hand of approximately million and million available under the operating company revolving credit facility 
at december   borrowings outstanding under the revolving loans of the senior bank credit facility  which were scheduled to mature january   totaled million 
as a result of our financial condition at december   including i the revolving loans under the senior bank credit facility maturing january   ii the requirement under a consent and amendment to the senior bank credit facility completed in november to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete any combination of certain transactions  as defined therein  which together result in net cash proceeds of at least million  iii our negative working capital position  and iv our highly leveraged capital structure  we evaluated our capital structure and considered various potential transactions that could improve our financial position 
during the third quarter of  we named a new president and chief executive officer  followed by a new chief financial officer in the fourth quarter 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held during the fourth quarter of  the stockholders elected a newly constituted nine member board of directors  including six independent directors 
following the completion of the operating company merger and the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi during the fourth quarter of  our new management conducted strategic assessments  developed a strategic operating plan to improve our financial position  developed revised projections for  and evaluated the utilization of existing facilities  projects under development  excess land parcels  and identified certain of these non strategic assets for sale 
as a result of these assessments  we recorded non cash impairment losses totaling million 
during the fourth quarter of  we obtained a consent and amendment to our senior bank credit facility to replace existing financial covenants 
during the first quarter of  we also obtained amendments to the senior bank credit facility to modify the financial covenants to take into consideration any loss of ebitda that may result from certain asset dispositions during and subsequent periods and to permit the issuance of indebtedness in partial satisfaction of our obligations in the stockholder litigation settlement 
also  during the first quarter of  we amended the provisions to the note purchase agreement governing our million convertible subordinated notes to replace previously existing financial covenants in order to remove existing defaults and attempt to remain in compliance during and subsequent periods 
operating activities our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   was million  and represented the net loss for the year plus depreciation and amortization  changes in various components of working capital and adjustments for various non cash charges  including primarily impairment losses and the write off of amounts under lease arrangements  included in the statement of operations 
investing activities our cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  additions to property and equipment totaling million in were primarily related to 
table of contents expenditures associated with two   bed medium security prisons under construction in georgia 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the reduction of restricted cash that had been used as collateral for an irrevocable letter of credit issued in connection with the construction of a facility 
in addition  in connection with the operating company merger and the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi  we acquired approximately million in cash 
financing activities our cash flow used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  net proceeds from the issuance of debt totaled million and was used primarily to fund additions to property and equipment and working capital needs  partially offset by million used to pay debt issuance costs 
on march   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on our series a preferred stock of per share to preferred stockholders of record on march  these dividends totaling million were paid on april  during the first quarter of  we also paid the accrued distributions as of december   on the company s series a preferred stock  totaling million 
the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  includes certain transactions by pmsi and jjfmsi prior to their acquisition on december  in september  a wholly owned subsidiary of pmsi purchased of the outstanding voting common stock of pmsi for total cash consideration of million 
also in september  a wholly owned subsidiary of jjfmsi purchased of the outstanding common stock of jjfmsi for total cash consideration of million 
these transactions are included in purchase of treasury stock in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows for results of operations as previously discussed  we do not believe the comparison between the results of operations for the years ended december   and are meaningful 
please refer to the discussion under the overview of the company for further information on the lack of comparability of the results of operations between the years 
year ended december  we generated net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  contributing to the net income was a non cash gain of million related to the extinguishment of the promissory note issued in connection with our federal stockholder litigation settlement 
results also included the non cash effect of an million charge associated with the accounting for interest rate swap agreements into which we were required to enter under prior terms of the senior bank credit facility 
facility operations a key performance indicator we use to measure the revenue and expenses associated with the operation of the facilities we own or manage is expressed in terms of a compensated man day  and represents the revenue we generate and expenses we incur for one inmate for one calendar day 
during  we generated in revenue per compensated man day  and incurred in operating expenses per compensated man day  resulting in an operating margin of 

table of contents the operation of the facilities we own carries a higher degree of risk associated with a management contract than the operation of the facilities we manage but do not own because we incur significant capital expenditures to construct or acquire facilities we own 
additionally  correctional and detention facilities have a limited or no alternative use 
therefore  if a management contract is terminated on a facility we own  we continue to incur certain operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  that we would not incur if a management contract were terminated for a managed only facility 
as a result  revenue per compensated man day is typically higher for facilities we own and manage than for managed only facilities 
revenue per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage was for revenue per compensated man day for the managed only facilities was for because we incur higher expenses such as repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance on the facilities we own and manage  our cost structure for facilities we own and manage is also higher than the cost structure for the managed only facilities 
operating expense per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage was for operating expense per compensated man day for the managed only facilities was for operating margins  therefore  for owned and managed facilities and managed only facilities were and  respectively 
management and other revenue 
management and other revenue consists of revenue earned from the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities we own or manage  which  for the year ended december   totaled million 
occupancy for the facilities we operate was for the year ended december   including for facilities we own and manage  and for our managed only facilities 
during the first quarter of  the state of georgia began filling two of our facilities that had been expanded during to accommodate an additional beds at each facility  contributing to an increase in management and other revenue at these facilities 
during the second quarter of  we were informed that our current contract with the district of columbia to house its inmates at the northeast ohio correctional center  which expired september   would not be renewed due to a new law that mandated the bop to assume jurisdiction of all district of columbia offenders by the end of the northeast ohio correctional center is a  bed medium security prison 
the district of columbia began transferring inmates out of the facility during the second quarter  and completed the process in july 
accordingly  substantially all employees at the facility have been terminated 
total management and other revenue at this facility was approximately million during the related operating expenses at this facility were million during overall  our occupancy decreased by approximately  inmates at our facilities as a result of this mandate 
we have engaged in discussions with the bop regarding a sale of the northeast ohio correctional center to the bop  and are also pursuing agreements to reopen the facility  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreements on a sale or to reopen this facility 
during the third quarter of  due to a short term decline in the state of wisconsin s inmate population  the state transferred approximately inmates out of our whiteville correctional facility  located in whiteville  tennessee  to the state s correctional system 
therefore  management and other revenue declined at this facility during we are currently pursuing a contract with the state of tennessee to replace the vacancy from these inmates  although we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in this pursuit 
in late and early  we were provided notice from the commonwealth of puerto rico of its intention to terminate the management contracts at the ponce young adult correctional facility and the ponce adult correctional facility  located in ponce  puerto rico  upon the expiration of the 
table of contents management contracts in february although we continue to negotiate with respect to the continued operation of these facilities  we have begun a transition period to transfer operation of the facilities to the commonwealth of puerto rico 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue our operation of these facilities 
during  these facilities generated total revenue of million and total operating expenses of million 
the termination of the ponce adult correctional facility management contract would result in a non cash charge of approximately million for the write off of the carrying value of assets associated with this management contract 
we have recently signed an extension of our management contract with the commonwealth of puerto rico for the operation of the guayama correctional center located in guayama  puerto rico  through december however  the management contract is terminable at any time without cause by the commonwealth 
we have responded to a proposal from the bop for the placement of up to  inmates under the bop s car ii proposal 
we have earmarked our mcrae correctional facility located in mcrae  georgia  which has a design capacity of  beds  for this opportunity 
the bop has identified this facility as one of two preferred alternative sites to house inmates under car ii 
if we are successful in securing a contract under car ii  management and other revenue would increase at this facility upon commencement of the contract 
however  start up expenses expected to be incurred prior to the commencement of the contract  including but not limited to  salaries  utilities  medical and food supplies and clothing  would result in additional operating expenses before any revenue is generated  resulting in a reduction in net income in the short term 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing car ii  which is expected to be awarded during the first half of operating expenses 
operating expenses totaled million for the year ended december  operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of correctional and detention facilities and other correctional facilities 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of operating expenses 
during  we incurred wage increases due to tight labor markets  particularly for correctional officers 
however  as the unemployment rate has increased  we have seen an increase in the availability of potential employees  providing some moderation to the trend of increasing salary requirements 
nonetheless  the market for correctional officers has remained challenging 
in addition  ten of our facilities have contracts with the federal government requiring that our wage and benefit rates comply with wage determination rates set forth  and as adjusted from time to time  under the service contract act of the us department of labor 
our contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a portion of the increased costs resulting from wage determinations in the form of increased per diems  thereby mitigating the effect of increased salaries and benefits expenses at those facilities 
we may also be subject to adverse claims  or government audits  relating to alleged violations of wage and hour laws applicable to us  which may result in adjustments to amounts previously paid as wages and  potentially interest and or monetary penalties 
we also experienced a trend of increasing insurance expense during because we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance  our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims experience 
our insurance policies contain various deductibles and stop loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences 
however  the nature of our self insurance policies provides little protection for a deterioration in claims experience in general 
we continue to incur increasing insurance expense due to adverse claims experience 
we are developing a strategy to improve the management of our future loss claims but can provide no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
additionally  general liability insurance costs have 
table of contents risen substantially since the terrorist attacks on september  unanticipated additional insurance expenses resulting from adverse claims experience or a continued increasing cost environment for general liability insurance could result in increasing expenses in the future 
we were able to achieve reductions in food expenses during through the renegotiation of food service contracts 
in addition  despite increasing medical costs nationwide  we were able to achieve a modest reduction in medical expenses 
we can provide no assurance  however  that we will continue to achieve further expense reductions  or that we will not experience an increase in such expenses in the future 
rental revenue rental revenue was million for the year ended december   and was generated from leasing correctional and detention facilities to governmental agencies and other private operators 
on march   we sold the mountain view correctional facility  and on june   we sold the pamlico correctional facility  two facilities that had been leased to governmental agencies 
therefore  no further rental revenue will be received for these facilities 
for the year ended december   rental revenue for these facilities totaled million 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses totaled million 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense totaled million 
amortization expense for the year ended december  includes approximately million for goodwill that was established in connection with the acquisitions of operating company on october  and the service companies on december  goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization effective january   in accordance with a new accounting pronouncement  as further discussed under recent accounting pronouncements herein 
amortization expense during the year ended december  is also net of a reduction to amortization expense of million for the amortization of a liability relating to contract values established in connection with the mergers completed in due to certain of these liabilities becoming fully amortized during  we currently expect the corresponding amortization reduction to decrease during interest expense  net interest expense  net  is reported net of interest income for the year ended december  gross interest expense was million for the year ended december  gross interest expense is based on outstanding convertible subordinated notes payable balances  borrowings under the senior bank credit facility  the operating company revolving credit facility  our million senior notes  net settlements on interest rate swaps  and amortization of loan costs and unused facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year is primarily attributable to declining interest rates and lower amounts outstanding under the senior bank credit facility 
based on our credit rating  from january  through september   the interest rate applicable to the senior bank credit facility was over the base rate and over the london interbank offering rate  or libor  for revolving loans  and over the base rate and over libor for 
table of contents term loans 
these rates increased basis points on october  since  under terms of the senior bank credit facility  we had not prepaid an aggregate of million of the outstanding loans under the senior bank credit facility 
on december   pursuant to terms of the december amendment and restatement  the interest rate for all loans under the senior bank credit facility was adjusted to a variable rate of over libor  or over the base rate  at our option  through june   subject to an increase of on july  gross interest income was million for year ended december  gross interest income is earned on cash used to collateralize letters of credit for certain construction projects  direct financing leases  notes receivable and investments of cash and cash equivalents 
on october   we sold our southern nevada women s correctional facility  which had been accounted for as a direct financing lease 
therefore  no further interest income will be received on this lease 
for the year ended december   interest income for this lease totaled million 
subsequent to the sale  we continue to manage the facility pursuant to a contract with the state of nevada 
change in fair value of derivative instruments as of december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities referred to herein as sfas  as amended  we have reflected in earnings the change in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement during the year ended december  we estimate the fair value of interest rate swap agreement using option pricing models that value the potential for interest rate swap agreements to become in the money through changes in interest rates during the remaining terms of the agreements 
a negative fair value represents the estimated amount we would have to pay to cancel the contract or transfer it to other parties 
our swap agreement fixes libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of at least million through december  as of december   due to a reduction in interest rates since entering into the swap agreement  the interest rate swap agreement has a negative fair value of approximately million 
this negative fair value consists of a transition adjustment of million for the reduction in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement from its inception through the adoption of sfas on january   and a reduction in the fair value of the swap agreement of million during the year ended december  in accordance with sfas  we have recorded an million non cash charge for the change in fair value of the swap agreement for the year ended december   which includes million for amortization of the transition adjustment 
the transition adjustment represents the fair value of the swap agreement as of january   which has been reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change included in other comprehensive income in the accompanying statement of stockholders equity 
the unamortized transition adjustment at december  of million is expected to be included in earnings as a non cash charge  along with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity through accumulated comprehensive income  over the remaining term of the swap agreement 
the non cash charge of million for the year ended december   is expected to reverse into earnings through increases in the fair value of the swap agreement  prior to the maturity of the swap agreement on december   unless the swap is terminated in conjunction with a refinancing of the senior bank credit facility 
however  for each quarterly period prior to the maturity of the swap agreement  we will continue to adjust the swap agreement to its estimated fair value potentially resulting in additional non cash charges or gains 

table of contents additionally  during the fourth quarter of  a million promissory note was issued in connection with the final settlement of the federal court portion of the stockholder litigation settlement 
under terms of the promissory note  the note and accrued interest became extinguished in january once the average closing price of the common stock met or exceeded a termination price equal to per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the issuance of such note 
the terms of the note  which allow the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  create a derivative instrument that must be valued and accounted for under the provisions of sfas as a result of this extinguishment  we estimated the fair value of this derivative to approximate the face amount of the note  resulting in an asset being recorded in the fourth quarter of the derivative asset offsets the face amount of the note in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the state court portion of the stockholder litigation settlement has not yet been completed  however  the settlement is expected to result in the issuance of million additional shares of common stock and a million subordinated promissory note  which may also be extinguished if the average closing price of the common stock meets or exceeds per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the issuance of such note and prior to its maturity in the estimated liability is included in accrued expenses at december  since we have reflected the maximum obligation of the contingency associated with the state court portion of the stockholder litigation in the balance sheet as of december   the issuance of the note is currently expected to have a favorable impact on our financial position and results of operations initially  thereafter  the financial statement impact will fluctuate based on changes in our stock price 
however  the impact cannot be determined until the promissory note is issued and an estimated fair value of the derivative included in the promissory note is determined 
income tax expense we incurred approximately million of income tax expense for the year ended december   primarily consisting of taxes associated with our operations in puerto rico  partially offset by an income tax benefit for the reduction in our deferred tax liabilities 
as of december   our deferred tax assets totaled approximately million 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period 
since the change in tax status in connection with the restructuring in  and as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance to reserve the deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the valuation allowance was recognized based on the weight of available evidence indicating that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
this evidence primarily consisted of  but was not limited to  recurring operating losses for federal tax purposes 
our assessment of the valuation allowance could change in the future 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of removal 
to the extent no reserve is established for our deferred tax assets  our financial statements would reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes 
on march   the job creation and worker assistance act of was signed into law 
among other changes  the law extends the net operating loss carryback period to five years from two 
table of contents years for net operating losses arising in tax years ending in and  and allows use of net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards to offset of the alternative minimum taxable income 
we experienced net operating losses during resulting primarily from the sale of assets at prices below the tax basis of such assets 
under terms of the new law  we will be able to utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and as a result of this tax law change in  we will be due an income tax refund of approximately million  which will be reflected as an income tax benefit during the first quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  management revenue management revenue consisted of revenue earned from the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities for the year ended december   totaling million  which  beginning as of october  and december   included management revenue previously earned by operating company  pmsi and jjfmsi  respectively

as such  our results of operations reflected a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  however  due to our tax status as a real estate investment trust  we recorded no income tax provision or benefit related to operations for the year ended december  in connection with the restructuring  on september   our stockholders approved an amendment to our charter to remove provisions requiring us to elect to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes effective january  as a result of the amendment to our charter  we have been taxed as a taxable subchapter c corporation beginning with our taxable year ended december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we were required to establish current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in our financial statements in the period in which a change of tax status occurred 
as such  our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  included the provision associated with establishing the deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the change in tax status during the third quarter of  net of a valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas sfas addresses accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be subject to amortization  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value based approach 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is less than their carrying amounts and is recognized in earnings 
sfas also requires companies to disclose information about the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill  the carrying amount of intangible assets by major intangible asset class for those assets subject to amortization and those not subject to amortization  and the estimated intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years 
as of december   we had million of goodwill reflected on the accompanying balance sheet associated with the operating company merger and the acquisitions of the service companies completed during the fourth quarter of we do not have any intangible 
table of contents assets with indefinite useful lives 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  was million 
provisions of sfas are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  because goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized  the reported amounts of goodwill and intangible assets as well as total assets will not decrease at the same time and in the same manner as under previous standards 
there may be more volatility in reported income than under previous standards because impairment losses may occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
the impairment losses  if any  that arise due to the initial application of sfas resulting from a transitional impairment test applied as of january   will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
although the amount of impairment losses  if any  has not yet been determined  the initial application of sfas could have a material effect on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets referred to herein as sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas unlike sfas  however  an impairment assessment under sfas will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct adverse effect on our operations 
many of our management contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  which mitigates an adverse impact of inflation on net income 
however  a substantial increase in personnel costs  workers compensation or food and medical expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent that these expenses increase at a faster pace than the per diem or fixed rates we receive for our management services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in us interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound 
we are exposed to market risk related to our senior bank credit facility and certain other indebtedness 
the interest on the senior bank credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
if the interest rate for our outstanding indebtedness under the senior bank credit facility was basis points higher or lower during the year ended december  and  our interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  would have been increased or decreased by approximately million and 
table of contents million  respectively  including the effects of our interest rate swap arrangements discussed below 
as of december   we had outstanding million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of series a preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate of and million of series b preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate of 
because the interest and dividend rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
the senior bank credit facility required us to hedge million of our floating rate debt on or before august  we have entered into certain swap arrangements fixing libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of at least million through december  the difference between the floating rate and the swap rate is recognized in interest expense 
in accordance with sfas  as amended  as of december  we recorded a million liability  representing the estimated amount we would have to pay to cancel the contract or transfer it to other parties 
the estimated negative fair value of the swap agreement as of january  of million was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change included in other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
the reduction in the fair value of the swap agreement during the year ended december  was charged to earnings 
this decline in fair value is due to declining interest rates and is expected to reverse into earnings prior to the maturity of the swap on december   unless the swap is terminated in connection with a refinancing of the senior bank credit facility 
additionally  we may  from time to time  invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these investments 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our construction  development and leasing of our agecroft facility located in salford  england  which was sold in april we extended a working capital loan to the operator of this facility 
such payments to us are denominated in british pounds rather than the us dollar 
as a result  we bear the risk of fluctuations in the relative exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar 
at december   the receivables due us and denominated in british pounds totaled million british pounds 
a hypothetical increase in the relative exchange rate would have resulted in an increase of million in the value of these receivables and a corresponding unrealized foreign currency transaction gain  and a hypothetical decrease in the relative exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease of million in the value of these receivables and a corresponding unrealized foreign currency transaction loss
