overview we provide cost effective software based communications solutions that address high speed internet connectivity requirements for existing and emerging technologies 
our communications products enable internet access through pcs and alternative internet access devices 
our soft modem products consist of a hardware chipset containing a proprietary host signal processing software architecture which allows for the utilization of the computational and processing resources of a host central processor  effectively replacing special purpose hardware required in conventional hardware based modems 
together  the combination of the chipset and software drivers are a component part within a computer which allows for telecommunications connectivity 
by replacing hardware with a software solution  our host signal processing technology lowers costs while enhancing capabilities 
from our inception in february through the end of  we were a development stage company primarily engaged in product development  product testing and the establishment of strategic relationships with customers and suppliers 
from december  to december   our total headcount increased from to in  we reduced our headcount by through reductions in force 
as of december   our total headcount was we first recognized revenue on product sales in the fourth quarter of  and became profitable in  our first full year of product shipments 
revenues increased from million in to million in  million in and million in since the fourth quarter of  our customers  primarily our pc motherboard and distribution manufacturers  were impacted by significantly lower pc demand 
as a result  our revenues decreased to million in because we expect pc demand to continue to be weak for the foreseeable term  we expect our revenues and earnings to continue to be negatively affected 
we sell soft modems to manufacturers and distributors principally in asia through our sales personnel  independent sales representatives and distributors 
our sales to manufacturers and distributors in asia were  and of our total sales for the years ended  and  respectively 
the predominance of our sales is in asia because our customers are primarily motherboard and modem manufacturers  and the majority of these manufacturers are located in asia 
in many cases  our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards that they purchase from the board manufacturers  and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers  both in the united states and internationally 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of sales of products to oems and distributors 
revenues from sales to customers are recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss passes to the customers  unless we have future obligations or have to obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is not recorded until such obligations have been satisfied or customer acceptance has been achieved 
we provide for estimated sales returns and customer rebates related to sales to oems at the time of shipment 
customer rebates are recorded against receivables to the extent that the gross amount has not been collected by the end customer 
once the gross amount has been collected  the accrued customer rebate is then reclassified to liabilities 
as of december  and  we have an allowance for customer rebates against accounts receivable of  and million  respectively  and accrued customer rebates of million and  respectively  presented as current liabilities on the balance sheet 
accrued customer rebates will be paid to the customers  upon request  in the future unless they are forfeited by the customer 
revenues from sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing price protection and rights of return on unsold products 
we record revenue relating to sales to distributors only when the distributors have sold the product to end users 
customer payment terms generally range from letters of credit collectible upon shipment to open accounts payable days after shipment 
we also generate revenues from engineering contracts 
revenues from engineering contracts are recognized as contract milestones and customer acceptance are achieved 
royalty revenue is recognized when confirmation of royalties due to us is received from licensees 
furthermore  revenues from technology licenses are recognized after delivery has occurred and the amount is fixed and determinable  generally based upon the contract s nonrefundable payment terms 
to the extent there are extended payment terms on these contracts  revenue is recognized as the payments become due and the cancellation privilege lapses 
to date  we have not offered post contract customer support 
inventory reserves due to the changing market conditions  recent economic downturn and technological innovation  inventory valuation charges of million were recorded in the second half of given the volatility of the market  the age of the inventories on hand and the introduction of new products in  we wrote down excess inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and the firm purchase order commitments from our major suppliers 
of the million inventory valuation charges recorded  million is related to firm purchase order commitments and the remaining million is related to excess inventories on hand or disposed 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to the reserve for excess inventory  we also provide for an allowance against obsolete inventory 
as of december   there is an allowance for inventory obsolescence of million 
accrued royalties we record an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in our product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements and or ongoing royalties based upon our judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend our legal positions  and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
we have accrued our best estimate of the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements already signed  agreements that are in negotiation and unasserted but probable claims of others using advice from third party technology advisors and historical settlement rates 
as of december  and  we had accrued royalties of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  the amounts accrued may be inadequate and we will be required to take an immediate charge if royalty payments are settled at a higher rate than expected  or if we do not prevail in the litigation 
in addition  settlement arrangements may require royalties for both past and future sales of the associated products 
if this is the case  in addition to an immediate charge if our accrual is inadequate  our gross margins will decrease on these future product sales 
as a result of the litigation settlement with townshend  we made a cash royalty payment of million related to past liability and prepayment of future liabilities to townshend in march see discussion under contingencies in note for the impact of settlement on our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes we currently operate with subsidiaries in the cayman islands and japan as well as branch offices in taiwan  korea and france 
the complexities brought on by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably lead to an increased exposure to worldwide tax challenges 
should the tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes  our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
results of operations years ended december   and all amounts in tables  other than percentages  are in thousands revenues revenues    change from prior period our revenues primarily consist of product sales of soft modems to board manufacturers and distributors in asia 
revenues decreased million for the year ended december  from the revenue decrease was primarily attributable to less unit shipments as a result of an abnormally poor pc market due to poor economic conditions 
additionally  the decrease in sales revenues was due to downward pressure on average selling prices commonly seen in the industry 
our average selling prices decreased from to  mainly due to the downward pricing pressure which is commonly seen in the industry 
because we expect pc demand to continue to be weak for the foreseeable term  we expect our revenues to continue to be negatively affected in revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in these increases were attributable to increased units sold to tier one oems such as compaq corporation  intel corporation  fujitsu limited and nec corporation  and to a lesser extent  increased license revenues recognized during fiscal year the increase in sales volume was partly offset by downward pressure on average selling prices and sales discounts to customers 
gross profit gross profit    percentage of revenues change from prior period cost of revenues consists primarily of chipsets we purchase from third party manufacturers and also includes amortization of intangibles related to the csd acquisition  accrued intellectual property royalties  cost of operations  provision for inventory obsolescence and distribution costs 
provision for inventory losses are also included in the determination of gross profit 
gross profit decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year primarily due to decreased sales revenues and the provision for inventory losses of million recorded in the second half of gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  because of the provision for inventory losses and because average selling prices decreased faster than the rate of cost reduction 
in addition  the fixed portion of our costs as a percentage of revenue increased due to the decrease in revenues 
we expect the gross profit and gross margin as a percentage of revenue in to be higher than as we do not expect to record additional provision for inventory losses in and licensing royalty revenue as a percentage of revenues will be higher in as a result of the ess litigation settlement  offset by the continuing pressure for price decreases 
gross profit increased million for the year ended december  compared to due to increased volume  partially offset by a decline in the per unit average gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  because of a shift to higher volume  lower margin sales to oems and  generally  average selling prices decreased faster than the rate of cost reductions 
on the other hand  higher margin license revenues favorably impacted gross margins during the year  partially offsetting the decrease from average selling prices 
research and development research and development    percentage of revenues change from prior period research and development expenses include compensation costs for software and hardware development  prototyping  certification and pre production costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to as a result of the completion of certain projects and the reduction in headcount gradually through the year 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development increased for the year ended december  because of lower revenues in research and development headcount decreased from to from december  to december  we expect research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenues  to be lower in because of lower average headcount 
however  in the event that we decide to pursue new research and development opportunities  research and development expenses may increase in research and development expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to as we continued to invest heavily in the development of the g 
dmt  wireless and embedded modems  as well as a v 
upgrade 
sales and marketing sales and marketing    percentage of revenues change from prior period sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions and marketing costs 
sales commissions payable to our distributors are recognized when our products are sold through from the distributors to end users so that the commission expense is matched with related recognition of revenues 
marketing costs include promotional costs  public relations and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in spending reflects the reduction of sales and marketing personnel as a result of lower revenues and the reduction in force in sales and marketing headcount decreased from to from december  to december  we expect sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of revenues  to be lower in because of lower average headcount 
sales and marketing expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase reflects the increased costs to support higher sales and the addition of sales and marketing personnel to develop new accounts and drive new product development and product launches 
public relation costs  trade shows  press tours  sales programs  the production of collateral sales materials and travel costs also increased from general and administrative general and administrative    percentage of revenues change from prior period general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our general management and finance functions as well as professional service charges  such as legal  tax and accounting fees 
other general expenses include rent  insurance  utilities  travel and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to other functions 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to the increased legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation against smart link  ess and townshend 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will be significantly lower in as a result of reaching a settlement with smart link in and ess and townshend in early however  should any new litigation arise in  our legal costs and general and administrative expenses could significantly increase 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to our increase in staffing and related infrastructure to support our growth and the legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation against smart link and ess 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development  percentage of revenues upon completion of the voyager acquisition on february   we immediately expensed million representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the million expensed as in process research and development was approximately of the purchase price and was attributed and supported by a discounted cash flow analysis that identified revenues and costs on a project by project basis 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology  based on a percentage of completion discounted cash flow method  was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established 
the following in process projects existed at voyager as of the acquisition date bluetooth  homerf  direct sequence cordless  bluetooth homerf combo  bluetooth homerf direct sequence  wireless gas tank sensor  wireless gps and wireless industrial garage door opener projects 
the value of in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate includes a risk adjusted discount rate to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the risk adjusted discount rate applied to the projects cash flows was for existing technology and for the in process technology 
based upon assessment of each in process project s development stage  including relative difficulty of remaining development milestones  it was determined that application of a discount rate was appropriate for all acquired in process projects 
the valuation includes cash inflows from in process technology through with revenues commencing in and increasing significantly in before declining in the projected total revenue of voyager was broken down to revenue attributable to the in process technologies  existing technologies  core technology and future technology 
the revenue attributable to core technology was determined based on the extent to which the in process technologies rely on the already developed intellectual property 
the bluetooth and homerf projects were approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected timeframe for achieving these product releases was assumed to be in the second half of the direct sequence cordless project was approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected time frame for achieving this product release was assumed to be in the second half of the bluetooth homerf combo and bluetooth homerf direct sequence projects were approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected timeframe for achieving these product releases was assumed to be in the second half of and the first half of  respectively 
the wireless gas tank sensor and the wireless industrial garage door opener projects were approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected time frame for achieving these product releases was assumed to be the wireless gps was approximately complete at the time of the valuation and the expected time frame for achieving this product release was assumed to be in the second half of the percentage complete calculations for all projects were estimated based on research and development expenses incurred to date and management estimates of remaining development costs 
significant remaining development efforts were to be completed in the next to months in order for voyager s projects to become implemented in a commercially viable timeframe 
management s cash flow and other assumptions utilized at the time of acquisition did not materially differ from historical pricing licensing  margin  and expense levels of the voyager group prior to acquisition 
approximately million was attributed to core wireless technology and royalty revenue associated with the wireless water meter reading device project 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets   percentage of revenues on december   we completed the acquisition of bluecom 
the purchase price of bluecom was allocated based upon the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  which approximated book value 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  if the purchase price exceeds the net tangible assets acquired  the difference is recorded as excess purchase price 
in this circumstance  the difference was million which was attributed to goodwill  and a covenant not to compete 
we classified this balance of million as goodwill and other intangible assets  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were amortizing it over useful lives of two to five years prior to the impairment recorded in the quarter ended december  see below 
on february   we completed the acquisition of voyager 
the purchase price of voyager was allocated based upon the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  which approximated book value 
the acquisition was structured as a tax free reorganization and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  if the purchase price exceeds the net tangible assets acquired  the difference is recorded as excess purchase price 
in this circumstance  the difference was million 
we attributed million of the excess purchase price to in process research and development  which we expensed immediately  and the balance of million was attributed to intellectual property million  workforce million and goodwill million 
we classified this balance of million as goodwill and other intangible assets  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and were amortizing it over useful lives of five years prior to the impairment recorded in the quarter ended september  see below 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
s and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fair value based test 
effective january   existing goodwill will no longer be amortized 
additionally  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we will no longer amortize goodwill  thereby eliminating annual goodwill amortization of approximately  based on anticipated amortization for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  percentage of revenues in the second half of  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets  including intangibles  acquired from csd  voyager and bluecom  and recorded impairment charges totaling million 
due to the recent economic downturn  we determined that csd s estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of csd s long lived assets 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of csd s long lived assets  primarily goodwill  to their estimated fair value of approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the estimated fair value was based on anticipated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
in regards to the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from voyager  as a result of the recent corporate restructuring and reorganization  we determined that there are no future cash flows expected from this business 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we wrote off the carrying value of voyager s long lived assets  primarily goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
in regards to the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from bluecom  as a result of the recent corporate restructuring and reorganization  we determined that there are no future cash flows expected from this business 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off the carrying value of bluecom s long lived assets  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
restructuring charges restructuring charges  percentage of revenues on february   we announced a series of actions to streamline support for our voiceband business and sharpen our focus on emerging growth sectors 
these measures were part of a restructuring program to return the company to profitability and operational effectiveness and included a reduction in worldwide headcount of research and development employees  sales and marketing employees and general and administrative employees  a hiring freeze and cost containment programs 
on may   we announced a new business structure to provide greater focus on our activities with a significantly reduced workforce 
research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative positions were eliminated as part of this reorganization 
in the fourth quarter of  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative positions were eliminated to further focus our business 
in total  positions were eliminated during the year ended december  the restructuring resulted in million of charges for the year ended december   consisting of severance and employment related costs of million and costs related to closure of excess facilities of million as a result of the reduction in force 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation   percentage of revenues change from prior period  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering in  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million representing the difference between the exercise price and deemed fair value of our common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
in connection with the grant of restricted stock to employees in  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million representing the fair value of our common stock on the date the restricted stock was granted 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable shares 
subsequent to the issuance of the restricted stock  employee terminations resulted in the reversal of  from deferred stock compensation 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased  for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to the termination of employees in and the corresponding reversal of the remaining deferred stock compensation balance  offset by the additional expense related to the restricted stock grants in we expect the amortization of deferred stock compensation to decrease to approximately  per quarter through  based on restricted stock grants and stock option grants through december  the amortization of deferred stock compensation increased  for the year ended december  compared to because reflected a full year of amortization whereas reflected amortization from the date of grant  and there were more grants in the second half of in december  an employee and the company mutually agreed to rescind an option exercise to purchase  shares of common stock which occurred in january there was no effect on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  as a result of this rescission 
other income  net other income  net   percentage of revenues other income  net  consists of interest income  net of interest expense 
interest income is expected to fluctuate over time  depending on future interest rates 
other income  net  decreased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to the decrease in interest rates in other income  net  increased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to interest earned on the proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings and the elimination of interest expense on the loan used to acquire communications systems division 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes    during the third quarter of  we recorded million of provision for income taxes to establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes as a result of uncertainties regarding realizability 
after the establishment of the valuation allowances  we have  in remaining net deferred tax assets as of december  we had million in deferred tax assets as of december  our effective tax rate was below the statutory tax rate of due to international sales and profits through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which are taxed at rates below the statutory tax rate in the us extraordinary items on october   we retired million of notes payable with proceeds from the initial public offering 
in connection with the early retirement of debt  we incurred a million  net of taxes  extraordinary loss of prepayment penalties and the write off of deferred debt charges 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of year    working capital at the end of year    for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was the decrease in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of maturities and sales of short term investments of million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of  and purchases of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and shares issued through the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and working capital of million 
accounts receivable  as measured in days sales outstanding dso  was days at december  compared to days in december  the decrease in dso from december  to was primarily due to lower revenue in and the increased cash collection efforts throughout the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for compared to was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities for consisted of the acquisition of voyager technologies and bluecom technology of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of short term investments of million  offset by maturities and sales of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock associated with the secondary public offering and proceeds from stock option exercises and shares issued through the employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  consisting of cash  short term investments and cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital for the foreseeable future  after the million cash royalty payment to townshend discussed in note we will continue to evaluate opportunities for development of new products and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business 
we may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
however  possible investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  or cash settlements resulting from existing or new litigation  may require us to use our existing working capital or to seek additional financing 
in addition  if the current economic downturn prolongs  we will need to continue to expend our cash reserves to fund our operations 
as of december   we have outstanding firm inventory purchase order commitments with our major suppliers of million  of which million was accrued as inventory losses  and non cancelable operating leases for office facilities of million through recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect our business  financial condition and future operating results this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis  contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results  including those set forth below 
risks related to our business the recent economic slowdown  particularly the rapid deterioration in pc demand  makes it difficult to forecast customer demand for our products  and will likely result in excessive operating costs and loss of product revenues 
since the fourth quarter of  our customers  primarily our pc motherboard and distribution manufacturers  have been impacted by significantly lower pc demand 
as a result  our revenues and earnings in fiscal year of were negatively affected 
because we expect pc demand to continue to be weak for the foreseeable term  we expect our revenues and earnings to continue to be negatively affected 
in addition  the current economic environment also makes it extremely difficult for us to forecast customer demand for our products 
we must forecast and place purchase orders for specialized semiconductor chips several months before we receive purchase orders from our own customers 
this forecasting and order lead time requirement limits our ability to react to unexpected fluctuations in demand for our products 
these fluctuations can be unexpected and may cause us to have excess inventory or a shortage of a particular product 
during the second half of  due to the changing market conditions  recent economic downturn and technological innovation  a provision for inventory losses of million was charged against operations 
given the volatility of the market  the age of the inventories on hand and the introduction of a new products in  we wrote down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and firm purchase order commitments from our major suppliers 
of the million inventory valuation charges recorded  million is related to firm purchase order commitments with our major suppliers and the remaining million is related to excess inventory on hand or disposed 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations 
our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could cause our revenues to decrease 
our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers 
if we were to lose one or more of these customers  or if one or more of these customers were to delay or reduce purchases of our products  our sales revenues may decrease 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated by three of our customers  with one customer representing of revenues  another customer representing and a third customer representing of revenues 
these customers may in the future decide not to purchase our products at all  purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns  because we do not have any long term purchase arrangements or contracts with these or any of our other customers  our product sales to date have been made primarily on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice and without penalty  and many of our customers also have pre existing relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect our customers purchasing decisions 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next to months and that a significant portion of our sales will continue to be made on the basis of purchase orders 
our number of customers may be reduced in the future through mergers in the pc oem sector  such as hp and compaq 
continuing decreases in the average selling prices of our products could result in decreased revenues 
product sales in the connectivity industry have been characterized by continuing erosion of average selling prices 
price erosion experienced by any company can cause revenues and gross margins to decline 
the average selling price of our products has decreased by approximately from fiscal year to fiscal year we believe that the average selling price of our products is likely to continue to decline in the future due principally to competition pressure 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry standards in the soft modem industry is likely to further erode average selling prices  particularly for analog modems 
adoption of industry standards is driven by the market requirement to have interoperable modems 
end users need this interoperability to ensure modems from different manufacturers communicate with each other without problems 
historically  users have deferred purchasing modems until these industry standards are adopted 
however  once these standards are accepted  it lowers the barriers to entry and price erosion results 
decreasing average selling prices in our products could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units that we sell increases 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline 
our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and services  and these variations may hurt our net income 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from our software based connectivity products 
we expect margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products 
however  due in part to the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs  we expect margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time 
in addition  licensing revenues from our intellectual property historically have provided higher margins than our product sales 
changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues will cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in gross margins and net income 
we have significant sales concentrated in asia 
continued political and economic instability in asia and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable may make it difficult for us to maintain or increase market demand for our products 
our sales to customers located in asia accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  the predominance of our sales is in asia  mostly in taiwan and china  because our customers are primarily motherboard or modem manufacturers that are located there 
in many cases  our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers specify that our products be included on the modem boards or motherboards  the main printed circuit board containing the central processing unit of a computer system  that they purchase from board manufacturers  and we sell our products directly to the board manufacturers for resale to our indirect original equipment manufacturer customers  both in the united states and internationally 
due to the industry wide concentration of modem manufacturers in asia  we believe that a high percentage of our future sales will continue to be concentrated with asian customers 
as a result  our future operating results could be uniquely affected by a variety of factors outside of our control  including delays in collecting accounts receivable  which we have experienced from time to time  fluctuations in the value of asian currencies relative to the us dollar  which may make it more costly for us to do business in asia and which may in turn make it difficult for us to maintain or increase our revenues  changes in tariffs  quotas  import restrictions and other trade barriers which may make our products more expensive compared to our competitors products  and political and economic instability 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers 
our revenue depends on our ability to anticipate our customers needs and develop products that address those needs 
in particular  our success will depend on our ability to introduce new products for the wireless market 
introduction of new products and product enhancements will require coordination of our efforts with those of our suppliers to rapidly achieve volume production 
if we fail to coordinate these efforts  develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled  our revenues may be reduced and our business may be harmed 
we cannot assure you that product introductions will meet the anticipated release schedules 
our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trends 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our connectivity products 
these seasonal trends materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
our revenues are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the back to school and holiday as well as purchasers of pcs making purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements 
we are currently expanding our sales in international markets  particularly in asia  europe 
to the extent that our revenues in asia  europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods  we expect our period to period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products 
sales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy  often lasting nine months or longer 
in addition  it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons our original equipment manufacturer customers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products  over which we have no control  before placing a purchase order  the commercial integration of our products by an original equipment manufacturer is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance  and the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders 
the lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases 
if customer cancellations or product changes were to occur  this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses 
we rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers 
unauthorized use of our technology may result in development of products that compete with our products  which could cause our market share and our revenues to be reduced 
our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we have over patents granted or pending addressing both essential itu and non essential technologies 
these patents may never be issued 
these patents  both issued and pending  may not provide sufficiently broad protection against third party infringement lawsuits or they may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we may provide our licensees with access to our proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
finally  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  and some foreign laws  including those of various countries in asia  do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
we are subject to litigation regarding intellectual property  which has diverted management attention  is costly to defend and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents  product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
we have recently settled two significant patent infringement lawsuits  as described in more detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in this form k 
we entered into a settlement agreement with ess on february  the settlement requires ess to make an initial license payment of million and future royalty payments to us based on the terms under the settlement agreement 
on march   townshend entered into a settlement agreement with us  which settled the federal court action and state court action 
under the settlement agreement  terms of the settlement are confidential 
the settlement agreement requires us to make a cash royalty payment of million related to past liability and prepayment of future liabilities to townshend based on terms under the settlement agreement 
see discussion under contingencies in note for the impact of settlement on our financial position and results of operations 
we have also received communications from agere systems and com  and may receive communications from other third parties in the future  asserting that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  that our patents are unenforceable or that we have inappropriately licensed our intellectual property to third parties 
these claims could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent potential future customers from purchasing our products or licensing our technology 
because we depend upon a limited number of products  any claims of this kind  whether they are with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in the event that we do not prevail in litigation  we could be prevented from selling our products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms which may not be acceptable to us 
we could also be prevented from selling our products or be required to pay substantial monetary damages 
should we cross license our intellectual property in order to obtain licenses  we may no longer be able to offer a unique product 
to date  we have not obtained any licenses from agere systems and com 
new patent applications may be currently pending or filed in the future by third parties covering technology that we use currently or may use in the future 
pending us patent applications are confidential until patents are issued  and thus it is impossible to ascertain all possible patent infringement claims against us 
we believe that several of our competitors  including agere systems and texas instruments  may have a strategy of protecting their market share by filing intellectual property claims against their competitors and may assert claims against us in the future 
the legal and other expenses and diversion of resources associated with any such litigation could result in a decrease in our revenues and cash 
in addition  some of our customer agreements include an indemnity clause that obligates us to defend and pay all damages and costs finally awarded by a court should third parties assert patent and or copyright claims against our customers 
as a result  we may be held responsible for infringement claims asserted against our customers 
we have accrued for negotiated license fees and estimated royalty settlements related to existing and probable claims of patent infringement 
if the actual settlements exceed the amounts accrued  additional losses could be significant  which would adversely affect future operating results 
we recorded an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in our product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements and or ongoing royalties based upon our judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend our legal positions  and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
we have accrued our best estimate of the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements already signed  agreements that are in negotiation and unasserted but probable claims of others using advice from third party technology advisors and historical settlements 
should the final license agreements result in royalty rates significantly higher than our current estimates  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
competition in the connectivity market is intense  and if we are unable to compete effectively  the demand for our products may be reduced 
the connectivity device market is intensely competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
our current competitors include agere systems  boardcom  conexant  ess technology and smart link 
we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings  new suppliers enter the connectivity device market  new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployed 
we may in the future also face competition from other suppliers of products based on broadband and or wireless technologies or on emerging communication technologies  which may render our existing or future products obsolete or otherwise unmarketable 
we believe that these competitors may include com  alcatel  analog devices  globespanvirata  intersil and proxim 
we believe that the principal competitive factors required by users and customers in the connectivity product market include compatibility with industry standards  price  functionality  ease of use and customer service and support 
although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors 
in order for us to operate at a profitable level and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets  we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical  sales  support and other administrative personnel 
our past performance has been and our future performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering  sales  marketing  financial  technical and customer support personnel 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  a replacement could be difficult to recruit and we may not be able to grow our business 
competition for personnel  especially qualified engineering personnel  is intense 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
as of december   we employed a total of people in our engineering department 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key engineering personnel  our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets will be impaired 
we may have to continue to reduce our headcount  which may hinder our ability to develop and grow our business  which may ultimately affect our ability to become profitable 
in  we reduced our workforce by employees 
if economic conditions and the pc market do not improve  or if we decide to pursue new business structures or focus on different sectors  we may need to reduce our workforce even further 
this may result in  as it has in the past  additional charges and costs relating to severance and employment costs  as well as the closure of excess facilities 
if such an action is taken  it may temporarily inhibit our ability to develop new products or become profitable 
failure to manage our technological and product growth could strain our management  financial and administrative resources 
our ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process 
future product expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and by increasing the demands on their management abilities during periods of constrained spending 
we are focusing on the wireless areas as well as placing substantial effort on sustaining our leadership position in the analog modem space 
to effectively manage our growth in these new technologies  we must enhance our marketing  sales  research and development areas 
with revenues either stabilizing or declining  these efforts will have to be accomplished with limited funding 
this will require management to effectively manage significant technological advancement within reduced budgets 
we rely on independent companies to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
if these companies do not meet their commitments to us  our ability to sell products to our customers would be impaired 
we do not have our own manufacturing  assembly or testing operations 
instead  we rely on independent companies to manufacture  assemble and test the semiconductor chips that are integral components of our products 
most of these companies are located outside of the united states 
there are many risks associated with our relationships with these independent companies  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing costs  capacity during periods of excess demand  and access to process technologies 
in addition  the location of these independent parties outside of the united states creates additional risks resulting from the foreign regulatory  political and economic environments in which each of these companies exists 
further  some of these companies are located near earthquake fault lines 
while we have not experienced any material problems to date  failures or delays by our manufacturers to provide the semiconductor chips that we require for our products  or any material change in the financial arrangements we have with these companies  could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customer product requirements 
we design  market and sell application specific integrated circuits and outsource the manufacturing and assembly of the integrated circuits to third party fabricators 
the majority of our products and related components are manufactured by four principal companies taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  kawasaki lsi  admtek and silicon labs 
we expect to continue to rely upon these third parties for these services 
currently  the data access arrangement chips used in our soft modem products are provided by a sole source  silicon labs  on a purchase order basis  and we have only a limited guaranteed supply of data access arrangement chips through a long term business arrangement with silicon labs 
we have no guaranteed supply or long term contract agreements with any other of our suppliers 
although we believe that we would be able to qualify an alternative manufacturing source for data access arrangement chips within a relatively short period of time  this transition  if necessary  could result in loss of purchase orders or customer relationships  which could result in decreased revenues 
as of december   we have outstanding firm inventory purchase order commitments of million with our major suppliers  of which million was accrued as inventory losses 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance of our products 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
to date  we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products 
however  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance 
connectivity devices generally require individual government approvals throughout the world to operate on local telephone networks 
these certifications collectively referred to as homologation can delay or impede the acceptance of our products on a worldwide basis 
connectivity products require extensive testing prior to receiving certification by each government to be authorized to connect to their telephone systems 
this testing can delay the introduction or  in extreme cases  prohibit the product usage in a particular country 
international telecommunications union standards seek to provide a worldwide standard to avoid these issues  but they do not eliminate the need for testing in each country 
in addition to these government certifications  individual internet service providers  or isps  can also have unique line conditions that must be addressed 
since most large pc manufacturers want to be able to release their products on a worldwide basis  this entire process can significantly slow the introduction of new products 
our financial position and results of operations can be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes 
we currently operate with subsidiaries in the cayman islands and japan as well as branch offices in taiwan  korea and france 
the complexities brought on by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably leads to an increased exposure to worldwide tax challenges 
should the tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes  our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our industry if the market for products using our hsp technology does not grow as we plan  or if our products are not accepted in these markets  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our success depends on market demand and growth patterns for products using our hsp technology in soft analog modems 
market success for our products depends primarily on cost and performance benefits relative to competing solutions 
although we have shipped a significant number of soft modems since we began commercial sales of these products  the current level of demand for soft modems may not be sustained or may not grow 
further  the company s success in the soft modem market is dependent on developing  selling and supporting next generation products and applications 
if these new products are not accepted in the markets as they are introduced  our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected 
in  we introduced our solsis tm modem for the embedded internet access market 
we anticipate sales of this product to grow and become an important component in our product mix 
however  if the non pc internet appliance market does not accept our product or if demand for embedded analog modems is weaker than projected  our revenues can be adversely affected 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the internet access business is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  we have successfully introduced several new products with advanced technologies since our company was founded 
for example  we introduced a kbps product in  a kbps product in  a kbps product in late  a non international telecommunications union standard kbps modem in the second half of and a v 
international telecommunications union standard kbps modem in early starting in and continuing into  we expect to see the introduction of additional international telecommunications union standards  referred to as v 
and v 
we continue to develop and sell advanced analog modem products in order to remain competitive in our core business 
the market for high speed internet connectivity is also characterized by rapidly changing technologies and strong competition  such as broadband and wireless solutions  which provide higher modem speeds and faster internet access 
while these alternative technologies offer much faster data rates  they are comparatively more costly than analog modems 
they are also not as widely available in the world markets 
we will continue to evaluate  develop and introduce technologically advanced products that will position the company for possible growth in the internet access market 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
changes in laws or regulations  in particular  future fcc regulations affecting the broadband market  internet service providers  or the communications industry  could negatively affect our ability to develop new technologies or sell new products and therefore  reduce our profitability 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission  or fcc  extends to the entire communications industry  including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products 
future fcc regulations affecting the broadband access services industry  our customers or our products may harm our business 
for example  future fcc regulatory policies that affect the availability of data and internet services may impede our customers penetration into their markets or affect the prices that they are able to charge 
in addition  international regulatory bodies are beginning to adopt standards for the communications industry 
although our business has not been hurt by any regulations to date  in the future  delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements may result in order cancellations or postponements of product purchases by our customers  which would reduce our profitability 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities  computer systems and personnel  which are primarily located in or near our principal headquarters in milpitas  california 
california has experienced power outages due to a shortage in the supply of power within the state 
in anticipation of continuing power shortages  the electric utility industry in california has warned power consumers to expect rolling blackouts throughout the state  particularly during the summer months when power usage peaks 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
although the blackouts we have experienced to date have not materially impacted our business  an increase in the frequency or length of the blackouts could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry has caused power prices to increase 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase  as the majority of our facilities are located in california 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be volatile based on a number of factors  some of which are not in our control 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  many of which are out of our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in our industry  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  mergers and acquisitions  and sales of common stock by us or our stockholders 
in addition  the nasdaq national market  where many publicly held telecommunications companies  including our company  are traded  often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company 
this type of litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
provisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management which may cause the market price for our common stock to fall and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  and as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent  do not permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting and provide for a classified board of directors  which means stockholders can only elect  or remove  a limited number of our directors in any given year 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
further  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may drop 
the board of directors has not elected to issue additional shares of preferred stock since the initial public offering on october  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating all transactions in us dollars 
we may be exposed to interest rate risks  as we may use additional financing to fund additional acquisitions and fund other capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past
