the second swap which expires on june  fixes the interest rate for borrowing levels at million at plus applicable margin

working capital at june  was million  a decrease of million from at june  the working capital ratio at june  was compared with at june  net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared with million provided by operating activities during net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to a net reduction in accounts receivable of million  inventory reductions of million  non cash expenses of million  a reduction in deferred tax assets of million  partially offset by a net loss of million  and a million decrease in customer deposits and accrued expenses

the number of days of sales in accounts receivable improved at june  to days compared with days at june  the improvement of days accounted for a further reduction in net accounts receivable of approximately million and was primarily due to an increased effort on cash collections 
the number of days of sales in accounts receivable is calculated by dividing the average net accounts receivable balance by the revenues for the prior fiscal period multiplied by days for the fiscal period 
the reduction in inventory of million was primarily due to sales of used hosiery and yarn processing equipment coupled with increases in inventory reserves related to used hosiery equipment 
the decrease in current and long term deferred taxes of million was primarily due to new tax legislation in which enabled the company to carry back operating losses rather than using them to offset future operating income 
as a result  the company received a tax refund of million in and has classified  as a current income tax receivable 
the deferred tax asset was further reduced by a  valuation reserve against net operating loss carry forwards in the event that they expired prior to utilization 
these reductions were offset by increases in deferred tax benefits associated with the current year operating loss of million and inventory valuation reserves of  the company believes the net deferred tax benefits will be recoverable through its normal course of business in the future 
the net decrease in accounts payable and overdraft of million during fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with the decrease in the company s sales 
the percentage drop in cost of sales of million in fiscal year as compared to cost of sales of million in fiscal year was approximately 
this accounted for a million decrease in accounts payable and bank overdraft 
the net decrease in customer deposits of million during fiscal was primarily due to the restructuring of one customer s deposit for million into a trade note payable from fiscal the remaining decrease is attributable to lower sales in compared with net cash provided in investing activities for was  which was primarily from proceeds on the disposition of assets

the company s credit facility with southtrust matures december  as of september   speizman had million in borrowings under its line of credit facility with a commercial bank 
this facility matures december  the company currently does not have the financial resources to repay this debt when it becomes due and will therefore need to refinance this debt prior to maturity 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to refinance this debt with another lender on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
additionally  the textile industry has continued to experience tightened lending practices from traditional financial institutions which may further hinder speizman s ability to refinance this debt  especially in light of speizman s recent financial losses 
if speizman is unable to refinance this debt or obtain needed additional capital  it would be required to significantly reduce its operations  dispose of assets and or sell additional securities on terms that could be dilutive to current stockholders 
the company believes that it will refinance with another bank as it has in the past few years 
however  there is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or desired on terms favorable to the company or at all 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents our long term contractual obligations payment due by periods less than total one year years years after years long term debt    capital lease obligations      irrevocable letters of credit   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations      seasonality and other factors there are certain seasonal factors that may affect the company s business 
traditionally  manufacturing businesses in italy close for the month of august  and the company s domestic hosiery customers close for one week in july 
consequently  no shipments or deliveries  as the case may be  of machines distributed by the company that are manufactured in italy are made during these periods which fall in the company s first quarter 
in addition  manufacturing businesses in italy generally close for two weeks in december  during the company s second quarter 
fluctuations of customer orders or other factors may result in quarterly variations in net revenues from year to year 
effects of inflation and changing prices management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
disclosure about foreign currency losses in fiscal year historically  speizman industries purchases of foreign manufactured machinery and spare parts for resale have been denominated in italian lira 
as part of its risk management programs  the company historically has used forward exchange contracts to protect against the currency exchange risk associated with the company s anticipated and firm commitments of lira denominated purchases for resale 
in cases where anticipated or firm commitments are cancelled or postponed that were previously hedged with foreign currency contracts  the utilization of these forward exchange contracts on future purchases may positively or negatively affect the earnings of the company  depending upon the position of the us dollar against the lira at the time of the actual purchases 
the company cancelled or postponed orders during calendar year due to unanticipated delays associated with the closed toe machines as well as cancellations by customers who had signed sales orders with the company for closed toe hosiery and knitted fabric equipment 
associated with these cancelled purchase orders  the company had committed to purchase contracts of approximately billion lira during the latter part of calendar year the utilization of this lira during fiscal year for other purchases coupled with the continual strengthening position of the dollar since had a significant adverse effect on gross profit during fiscal year the adverse effect on gross profit through increased cost of sales during the year ended june was approximately million 
additionally  of the billion lira contracts associated with the cancelled purchase orders  approximately billion lira were uncommitted and were treated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
for cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income equity  then recognized in the statement of operations in the same period as the sale is recognized on the hedged item 
these commitments were initially designated to be utilized on anticipated purchase commitments primarily related to two product lines 
due to delays by the manufacturers  the company renegotiated its future purchases with these foreign suppliers in us dollars 
in light of this  on november   the company deemed these foreign currency derivatives as ineffective for hedge accounting as originally designated going forward 
accordingly  and in light of the potential future devaluation of the lira in relation to the us dollar  the company entered into offsetting foreign currency derivatives in order to fix its exposure on the ineffective cash flow derivatives and reported a loss on settlement of cash flow derivatives of approximately million  before income tax benefit 
the company had no foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of june  in summary  the total losses associated with the utilization of the company s fair value hedge contracts and the settlement of its cash flow hedges were approximately million for fiscal year  before tax benefit 
in the future  currency fluctuations of the lira could result in substantial price level changes and therefore impede or promote import export sales and substantially impact profits 
generally  the company is not able to assess the quantitative effect that such currency fluctuations could have upon the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a significant adverse effect on speizman industries future operations 
in addition  the company is continually evaluating other alternatives to limit its risk on foreign currency fluctuations and is currently purchasing a majority of its textile equipment denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill in assessing the value of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the carrying account of the assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
effective july   the company adopted statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and is now required to analyze goodwill for impairment issues on an annual basis 
during fiscal  the company reduced the carrying account of goodwill associated with its finishing division and took a charge to income for million 
inventory and bad debt reserves in assessing the value of the company s accounts receivable and inventory  management must make assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable and the market value of the company s inventory 
in the case of accounts receivable  the company considers the current and future financial condition of it s customers and judgmentally determines the reserve required 
in the case of inventory  the company considers recent sales of similar products  trends in the industry and other factors when establishing an inventory reserve 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded a deferred tax benefit associated with its net operating losses and other timing differences associated with tax regulations and generally accepted accounting principles  because management believes these assets will be recoverable by offsetting future taxable income 
if the company does not return to profitability  or if the loss carryforwards cannot be utilized within federal statutory deadlines currently years  the asset may be impaired 
during fiscal  the company reduced its deferred tax asset by  in light of these uncertainties 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the standard retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
management does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments  pursuant to company policies 
to minimize interest rate exposures  the company may use interest rate swap derivatives 
these derivatives fix the interest rate for borrowings specified in the swap agreements 
the company used interest rate swap derivatives during fiscal and the value of the us dollar affects the company s financial results 
changes in exchange rates primarily the euro may positively or negatively affect the company s revenues as expressed in us dollars  cost of sales  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings 
where the company deems it prudent  it engages in hedging those transactions aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
as discussed in the foreign currency risk section set forth herein under risk factors  the company purchases forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the company s anticipated and firm commitments of lira dominated purchases for resale 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks and interest rate fluctuation 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s programs include volatility of the currency markets  interest rate fluctuation and availability of hedging instruments 
all hedging contracts that are entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated exposure  not for speculation 
although the company maintains programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against the euro in which the company has anticipated purchase commitments  the company s gross margins could be adversely affected if future sale prices cannot be increased because of market pressures
