overview general 
hines is one of the largest commercial nursery operations in north america  producing one of the broadest assortments of container grown plants in the industry 
the company sells its nursery products primarily to the retail segment  which includes premium independent garden centers  as well as leading home centers and mass merchandisers  such as home depot  lowe s  wal mart and target 
the company believes that sales of its nursery products have been positively affected by societal and demographic trends  such as greater levels of homeownership  the aging of the american population and the increasing popularity of gardening 
recent trends in the retail distribution channel  such as the expansion of large big box retailers and their growing emphasis on the lawn and garden category  have increased consumer exposure to lawn and garden products 
management believes these trends have favorably impacted the company and provide excellent opportunities for improved operating performance 
seasonality 
the company s nursery business  like that of its competitors  is highly seasonal 
the company has  and expects to continue to experience significant variability in net sales  operating income and net income on a quarterly basis 
recent developments acquisitions 
the company completed a number of acquisitions to expand and diversify its operations 
in the three years ended december   the company s green goods business completed one acquisition in and two acquisitions in  all of which have been accounted for under the purchase method 
accordingly  the purchase prices were allocated to certain assets and liabilities based on their respective fair market values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired relating to each transaction was accounted for as goodwill 
amounts allocated to goodwill are being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated life of thirty five years 
the funds used for the acquisitions were provided by the company s existing acquisition facility 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each acquisition from the date of acquisition 
these acquisitions have and will continue to affect the period to period comparability of the operating results discussed below 
tax matters 
the company derives significant benefits under the us federal tax code by qualifying to use the cash method of accounting for federal income tax purposes 
under the cash method  sales are included in taxable income when payments are received and expenses are deducted as they are paid 
the primary benefit the company receives is the ability to deduct the cost of inventory as it is incurred 
as a result of the company s ability to deduct its growing costs under the farming exception  the company has generally not been required to pay cash income taxes and has generated net operating losses for federal income tax purposes 
in  the company has generated a taxable loss for federal income tax purposes 
during the same period  the company has continued to show a tax provision relating to the recording of deferred taxes 
at december   the company had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following areas represent its most critical accounting policies related to actual results that may vary from those estimates 
sales returns and allowances amounts accrued for sales returns and allowance are maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the trade receivable due to sales discounts and allowances 
the provision rate is established by management using the following criteria past sales returns experience  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors  and is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is increased by provisions for sales discounts and allowances charged against income 
the company records revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when the risk of ownership is transferred to the customer 
allowances are provided at the time of revenue is recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for bad debts is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to reflect the probable losses in the trade receivable due to customer default  insolvency  or bankruptcy 
the provision is established by management using the following criteria customer credit history  customer current credit rating  and other relevant factors  and is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is increased by provisions to bad debt expense charged against income 
all recoveries on trade receivables previously charged off are credited to the accounts receivable recovery account charged against income  while direct charge offs of trade receivables are deducted from the allowance 
accounting for goodwill impairment goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions is being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated life of years 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the recoverability of goodwill by comparing projected operating income on an undiscounted basis to the net book value of the related assets

liquidity and capital resources the company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements through operating cash flow and seasonal borrowings under its revolving credit facilities 
due to the highly seasonal nature of its nursery operations  the company historically borrows under its revolving credit facilities to fund peak needs

in  the company entered into a senior credit facility the senior credit facility which provided for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility  comprised of a million working capital facility and a million acquisition facility 
the senior credit facility  which originally had a five year term  was extended effective february   to december  the revolving credit facility and all other obligations under the senior credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets and common stock of hines nurseries and sun gro us effective february   the term loan and acquisition facility were combined into one term loan facility  the new term loan

as of december   million in aggregate principal amount remains outstanding 
the indenture pursuant to which the senior subordinated notes were issued imposes a number of restrictions on hines nurseries and sun gro us the indenture limits  among other things  their ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make certain restricted payments including dividends to hines  to make certain asset dispositions  to incur certain liens and to enter into certain significant transactions 
in addition  breach of a material term of the indenture or any other material indebtedness that results in the acceleration of such indebtedness would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility  causing all amounts owing thereunder to become immediately due and payable

as a result of the requirement to record a deferred income tax expense of million related to the difference between the book and tax basis of the investment in sun gro canada by sun gro us for the anticipated repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the sale of sun gro canada which was completed on march   the company was unable to comply with the net worth covenant under its amended senior credit facility 
the company requested and received a waiver from its senior lenders effective march net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million increased million from million for the comparable period in the higher cash level generated was primarily due to the lower level of accounts receivable and the higher levels of accounts payables and accruals compared to the prior period in the seasonal nature of the company s operations results in a significant increase in certain components of working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventory during the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities during the first and fourth quarters of used significant amounts of cash  totaling million and million  respectively 
in contrast  the operating activities for the second and third quarters generated substantial cash  totaling million and million  respectively  as the company shipped inventory and collected accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to the company s prior year s acquisitions of willow creek and lovell and lower capital expenditures during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the comparable period in the decrease was directly related to the prior year s advances under the acquisition facility to finance the acquisitions completed during the year and to lower borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
the company typically draws under its revolving credit facilities in the first and fourth quarters to fund its seasonal inventory buildup of green goods products and seasonal operating expenses 
approximately of the sales of hines nurseries occur in the first half of the year  generally allowing the company to reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facilities in the second and third quarters 
working capital requirements for the company s growing media operations are less seasonal in nature  with slight inventory buildups generally occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
on march   the company had fully utilized its million of borrowing capacity under its working capital revolver facility and had unused borrowing capacity of million under the additional seasonal million revolving loan commitment within the amended senior credit facility 
as a result of the company s ability to deduct its growing costs under the farming exception  the company has generally not been required to pay cash income taxes in recent years and has generated net operating losses for federal income tax purposes 
even with the benefits of the farming exception  the company may nonetheless be required to pay cash income taxes in future years after use  loss or expiration of its tax net operating loss carryforwards 
such cash income taxes could also result from increased taxable income due to  among other reasons i any slowdown in  or elimination of  future growth in the company s inventory of growing plants or ii limits on the company s ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset all of its tax liability under the alternative minimum tax system 
the company s capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended december  the capital expenditures for hines nurseries related primarily to the purchase of land at our fallbrook site  which the company had been obligated to acquire as part of that acquisition completed in  the completion of acreage expansion plans  which the company began in late at its south carolina and miami facilities  the continued implementation of the erp information system  which will standardize systems and processes throughout the company  and the purchase of nursery related structures  vehicles  machinery and equipment 
the company s capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately to million

this agreement had previously been designated as a cash flow hedging relationship but did not qualify as a hedge under sfas no
