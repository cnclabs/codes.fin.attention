item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and marketing of novel therapeutic and predictive medicine products 
we have developed a number of proprietary proteomic technologies which permit us to identify genes  their related proteins and the biological pathways they form 
we use this information to better understand the role proteins play in the onset and progression of human disease 
we operate two wholly owned subsidiaries  myriad pharmaceuticals  inc and myriad genetic laboratories  inc  to commercialize our therapeutic and predictive medicine discoveries 
myriad pharmaceuticals  inc develops and intends to market novel therapeutic products 
myriad genetic laboratories  inc focuses on the development and marketing of predictive medicine products that assess an individual s risk of developing a specific disease 
myriad researchers have made important discoveries in the fields of cancer  viral diseases such as aids  and acute thrombosis 
these discoveries point to novel disease pathways and have paved the way for the development of new drugs 
additionally  our pipeline of drug targets offers therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of diseases such as heart disease  rheumatoid arthritis  alzheimer s disease and other central nervous system disorders 
we have identified drug targets to date 
we have also established an extensive portfolio of drug candidates that are under development at myriad 
fifteen of these drug candidates are in pre clinical testing 
flurizan  our lead therapeutic product for the treatment of prostate cancer  is currently in a large  multi center human clinical trial 
we also recently submitted an investigational new drug ind application for the evaluation of r flurbiprofen mpc for the treatment of alzheimer s disease 
we intend to independently develop and  subject to regulatory approval  market our therapeutic products  particularly in the area of cancer and infectious diseases 
we also have developed and commercialized five innovative predictive medicine products bracanalysis  which is used to assess a woman s risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer  colaris and colaris ap  which are used to determine a person s risk of developing colon cancer  melaris  which is used to determine a person s risk of developing malignant melanoma  and cardiarisk  which is used for therapeutic management of hypertensive patients 
we market these products using our own internal person sales force in the united states and we have entered into marketing collaborations with other organizations in austria  brazil  canada  germany  japan  and switzerland 
revenues from these proprietary products grew approximately from the prior year to million in the fiscal year ended june  we believe that the future of medicine lies in the creation of new classes of drugs that prevent disease from occurring or progressing and that treat the cause  not just the symptoms  of disease 
in addition  we believe that advances in the emerging field of predictive medicine will improve our ability to determine which patients are subject to a greater risk of developing these diseases and who therefore should receive these new preventive medicines 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to maintaining our research and development programs  undertaking drug discovery and development  and operating our predictive medicine business 
our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of predictive medicine products and research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements  upfront fees  and milestone payments 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for the year ended june   we had a net loss of million and as of june  had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have formed strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical or multinational companies including abbott laboratories  bayer corporation  ei du pont de nemours and company dupont  eli lilly and company  hitachi ltd  hoffmann laroche inc  novartis corporation  oracle corporation  pharmacia corporation  schering ag  schering plough corporation  and torrey mesa research institute  a subsidiary of syngenta 
we intend to enter into additional collaborative relationships to discover genes  proteins  protein networks  and drug targets associated with common diseases as well as to continue to fund internal research projects 
however  we may be unable to enter into additional collaborative relationships on terms acceptable to us 
in april  we announced the formation of myriad proteomics  inc  a new venture with hitachi  ltd 
and oracle corporation to map the human proteome 
myriad proteomics  which is percent owned by the company  intends to develop and market a proprietary map of the human proteome to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for therapeutic and diagnostic product development 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  expansion of our research and development programs  launch of new predictive medicine products  and expansion of our facilities 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our pharmaceutical and predictive medicine businesses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  investments in privately held companies  investment in myriad proteomics  inc  revenue recognition 
we apply the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab to all our revenue transactions 
research revenues include revenues from research and technology licensing agreements 
we recognize revenue from research contracts in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting and following the guidance in statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percent complete is estimated based on costs incurred relative to total estimated contract costs 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in the percentage of completion method of accounting as work progresses and we gain experience 
our estimates of total contract costs include assumptions  such as estimated research hours to complete  materials costs  and other direct and indirect costs 
actual results may vary significantly from our estimates 
revenues related to up front payments and technology license fees when continuing involvement or research services are required of us are recognized over the period of performance 
predictive medicine revenues include revenues from the sale of predictive medicine products and related marketing agreements 
predictive medicine revenue is recognized upon completion of the test and communication of results 
up front payments related to marketing agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
investments in privately held companies 
we review the valuation of our investments in privately held biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for possible impairment as changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment should be assessed 
the amount of impairment  if any  and valuation of these investments are based on our estimates and  in certain circumstances  the completion of independent  third party appraisals of the investments 
inherent in these estimates and appraisals are assumptions such as the comparability of the investee to similar publicly traded companies  the value of the investee s underlying research and development efforts  the likelihood that the investee s current research projects will result in a marketable product  and the investee s expected future cash flows 
accordingly  the amount recognized by us upon ultimate liquidation of these investments may vary significantly from the estimated fair values at june  investment in myriad proteomics 
in april  we announced the formation of a new alliance with hitachi  ltd 
hitachi  friedli corporate finance ag friedli  and oracle corporation oracle to map the human proteome 
the newly formed entity  myriad proteomics  inc myriad proteomics intends to develop and market its proprietary proteomic information to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for therapeutic and diagnostic product development 
as part of the formation of myriad proteomics we entered into administrative and scientific outsourcing agreements with myriad proteomics 
these agreements expired on june  and new agreements covering subsequent limited outsourcing services have been established 
charges to myriad proteomics for services incurred related to the administrative and scientific outsourcing agreements were based on actual time and expenses that we incurred on behalf of myriad proteomics and were not recorded as revenues but as a contra research expense 
results of operations years ended june  and research revenues for our fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  research revenue is comprised of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements  amortization of license fees and milestone payments 
this decrease of in research revenue is primarily attributable to greater emphasis on our internal research and drug development programs  performing research for myriad proteomics  and the successful completion of the bayer and tmri collaborations in december partially offsetting the overall decrease in research revenue were revenues from our new collaborations with abbott laboratories and dupont  both entered into in march research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is generally recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues increase or decrease proportionately 
predictive medicine revenues for our fiscal year ended june  were million  an increase of or million over the prior fiscal year 
predictive medicine revenue is comprised of sales of predictive medicine products and fees and royalties from our predictive medicine product marketing partners 
increased sales and marketing efforts and wider acceptance of our products by the medical community have resulted in increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  however  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenues will continue to increase at historical rates 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trial for flurizan and increased research spending for our ongoing drug discovery efforts in myriad pharmaceuticals 
research and development expenses were partially offset by reimbursement for research we performed for myriad proteomics as part of a scientific outsourcing agreement 
for the fiscal year ended june   research and development expenses were reduced by million as a result of these scientific outsourcing services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  executive  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology  and business development personnel  allocated facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
the increase of was primarily attributable to increases in our sales force from to sales representatives  the launch of two new predictive medicine products  and marketing costs related to our direct to consumer campaign to support our predictive medicine business 
we expect this larger sales force and related marketing efforts to enable us to increase awareness of our predictive medicine business 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate dependent on the number and scope of new product launches and our drug discovery and development efforts 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities decreased million or from million at june  to million at june  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities is primarily attributable to increased expenditures for our internal drug development programs and other expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of the our decreased cash position and declining interest rates  interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
years ended june  and research revenues for our fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in our research revenue of was primarily attributable to increased revenue recognized from both our hitachi and tmri collaborations 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is generally recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues increase or decrease proportionately 
predictive medicine revenues of million were recognized in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of or million over the prior year 
predictive medicine revenue is comprised of sales of predictive medicine products resulting from our discovery of important disease genes 
the successful launch of colaris  as well as increased sales and marketing efforts  together with wider acceptance of our products by the medical community  gave rise to the increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  however  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenues will continue to increase at historical rates 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the prior year  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the drug discovery and drug development efforts of myriad pharmaceuticals  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  as well as research activities relating to our strategic collaborations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ongoing promotion of our predictive medicine business  including the launch of colaris  that was introduced in september we also bolstered our sales force to full time employees  to allow us to increase awareness of our predictive medicine business through direct contact with health care professionals 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate as needed in support of our predictive medicine business and our drug discovery and development efforts 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities increased million  or  from million at june  to million at june  this increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities was primarily attributable to the sale of approximately million of our common stock in private placements during the year  as well as receipt of approximately million from license fees and milestone payments 
as a result of our increased cash position  interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of 
the loss on disposition of assets of million in the fiscal year ended june  was primarily the result of our retiring unproductive assets 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
trade receivables increased million between june  and june   primarily due to the increase in predictive medicine sales during the same period 
prepaid expenses increased million between june  and june  due to advance payments to purchase lab supplies at a discount 
related party receivables decreased million between june  and june   due to reimbursement for services provided to myriad proteomics 
other assets increased million between june  and june   primarily due to the acquisition of patents 
related party payables increased million between june  and june  due to equipment purchased from myriad proteomics 
deferred revenue  representing the difference in collaborative payments received and research revenue recognized  decreased by million between june  and june  our investing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and used cash of million during the prior fiscal year 
investing activities were comprised primarily of changes to marketable investment securities and capital expenditures for research equipment 
during the fiscal year ended june   we shifted a portion of our investments from marketable investment securities to cash and cash equivalents due to changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended june  other assets increased million due to an investment in a privately held pharmaceutical company  and was partially offset million due to the sale of part of our investment in a separate privately held biotechnology company 
additional investing activities included capital expenditures of million for research equipment and facility improvements 
financing activities provided million during the fiscal year ended june   due to the exercise of stock options 
on november   we filed a form s shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the sale of up to million of various types of securities  which the sec declared effective on november  the registered shares are available for sale at our discretion upon the filing of a prospectus supplement with the sec 
we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of our drug discovery and drug development programs  the cost of developing and launching additional predictive medicine products  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the costs associated with competing technological and market developments  the payments received under collaborative agreements and changes in collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of our discoveries  if any  including the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  and the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures and administrative and legal expenses 
because of our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified either as available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held to maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
