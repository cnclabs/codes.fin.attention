item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income after provision for possible loan losses  its revenue from other banking services and non interest expenses 
net interest income depends upon the net interest rate spread between the yield on the loan and investment portfolios and the cost of funds  consisting primarily of interest expense on deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
the interest rate spread is affected by the match between the maturities or repricing intervals of interest bearing assets and liabilities  the mix and composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  economic factors influencing general interest rates  prepayment on loans and mortgage backed investments  loan demand and savings flows  as well as the effect of competition for deposits and loans 
net interest income is also affected by the performance of the loan portfolio  amortization on accretion of premiums or discounts on purchased loans or mortgage backed securities and the level of non earning assets 
revenues from loan fees and other banking services depend upon the volume of new transactions and the market level of prices for competitive products and services 
non interest expenses depend upon the efficiency of the company s internal operations and general market and economic conditions 
in august  the company opened  in cohasset  the first of five planned de novo supermarket branches  with the randolph april and hanson september branches opening in  brockton may opening in and canton opening in november additionally  the company opened a new traditional branch in hanover in july this expansion of the company s retail branch network is consistent with the company s strategy of controlled growth with a focus on core retail deposit relationships and will enable the company to have a greater regional presence 
on april   the company acquired old colony mortgage corporation ocm see note to the consolidated financial statements 
ocm is headquartered in brockton  and has origination offices in plymouth  fall river and auburn massachusetts as well as a presence in each of the company s branches 
this acquisition was made to expand the company s mortgage origination capabilities from what they were previously as well as to provide the company with a greater diversity of sources of income

net interest income net interest income is affected by the mix and volume of assets and liabilities  and levels of prepayment primarily on loans and mortgage backed investments  the movement and level of interest rates  and interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield received on earning assets and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings

the yield on mortgage backed investments was in as compared to for the yield on investment securities was in as compared to in the yield on investment securities in was positively influenced by two agency issued bonds which had been purchased at a discount and were called at the issuer s option during the year 
this resulted in  of discounts being taken into income which increased the yield on investment securities by basis points 
the resulting investment securities yield for excluding these discounts was  which was slightly below the yield on these same investments 
the yields on both mortgage backed investments and investment securities have been primarily influenced by the rate environment which existed in from june through july  the federal reserve bank raised the inter bank borrowing rate by basis points 
from january through december  the federal reserve bank lowered the inter bank borrowing rate basis points which in turn  but to a lesser degree has influenced yields on assets purchased since the second quarter of  particularly in relation to the yields available for comparable securities a year ago 
the average balances of loans decreased slightly to  in as compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
the balances declined primarily as a result of residential mortgage loans paying off more quickly in due to historically lower interest rates available on new mortgages which prompted customers to refinance those loans see later discussion regarding mortgage origination volumes and gains on sales of mortgages 
additionally  given the historically low rates available on loans originated or for purchase  management elected to purchase mortgage backed investment securities rather than loans due to generally shorter available average lives in light of the current interest rate environment in comparison to those historically typically available 
interest expense interest expense for decreased  or to  in from  in  generally due to decreases in the rates paid on non time deposits and borrowed funds and declines in the average balances of borrowed funds  offset in part by increases in the rates paid on time deposits and overall increases in average deposit balances

these increases in core and time deposits in as compared to relate to the attractiveness of the company s retail products and services in the marketplace it serves as well as reflecting some of the benefits of the fallout from the in market bank merger activity in mid management will continue to closely manage its cost of deposits by continuing to seek methods of acquiring new core deposits and maintaining its current core deposits while prudently adding time deposits at reasonable rates 
the average balances of borrowed funds decreased overall to  in as compared to  in  a decline of  or

the rates paid on time deposits increased in generally due to intense competition on the pricing of time deposits which has existed since the third quarter of it is anticipated given the current interest rate environment  that the rates paid on time deposits and borrowed funds could decline from current levels in future periods as they reach maturity 
see asset liability management for further discussion of the competitive market for deposits and overall strategies for the uses of borrowed funds 
non interest income total non interest income increased  or in as compared to customer service fees  which were  in as compared to  in for an increase of  or 
these fees rose primarily due to growth in deposit accounts  primarily now and checking account portfolios and continued success in cross selling customers other products and services  debit card activity and sales of mutual funds and annuities the company received regulatory approval to sell insurance annuities in may 
the sales of mutual funds and insurance annuities accounted for  of the aforementioned increase in customer service fees 
loan servicing fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans were  and  respectively in as compared to  and  respectively  in the increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans of  or was generally due to a favorable market for residential loan originations which existed for most of as compared to this favorable market was due to lower available mortgage rates in it is expected that the volume of mortgage originations will likely decline in in comparison to these historically high levels in loan servicing fees have continued to decline as the company has been selling loans on a servicing released basis since and as a result  in combination with loan payoffs this portfolio has continued to decline 
losses on securities  net  were  in as compared to gains of  in  for a decrease of  the results for include a writedown and subsequent loss on sale of a corporate bond of  in management made the decision to sell this bond in the fourth quarter of  which was the only investment holding which had been downgraded to below investment grade  after considering the issuer s crown  cork seal financial difficulties exacerbated by continuing asbestos litigation claims 
there were also approximately  in realized losses on sales of equity securities during the year  particularly in the technology and telecommunication sectors  as part of management s strategy to re position the equity portfolio holdings given current market conditions and as part of overall tax planning 
these losses were offset by gains on sales of equities during the year of  and an additional  of gains on sales of mortgage backed and investment securities during the year 
these gains on sales of mortgage backed securities and agency securities were generally taken on those holdings  some of which were previously purchased at a discount  which were likely to be called or had a high risk of being prepaid 
non interest expense non interest expenses for increased  or compared to salaries and employee benefits increased  or in as compared to primarily due to the opening of the canton november and hanover july branches  increases in salaries and commissions on brokerage and annuity sales associated with higher revenues and sales volumes  increases in salaries and commissions associated with the increases in mortgage origination and sales volumes and related gains on sales approximately  and other general increases in salaries and customer service staffing levels 
these increases correspond with the company s strategic focus of attracting new core deposits and new customer service relationships 
occupancy expenses were  or higher in as compared to this increase included approximately  of writedowns related to management s re valuation of some non branch premises and real estate holdings in the fourth quarter of additionally  the cost for occupancy and equipment were also influenced by the openings of the canton november and hanover july offices the impact of which increased costs by approximately  the company also realized increases in the cost of utilities and snow removal during as compared to of approximately  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and equipment expenses related to the expiration of maintenance contracts associated with the company s prior mainframe system of approximately  other non interest expenses  including trust preferred securities expense  also increased  or 
this increase was attributable to increases associated with the company s payments to a third party service bureau the company converted from an in house mainframe system in june  which have also been influenced by higher customer volumes in as compared to approximately  increases in marketing expenses  increases in costs for item processing and statement rendering which were related to higher volumes of items processed and accounts serviced approximately  higher foreclosure and workout related expenses primarily associated with legal and professional cost for one large credit approximately  see provision for loan losses and credit quality for additional discussion and other general volume related and inflationary increases 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses was  for which had increased from  in  for an increase of  or 
this increase in provision primarily related to two credits  both of which were on non accrual at december  the most significant of these credits was a  relationship which was primarily a commercial credit involved in the telecommunications industry 
the delinquency rate and non performing assets at december  were and  respectively as compared to 
and  respectively  at december  without the aforementioned telecommunications credit  the delinquency and non performing asset levels would have been 
and  respectively  which is more consistent with the december  levels 
the allowance for loan losses is arrived at by management after careful consideration of various asset quality factors including delinquency rates and trends  non performing and watched asset levels and overall historical charge off rates by major loan type 
the resulting allowance for loan losses were and at december  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for was as compared to in the lower effective tax rate in comparison to statutory rates for both periods is reflective of income earned by certain non bank subsidiaries which are taxed  for state tax purposes  at lower rates 
cumulative effect of change in accounting in december  the company elected to early adopt eitf accounting for certain sales incentives 
this pronouncement provided additional guidance for the accounting for the cost of incentives given to customers to open new deposit accounts with the bank 
under this guidance the cost of the incentive should be charged to earnings on the date the account is opened 
this varies from the previous methodology used by the company which was to defer this cost and amortize it to expense over the expected life of the deposit account relationship 
the impact of this change in accounting is reflected on a net of tax basis as if it were applied at the beginning of the current year 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was to write off the unamortized portion of previously capitalized incentives at january  totaling  net of tax 
additionally previously reported quarterly operating results have been restated to reflect the application of the new accounting principle in this quarterly restatement did not have a material impact on the quarterly results note comparison of the years ended december  and general net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share compared to net income of  or per diluted share in  a net increase of  or on a net income basis or an increase of 
or on a per diluted share basis 
the overall increase in net income was mainly attributable to increases in net interest income and customer service fees and decreases in the provision for possible loan losses  offset in part by increases in non interest expense 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income increased  or during  as compared to the increase was attributable to increases in earning assets and  to a lesser degree  increases in the yield earned on those assets 
the balance of average earning assets for was approximately  as compared to  in  an overall increase of  or 
the increase in earning assets was  in part  due to increases in average loan balances which were  for  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase in balances was generally caused by larger volumes of commercial loan originations in and into as well as higher residential loan balances which were the result of loan originations purchases throughout and into see liquidity and capital resources and asset liability management for further discussion of the company s loan purchasing and investment strategies 
the average yield earned on loans increased slightly to for from for loan yields in were affected by increases in the yields on loans originated purchased in the second half of and into yields on loans were also positively affected by growth in the company s commercial loan portfolio including commercial real estate and construction which grew to approximately  at december  from  at december   an increase of  or 
commercial loans typically carry a higher yield than residential mortgages 
average balances of mortgage backed investments and bond investment securities were  and  respectively  for as compared to  and  respectively  for the corresponding period in these balances  when combined  increased  or 
the yields on mortgage backed investments and bond investment securities rose to and  respectively  in  from and  respectively  in this was generally due to the acquisition of higher yielding securities over the past year 
during  management has acquired mortgage backed and investment securities in lieu of aggressively purchasing residential loans in order to provide the company with better overall yields without sacrificing credit quality 
these investments were also deemed by management to be a better fit for the balance sheet for asset liability purposes 
interest expense interest expense for increased  or compared to  generally due to increases in the average balances of deposits and borrowed funds as well as the rates paid on time deposits and borrowed funds 
the average balance of core and time deposits rose to  and  respectively  for as compared to  and  respectively  in  for increases of and  respectively 
the increase noted for as compared to relates to the attractiveness of the company s retail products and services in the marketplace it serves as well as reflecting some of the fallout from in market bank merger activity which displaced many customers who sought an alternative to their prior banking relationship primarily in the first half of this was beneficial to the company as well as many other community banks in the region 
the company has continued to closely manage its cost of deposits by continuing to seek methods of acquiring new core deposits and maintaining its current core deposits while prudently adding time deposits at reasonable rates in comparison to local markets and other funding alternatives  including borrowings 
the average balances of borrowed funds increased overall during as compared to  to  from  an increase of 
these increased borrowings were used to fund earning asset growth over the blended weighted average rate paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds was for as compared to in the overall weighted average rates paid on borrowed funds increased to approximately in from in this increase was reflective of the net cumulative effect of actions taken by the federal reserve between july and august of to increase the inter bank borrowing rate by basis points 
the company will continue to evaluate the use of borrowing as an alternative funding source for asset growth in future periods 
see asset liability management for further discussion of the competitive market for deposits and overall strategies for uses of borrowed funds 
the weighted average rates paid on interest bearing deposits was in as compared to in the overall cost of deposits increased primarily due to market competition for time deposits 
the level of competitive rates for time deposits in was consistent with the desire of many banks in the marketplace to attract new customers in a period of significant consumer disruption see earlier discussion of in market bank merger activity 
the company s cost of time deposits rose to in from in the overall impact on the cost of deposits was mitigated by the company s continued success in attracting core deposits ddas  nows  savings and money markets through its retail and promotional efforts during the year despite overall increases in economic rates and other competitive factors 
non interest income total non interest income increased  or in in comparison to customer service fees  which were  in as compared to  for  for an increase of  or  rose primarily due to growth in deposit accounts  primarily now and checking account portfolios 
also  in may  the company was granted regulatory approval to sell insurance annuities 
this and other brokerage related activities accounted for approximately  of the aforementioned increase in customer service fees 
loan servicing fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans were  and  respectively  in as compared to  and  respectively  in  a combined increase of  or 
the increase in loan gains for as compared to was generally reflective of the expanded capacity and actual residential mortgage originations and sales as the result of old colony mortgage which were included in the consolidated results of operations for months in as compared to months in as the company has been selling loans generally on a servicing released basis since  the portfolio of loans serviced for others has declined which has caused the continued drop in loan servicing income 
gains on sales of securities were  in as compared to  in for a decrease of  or 
the decrease in gains on securities in is reflective of management s decision to sell fewer securities for gains in as compared to non interest expenses non interest expenses for increased  or compared to included in this increase in was approximately  of non capitalizable  identifiable and quantifiable non recurring expenses which related to the company s conversion of its computer systems from an in house mainframe to a third party service bureau 
this expense was spread across various categories and is noted in the analyses below 
salaries and employee benefits increased or  primarily due to the acquisition of old colony mortgage in april approximately  increases related to branches opened brockton in may and canton november approximately  the conversion of computer systems to an outside service bureau  increases in commissions particularly commissions on insurance sales and estimates related to various other incentive compensation accruals  and other general increases in salaries  commissions paid and customer service related staff levels 
these increases correspond with the company s strategic focus of attracting core deposits and new customer relationships 
management also believes that a portion of the salaries expense increase  not previously specifically identified  is attributable to post conversion activity which has had a temporary impact on increasing overtime hours worked and overall staffing levels 
additionally  these increases are net of a curtailment gain of  which was the result of management s decision to freeze october  and terminate december  its pension plan 
this was recorded as a reduction in salaries and benefits expense in the fourth quarter of occupancy expenses decreased  or primarily due to the expiration of maintenance contracts on the company s prior mainframe system 
these decreases are net of the effect of increases relating to the acquisition of old colony mortgage approximately  the canton and brockton branches as previously noted approximately  and the system conversion 
other non interest expenses  including trust preferred expenses  also increased  or for in comparison to the aforementioned increases relates to the acquisition of old colony mortgage  the brockton and canton branches  the systems conversion  and service contracts on new computer system  in in addition to other inflationary and volume related increases 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses for was  as compared to  in the lower levels of provision were generally attributable to continued strength and improvements in other asset quality factors  such as delinquency  charge offs  non performing and watched assets that management uses to measure and evaluate the adequacy of loan loss reserve levels 
the resulting level of loan loss reserves were approximately of period end loans at december  as compared to 
at december  provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for was compared to in the lower effective tax rate in comparison to statutory rates for both periods is reflective of income earned by certain non bank subsidiaries which are taxed  for state tax purposes  at lower rates 
asset liability management the objective of asset liability management is to ensure that liquidity  capital and market risk are prudently managed 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the company s board of directors board 
the board delegates responsibility for asset liability management to the corporate asset liability management committee alco 
alco sets strategic directives that guide the day to day asset liability management activities of the company 
alco also reviews and approves all major funding  capital and market risk management programs 
alco is comprised of members of management and executive management of the company and the bank 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
the primary objective of interest rate risk management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board and by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying potential exposures and developing tactical plans to address such potential exposures 
the company quantifies its interest rate risk exposures using sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as a more simple gap analysis 
the company manages its interest rate exposures by generally using on balance sheet strategies  which is most easily accomplished through the management of the durations and rate sensitivities of the company s investments  including mortgage backed securities portfolios  and by extending or shortening maturities of borrowed funds 
additionally  pricing strategies  asset sales and  in some cases  hedge strategies are also considered in the evaluation and management of interest rate risk exposures 
the company uses simulation analysis to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a to year time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet positions under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to ramp up or down basis points over a month period  estimated net interest income for the next months should decline by less than 
the following table reflects the company s estimated exposure  as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next months  which does not materially differ from the impact on net income  on the above basis rate change estimated exposure as a basis points of net interest income interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and repricing characteristics of the on balance sheet and off balance sheet positions 
the interest rate gap analysis is prepared by scheduling all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions according to scheduled repricing or maturity 
interest rate gap analysis can be viewed as a short hand complement to simulation and valuation analysis 
the company s policy is to match  as well as possible  the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities 
generally  residential mortgage loans currently originated by the company are sold in the secondary market 
residential mortgage loans that the company currently originates  from time to time  or purchases for the company s own portfolio are primarily year  year  year and year adjustable rate mortgages and shorter term generally year or seasoned year fixed rate mortgages 
the company also emphasizes loans with terms to maturity or repricing of years or less  such as certain commercial mortgages  business loans  residential construction loans and home equity loans 
management desires to expand its interest earning asset base in future periods primarily through growth in the company s loan portfolio 
loans comprised approximately of the average interest earning assets in in the future  the company intends to continue to be competitive in the residential mortgage market but plans to place greater emphasis on home equity and commercial loans 
the company also historically has been and expects to remain active in pursuing wholesale opportunities to purchase loans 
during  and  the company acquired approximately   and  respectively  of residential first mortgages which are serviced by others 
the company has also used mortgage backed investments typically with weighted average lives of to years as a vehicle for fixed and adjustable rate investments and as an overall asset liability tool 
these securities have been highly liquid given current levels of prepayments in the underlying mortgage pools and  as a result  have provided the company with greater reinvestment flexibility 
one of the factors influencing earning asset levels and their yields since has been the intensity of prepayment activity on mortgage related assets which have been prompted by the very attractive refinancing opportunities that the market has presented consumers for the better part of the past three years 
this has contributed to the continued downward trend in asset yields in and this effect was offset in part by the acquisition origination of loans and investments at higher yields in  due to the rising interest rate environment which existed 
management does anticipate  however  given the early market trends and interest rate forecasts by economists  that prepayment activity and declining asset yield trends may develop in the level of the company s liquid assets and the mix of its investments may vary  depending upon management s judgment as to market trends  the quality of specific investment opportunities and the relative attractiveness of their maturities and yields 
management has been aggressively promoting the company s core deposit products since the first quarter of  particularly checking and now accounts 
the success of this program has favorably impacted the overall deposit growth to date  despite interest rate and general market pressures  and has helped the company to increase its customer base 
however  given the strong performance of mutual funds and the equity markets in general  the company and many of its peers have begun to see lower levels of growth in time deposits as compared to prior years as customers reflect their desire to increase their returns on investment 
this pressure has been exacerbated currently by the historically low long term economic interest rates 
management believes that the markets for future time deposit growth  particularly with terms in excess of years  will remain highly competitive 
management will continue to evaluate future funding strategies and alternatives accordingly as well as to continue to focus its efforts on attracting core  retail deposit relationships 
the company is also a voluntary member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of boston 
this borrowing capacity assists the company in managing its asset liability growth because  at times  the company considers it more advantageous to borrow money from the fhlb of boston than to raise money through non core deposits ie  certificates of deposit 
borrowed funds totaled  at december  compared to  at december  these borrowings are primarily comprised of fhlb of boston advances and have primarily funded residential loan originations and purchases as well as mortgage backed investments and investment securities 
also  the company obtained funding in june through the issuance of trust preferred securities which carry a higher interest rate than similar fhlb borrowings but at the same time are included as capital  without diluting earnings per share and are tax deductible 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
the following table sets forth maturity and repricing information relating to interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the balance of such accounts has been allocated among the various periods based upon the terms and repricing intervals of the particular assets and liabilities 
for example  fixed rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  regardless of available for sale classification  are shown in the table in the time periods corresponding to projected principal amortization computed based on their respective weighted average maturities and weighted average rates using prepayment data available from the secondary mortgage market 
adjustable rate loans and securities are allocated to the period in which the rates would be next adjusted 
the following table does not reflect partial or full prepayment of certain types of loans and investment securities prior to scheduled contractual maturity 
additionally  all securities or borrowings which are callable at the option of the issuer or lender are reflected in the following table based upon the likelihood of call options being exercised by the issuer on certain investments or borrowings in a most likely interest rate environment 
since regular passbook savings and now accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  such accounts have been included in the other savings accounts category and are assumed to mature within months 
this table does not include non interest bearing deposits 
while this table presents a cumulative negative gap position in the month to year horizon  the company considers its earning assets to be more sensitive to interest rate movements than its liabilities 
in general  assets are tied to increases that are immediately impacted by interest rate movements while deposit rates are generally driven by market area and demand which tend to be less sensitive to general interest rate changes 
in addition  other savings accounts and money market accounts are substantially stable core deposits  although subject to rate changes 
a substantial core balance in these type of accounts is anticipated to be maintained over time

they are also shown at amortized cost 
liquidity and capital resources payments and prepayments on the company s loan and mortgage backed investment portfolios  sales of fixed rate residential loans  increases in deposits  borrowed funds and maturities of various investments comprise the company s primary sources of liquidity 
the company is also a voluntary member of the fhlb of boston and  as such  is entitled to borrow an amount up to the value of its qualified collateral that has not been pledged to outside sources 
qualified collateral generally consists of residential first mortgage loans  securities issued  insured or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies  and funds on deposit at the fhlb of boston 
short term advances may be used for any sound business purpose  while long term advances may be used only for the purpose of providing funds to finance housing 
at december   the company had approximately  in unused borrowing capacity that is contingent upon the purchase of additional fhlb of boston stock 
use of this borrowing capacity is also impacted by capital adequacy considerations 
the company regularly monitors its asset quality to determine the level of its loan loss reserves through periodic credit reviews by members of the company s management credit committee 
the management credit committee  which reports to the executive committee of the company s board of directors  also works on the collection of non accrual loans and disposition of real estate acquired by foreclosure 
the allowance for possible loan losses is determined by the management credit committee after consideration of several key factors including  without limitation potential risk in the current portfolio  levels and types of non performing assets and delinquency  levels of potential problem loans  which generally have varying degrees of loan collateral and repayment issues  on the watched asset reports 
workout approach and financial condition of borrowers are also key considerations to the evaluation of non performing loans 
non performing assets were  at december   compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the company s percentage of delinquent loans to total loans was at december   as compared to 
at december  the non performing asset and delinquency statistics noted above as of december  were adversely impacted by a single commercial loan relationship and an associated residential mortgage with total balances of approximately  if this relationship were excluded  the non performing assets and delinquency ratios would have been  and  respectively  which were more in line with the comparable results at december  management believes that while delinquency rates and non performing assets remain at relatively low levels  these factors are at historic lows  and at some point in the future a continued economic slowdown would likely result in future increases in problem assets and ultimately loan loss provisions 
management continues to monitor the overall economic environment and its potential effects on future credit quality on an ongoing basis 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments to originate  purchase and sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market amounting to  and  respectively 
the company also has outstanding commitments to grant advances under existing home equity lines of credit amounting to  unadvanced commitments under outstanding commercial and construction loans totaled  as of december  the company believes it has adequate sources of liquidity to fund these commitments

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements of the company and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which generally require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation

as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for possible loan losses and other than temporary impairment of investments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for possible loan losses which is established through a charge to the provision for possible loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for possible loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration  among other factors  such as local industry trends  management s ongoing review of individual loans  trends in levels of watched or criticized assets  an evaluation of results of examinations by regulatory authorities and analyses of historical trends in chargeoffs and delinquencies 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for possible loan losses 
refer to the discussion of allowance for possible loan losses in the business section for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for possible loan losses 
management records an investment impairment charge at the point it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred  management reviews information about the underlying investment that is publicly available  analysts reports  applicable industry data and other pertinent information 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future
