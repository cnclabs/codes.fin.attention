revenues were affected by the sale in february  of the human resource product line 
fiscal therefore reflects mix of full and partial years of product line activity 
for comparison purposes  revenues for fiscal  and have been adjusted to exclude the human resource product line activity 
this revenue is referred to as adjusted revenue 
ross systems  inc and subsidiaries comparisons of both adjusted revenue and total revenue follow below in thousands estimated adjusted revenues actual revenues year ended year ended revenue comparison june  june  revenues software product licenses       consulting and other services       maintenance       reimbursable expenses     total revenues       adjusted revenues  as defined above  were slightly increased at  in fiscal from  in fiscal adjusted revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in adjusted software product license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal  and decreased from fiscal to adjusted consulting revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal  and decreased from fiscal to adjusted maintenance revenues from first year and renewed maintenance agreements  both of which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  decreased from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to total actual revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal revenues represented a decrease from revenues of  in software product license revenues increased from fiscal to fiscal  and decreased from fiscal to consulting revenues decreased from fiscal to fiscal  and decreased from fiscal to maintenance revenues from first year and renewed maintenance agreements  both of which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  decreased from fiscal to fiscal and decreased from fiscal to maintenance agreements are renewed annually by most of the company s maintenance customers 
this decrease primarily reflects the absence of the maintenance revenue attributable the hr payroll product line in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior year which includes nine months of hr payroll maintenance 
in addition  some maintenance contracts expired without renewal 
reimbursable expenses decreased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  and decreased from fiscal to software product license revenues in the north american market decreased by in fiscal the company believes that this decrease is a continuation of the industry wide slow down in erp software sales in north america over the last two years 
in the european market  the company s software license sales have grown by over the prior year 
this was due to a combination of improved marketing of the company s products in some regions  and a perceived slight improvement in the software sales environment in europe when compared to the prior year 
software license sales in the asia pacific rim region increased by to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  which was due primarily to an increase in sales through the company s distributor in japan 
within europe  most of the increases in software product license revenues were experienced in spain and the benelux  while sales in the uk were slightly down 
revenues from consulting and other services which are recognized as performed correlate with software product license revenues which are recognized upon delivery  so that when software product license revenues decrease  future period services revenues generally decrease as a result 
in fiscal  consulting and other services revenues decreased  from fiscal results 
services revenues in north america were affected by the absence of revenue associated with the hr payroll product line  and hampered by fewer new customers  due to lower new license revenues 
in the european market  services revenues were flat in comparison to the prior year  bolstered in part by some additional activity related to the euro conversion 
fiscal consulting and other services revenues decreased  or  over fiscal results 
as a percentage of total revenues  the company s international operations grew to in fiscal and remained relatively consistent at and in fiscal years and respectively 
the revenue growth in reflects the increases in the company s share of the spain and japanese markets 
ross systems  inc and subsidiaries the company s largest pacific rim contract represents a distributor agreement with a japanese distributor whereby the distributor has an exclusive license to reproduce and sell certain ross products in the pacific rim 
the company negotiated agreements whereby annual minimum royalties of million   and million were earned during fiscal  and  respectively 
the changes in this source of revenue reflect an improving market in fiscal  and a weakening of demand in fiscal year revenues have been derived from a relatively large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for more than of revenues during fiscal  or the company s customers are evenly spread among the industry verticals within the process manufacturing market 
reimbursable expenses 
prior to january   the company recorded reimbursement by its customers for out of pocket expenses as a decrease to cost of services 
the company s results of operations for the fiscal years june    and have been reclassified for comparable purposes in accordance with the emerging issues task force release  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred

costs of software product licenses 
costs of software product licenses include expenses related to royalties paid to third parties and product documentation and packaging 
third party royalty expenses will vary from quarter to quarter based on the mix of third party products being sold 
costs of software product licenses for fiscal increased by to  from fiscal this increase was due to increased third party royalties associated with the larger volume of software license sales in the  and a higher third party content in software license sales 
in fiscal  costs of software product licenses decreased by to  from  in the prior year 
this decrease was due to the overall reduced software volumes 
as a percent of software revenue  third party royalties comprised in fiscal  compared to for fiscal  and for fiscal costs of consulting  maintenance and other services 
costs of consulting  maintenance and other services include expenses related to consulting and training personnel  personnel providing customer support pursuant to maintenance agreements  and other costs of sales 
from time to time the company also uses outside consultants to supplement company personnel in meeting peak customer consulting demands 
costs of consulting  maintenanceand other services  net of reimbursable expenses  decreased to  from  and decreased in fiscal from  in fiscal the lower levels of expenditure in fiscal reflect the savings in employee costs as a result of the significant headcount reduction in affecting  and the absence of services and customer support costs relating to the hr payroll product line sold in the prior year 
the decline in fiscal is composed primarily of a  decrease in third party service costs  and a decrease of  in employee expenses 
the fiscal levels of personnel in services and customer support have produced improved productivity for the year  resulting in improving margins 
gross profit margins 
the company s gross profit margins resulting from consulting  maintenance and other services revenues for fiscal   and were   and  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit margins from fiscal to  and fiscal to is due primarily to the greater proportion of maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenues comprised of services revenues in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal maintenance revenues are less affected by cyclical economic factors  whilst consulting revenues will vary according to current market and economic conditions 
consulting  maintenance and other service revenues represented of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal  and of total revenues in fiscal this was due to the decrease in maintenance and consulting revenues in associated with the sale of the hr payroll product line in the third quarter of  and an increase in license revenues in fiscal over fiscal software product license sales and marketing expenses 
software product license sales and marketing expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and decreased by  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decreases for fiscal  and are a result of the decreased headcount of approximately less marketing and sales personnel in fiscal years and over fiscal  and lower marketing expenditure 
marketing expenditure was increased towards the end of fiscal as the company s planned new initiatives in this area started to take effect 
however this increase did not materially impact the year s overall expenditure 
ross systems  inc and subsidiaries product development expenses 
product development expenditures for the past three years were as follows in thousands year ended june  product development    amortization of previously capitalized software development costs    expenses  excluding amortization    capitalized software development costs incurred during year    total expenditures    total expenditures as a percent of total revenues capitalized software  net of amortization  as a percentage of total expenditures product development expense was virtually unchanged in fiscal  as compared to fiscal in fiscal  product development expense increased from fiscal this increase in expense was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized development costs in fiscal of from  in fiscal  and a decrease in fiscal of from  in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  fiscal total development expense decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal  product development expenditures were focused on expanding integrated internet erp functionality while incorporating some of the latest technologies available 
not included in the above expenditure was a fourth quarter  non cash charge of  for previously capitalized software costs written off due to technology changes and changes in product direction 
see note r in the notes to the consolidated financial statements below 
product development expenditures during fiscal and were primarily focused on new internet enabled modules and continued enhancements to the underlying technology of released products and developing new web enabled products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  in fiscal over fiscal  and decreased to  in fiscal over the savings in costs achieved in and are primarily due to the closure or consolidation of several regional offices  and a reduction in employee costs associated with a lower headcount 
provision for doubtful accounts 
in fiscal   and  the company recorded provisions of   and  respectively 
these provisions represent management s best estimate of the doubtful accounts for each period 
the significantly higher provision in fiscal year reflects the higher accounts receivable balances in that year  commensurate with revenues exceeding million for fiscal the lower provision in fiscal was made possible by tighter and better controls over accounts receivable collections coupled with lower accounts receivable balances in line with revenues exceeding million for fiscal amortization of other assets 
amortization of other assets was zero in fiscal compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
this reflects the change in accounting treatment due to compliance with the new accounting pronouncement  sfas no 
 on goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note f in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page f assets reviewed for diminution in value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 include goodwill relating to the acquisition of hipoint systems inc in fiscal  the acquisition of bizware  inc in  and the acquisition of the company s spanish distributor in there was no impairment of these assets 
non recurring items 
in october of  the company reorganized its european presence and adopted an indirect sales model in france by terminating its ownership and control of the french subsidiary due to the chronic and sustained losses and negative cash flows suffered by the french subsidiary 
at that time  management recorded what they deemed to be adequate reserves related to the possible future costs for the change of presence in france by deferring the gain associated with divesting net liabilities in this liquidating transaction 
in the fourth ross systems  inc and subsidiaries quarter of fiscal  it became clear that some of the risk relating to the france office closure had been resolved 
as a result the company recorded a non recurring gain of  arising from the reduction of the reserve described above 
at the end of the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an expense of  to cover separation costs associated with employees employed in sales  marketing  services  and product development in north america and europe 
during q fiscal the company recorded a  expense to cover the liability arising from separation costs associated with employees employed in sales  marketing  services and product development in north america and europe 
non cash capitalized software impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company made a major change in technology direction 
the internet related functionality of the irenaissance product was re directed from the java based initial development used in the resynt product line to the microsoft 
net technology 
a new  formal development relationship with microsoft was launched to support the requirements of the new technology direction 
this strategic re direction was based on the company s belief that the 
net technology will serve the company and its customers better in the future  due to fuller market penetration  better standards of compatibility  and superior technical adaptability 
the result of this change was that prior development in the former java environment became obsolete 
effective april   the amount of  representing all unamortized software project balances relating to this  was expensed 
on april   the company announced the general availability of gembase version this version of gembase  the gl language used for the development of the irenaissance products  contained major functionality differences to prior versions  rendering all prior versions obsolete 
as a result  development and maintenance of all versions prior to were discontinued and no further sales using these versions would be contemplated 
in addition  customers using these versions would be strongly encouraged to upgrade to version because the company no longer supports development of any gembase release lower than version upgrades to the version would be strongly supported and to encourage and facilitate customers upgrading  the product was designed to make the transition straight forward 
since gembase versions lower than would not contribute any further revenue to the company  even in the short term  the related unamortized software project balances amounting to  were expensed 
on may  the company announced the release of irenaissance version this version was significantly changed from the prior versions 
previous to this release  upgrades from any version less than to the latest version were technically challenging resulting in an environment not conducive to customer upgrades 
version offered a straight forward upgrade capability to customers on previous versions 
in addition  version contained a new engine at its core  which significantly changed the way the software operated internally and resulted in improved operating efficiencies 
since customers on versions lower than could now upgrade without difficulty  the company was able to discontinue the development and support of all versions prior to no further sales using these versions would be contemplated 
this had the effect of rendering all releases of irenaissance which were lower than obsolete 
since irenaissance versions lower than would not contribute any further license revenue to the company  the related unamortized software project balances amounting to  were expensed 
during may  the company terminated further work on general enhancements of the cobol technology based renaissance classic product line and a twofold decision was made  to continue working with specific customers on custom product development  and to introduce a general sales program of free software license upgrade from the classic product to the latest release of the irenaissance product line for customers who remain on maintenance 
the company will continue to support those customers who remain active users until they schedule their upgrade conversion to irenaissance 
since no future revenues are expected from the general enhancements capitalized to date  the aggregate  unamortized software project balances amounting to  were expensed 
the aggregate value of unamortized software written down in the fourth quarter of fiscal was  this action has no effect on the company s cash position or cashflows

an aggregate net increase in non cash charges for depreciation  amortization  capitalized software cost impairment  and provisions for uncollectible accounts of  is offset by an increase in the company s loss of  this reflects primarily the non cash charge of  for software assets impaired which decreased the company s earnings but did not affect the company s cash position 
before inclusion of changes in operating assets and liabilities  the company s cash provided by operating activities increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal an aggregate decrease in the changes in operating assets and liabilities  including accounts receivable  deferred revenues  pre paid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses of  during fiscal  was due primarily to the decrease in cash provided from accounts receivable and deferred revenues of  from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal this change in accounts receivable and deferred revenues was attributable mainly to the non recurring effect of the disposition of the hr payroll product line in fiscal  which included certain accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances 
an accounts payable and accrued expenses reduction of  in fiscal  was in line with a similar reduction of  in fiscal the net cash used for investing purposes has decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this represents a decrease in net computer software costs capitalized in of  and an increase in property and equipment purchases of  the reduction in capitalized computer software costs reflects the absence of development relating to the hr payroll product line which was sold in fiscal in conjunction with the product line disposition the company transferred net assets and liabilities realizing from the transaction  of net cash flow in fiscal cash flows from financing activities decreased  from net repayments in the prior year of  to net repayments in the current year of  in fiscal  repayments under the credit line were less by  than in fiscal this reflects the  repaid in fiscal compared to the  repaid in fiscal in fiscal there were no significant capital receipts or repayments

other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill attributable to each of the companies reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units with its carrying value 
the fair values of these reporting units were determined using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based on historical and projected financial information 
the initial phase of the impairment tests were performed within six months of adoption of sfas or december   and are required at least annually thereafter 
on an ongoing basis absent of any impairment indicators  we expect to perform our impairment tests during the june quarter  in connection with our annual planning process

other matters risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also impair our business operations 
our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by  and the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
you should also refer to the other information included in this annual report on form k and the other information  our financial statements and the related notes incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
the company s software product license revenues can fluctuate depending upon such factors as overall trends in the united states and international economies  new product introductions by the company  hardware vendors and other software vendors as well as customer buying patterns 
because the company typically ships software products within a short period after orders are received  and therefore maintains a relatively small backlog  any weakening in customer demand can have an almost immediate adverse impact on revenues and operating results 
moreover  a substantial portion of the revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of sales and tends to be realized in the latter part of the quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause substantial fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
finally  certain agreements signed during a quarter may not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria resulting in deferral of such revenue to future periods 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variation in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our business maybe adversely impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
weak economic conditions worldwide have contributed to the current technology industry slow down 
this may impact our business resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition  which may result in higher overhead costs  as a percentage of revenues 
additionally  this uncertainty may make it difficult for our customers to forecast future business activities 
this could create challenges to our ability to grow our business profitably 
if the economic or market conditions further deteriorate  this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
we may face increased competition and our financial performance and future growth depend upon sustaining a leadership position in our product functionality 
competitive challenges faced by ross are likely to arise from a number of factors  including industry volatility resulting from rapid development and maturation of technologies  industry consolidation and increasing price competition in the face of worsening economic conditions 
although there are fewer competitors in our target markets than previously  our failure to compete successfully against those remaining could harm our business operating results and financial condition 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our operating results  and speculation in the press or investment community 
in addition  our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and may be negatively affected by unfavorable global economic conditions 
ross systems  inc and subsidiaries our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in litigation and administrative proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
retaining key management and employees are critical to our success 
our success depends upon retaining and recruiting highly qualified employees and management personnel 
however  we may face severe challenges in attracting and retaining such employees 
although our turnover is historically low  if our ability to maintain a stable workforce is significantly handicapped  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange the company has a worldwide presence and as such maintains offices and derives revenues from sources overseas 
for fiscal  international revenue as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 
the company s international business is subject to typical risks of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in fiscal was not material 
interest rates the company s exposure to interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash equivalents and certain debt obligations 
the company invests in financial instruments with original maturates of three months or less 
any interest earned on these investments is recorded as interest income on the company s statement of operations 
because of the short maturity of the company s investments  a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
certain of the company s debt obligations include a variable rate of interest 
a significant  near term change in interest rates could materially affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company did not engage in any derivative hedging transactions
