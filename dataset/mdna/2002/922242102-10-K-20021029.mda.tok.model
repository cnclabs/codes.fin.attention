the company elected early adoption of sfas no 
effective august  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in april  the emerging issue task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  vendor income statement characterization of consideration from a vendor to a retailer 
the consensus creates a presumption that consideration paid by a vendor to a retailer  such as slotting fees and cooperative advertising  should be classified as a reduction of revenue in the vendor s income statement instead of an expense unless certain criteria are met 
this consensus is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after december  the company adopted eitf effective august  accordingly  certain charges for cooperative advertising are reflected as a reduction of revenue 
cooperative advertising expenses for the years ended july    and were   and  respectively 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 however it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  sfas no 
provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as held and used until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb for the disposal of a segment of a business and extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity  increasing the likelihood that a disposition will represent a discontinued operation 
further  sfas no 
requires operating losses from a component of an entity to be recognized in the period in which they occur rather than as of the measurement date as previously required by apb sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will be applying the provisions of sfas no

other income expense

to the extent that the company generates sufficient ordinary income in the future  approximately  of the valuation allowance may be further reversed as a reduction of income tax expense and thereby reduce the effective tax rate 
approximately million of the valuation allowance would only be reversed and reflected as a reduction of income tax expense if the company generates qualifying capital gain income  which is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future 
weighted average shares outstanding

the company s effective tax rate for fiscal is less than the federal statutory rate due to changes in the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources the company funds its activities principally from cash flow generated from operations and a credit facility with an institutional lender 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of july   compared to  as of july  the cash equivalents are invested in money market funds which consist of investment grade short term instruments 
the company currently plans to continue investing cash equivalents in this manner 
net working capital as of july  was  compared to  as of july   and the company s current ratio which measures the liquidity of the company by comparing the current assets as a percentage of current liabilities was as of july   compared to as of july  the slight decrease in working capital was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents  deferred taxes and an increase in current liabilities  largely offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the company has a credit agreement with a major bank providing a  revolving line of credit with separate sub limits of  for the issuance of commercial letters of credit and  for actual cash borrowing 
the agreement is secured by substantially all the assets of the company and carries an interest rate equal to the banks reference rate which is equivalent to prime and offers certain libor based interest options 
the agreement requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants 
borrowings for letters of credit have varied  typically reaching the highest levels in the pre christmas periods and the spring seasons 
the outstanding balance on letters of credit on july  was  leaving approximately  available for issuance of letters of credit  inclusive of a separate sub limit of  available for cash borrowings 
since the company expects to finance its operations from operating cash flow and existing cash reserves  the company does not anticipate borrowing cash available under the line throughout its fiscal year end 
to the extent that terms and conditions are favorable  the company intends to renegotiate its credit agreement with the bank for an extended period on or before expiration of the current agreement which expires may  the company had long term debt of  as of july   compared to  as of july   with the decrease due to a payment made during the year 
lease commitments the company leases warehouse and office facilities under an operating lease that requires minimum monthly payments of  and also provides for the lessee to pay property taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
the lease expires on december  and is subject to escalation every eighteen months based on changes in the consumer price index 
the company has an option to extend this lease for sixty months based on the escalation amount determined above and the company has a right of first offer to purchase this facility 
the company also leases additional warehouse space in another building under an operating lease requiring minimum monthly payments of  which amount includes property taxes  insurance  repairs and maintenance  and utilities 
this agreement expires june   with the company having an option to extend this lease for an additional twelve month period 
annual future minimum lease payments under existing operating leases are as follows operating leases in thousands years ending july and thereafter total minimum lease payments total rent expense was   and  for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
sensitivity the company does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currency of its suppliers has any significant material and adverse impact on the company s ability to purchase products at agreed upon prices 
typically  the company and its suppliers negotiate prices in us dollars and payments to suppliers are also made in us dollars 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the value of the dollar will not have an impact upon the company in the future 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment in short term instruments and money market funds 
critical accounting policies use of estimates financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements include allowances made against accounts receivable  reserves taken against inventory  accruals for sales returns and allowances  warranty  product liability claims  and other litigation related matters 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the estimated future uncollectability of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks that have been identified by reviewing current customer information 
inventory inventories consist primarily of finished products purchased in bulk categories to be sold to our customers 
we state our inventories at lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to the future selling prices and demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
in addition  an allowance for obsolete inventory is maintained to reflect the expected net realizable value of inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped 
sales are shown net of estimated allowances for returns  discounts  and cooperative advertising 
warranties returns the company records a liability for the estimated costs of product warranties and returns at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s warranty and returns obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
the estimate of costs to service its warranty and returns obligation is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim and returns activity or increased costs with servicing those claims  its warranty and returns accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
product liability the company is involved in various claims arising from the sale of products in the normal course of business 
the company carries product liability insurance on its products 
under the insurance policy  any settlements on product liability claims require the company to pay a deductible  depending on the type of product 
management and its legal counsel periodically review the claims for merit and for those claims that are deemed to be of merit the company estimates its portion of the potential settlement and provides an accrual for that amount 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income 
our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
future liquidity and financial position the company intends to continue to focus upon building and maintaining its existing product lines 
the company also plans to continue to devote resources toward the pursuit and development of new products 
in addition  management continues to explore the possibility of making selected acquisitions of other companies or products that would offer a strategic fit with the company s existing products and its sourcing and distribution channels in the mass market 
in fiscal  the company began expanding international distribution and is developing additional distribution arrangements in order to take further advantage of growth opportunities that management believes exist for its products outside the united states 
international sales grew to over of total sales in fiscal management believes that its current cash position  funds available under existing banking arrangements  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s presently projected cash and working capital requirements for the next fiscal year assuming continued financial performance at present levels 
additional factors that could affect operating results the following factors  together with other information contained elsewhere herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
loss of a major customer could immediately and severely curtail distribution outlets 
in the past three fiscal years  the company has had several customers which accounted for a majority of the company s sales 
as is customary in the industry  the company does not have long term contracts with any of its customers 
the loss of  or a reduction in business from  any of its major customers could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because a large percentage of the company s accounts receivables are due from the major customers  the failure of any of them to make timely payments with respect to its account could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
if we cannot control prices  our very price sensitive customers will purchase from our competitors instead of us 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and there are no significant technological or manufacturing barriers to entry for most product categories other than instant canopies and springless trampolines 
while the company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are price  quality of product  brand recognition  accessibility and customer service  the company s primary customers  mass merchandisers  are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  the company must continually monitor and control its costs while refining its products to maintain its market position 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to provide its products at prices which are competitive  or that it can continue to design and market products that appeal to consumers even if price competitive 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  smaller retailers may be acquired by  receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger  well established and well financed companies 
the company also competes to a lesser degree with manufacturers who sell directly to our customers 
consumer demand could shift away from our products 
the company must continually anticipate the emergence of  and adapt its products to  the popular demands of consumers 
no assurance can be given  however  that consumer demand for the company s product categories in general  or the company s products in particular  will continue into the future 
a reduction in the demand for these products could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in government regulations could hurt the company s business 
the consumer retail industry is regulated by many agencies including but not limited to  the consumer product safety commission and the california department of food and agriculture division of measurement standards 
the nature of any new laws and regulations and the manner in which existing and new laws and regulations may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined 
the enforcement of existing laws and regulations and the adoption of any future laws or regulations might decrease the demand for the company s products  impose taxes or other costly technical requirements or otherwise increase the cost of doing business which could hurt the company s business 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on the company s business 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may negatively affect the company s stock price 
the company s quarterly results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors  not all of which are under the company s control 
some of the factors that could cause the company s revenues and operating results to fluctuate include the following the mix of products sold  the introduction of new products or delays in such introductions  the introduction or announcement of new products by the company s competitors  customer acceptance of new products  shipment delays  competitive pricing pressures  the adverse effect of suppliers or the company s failure  and allegations of their failure  to comply with applicable regulations  the availability and cost to its suppliers of raw materials  the introduction of its products into new markets  unanticipated changes in the timing of customer promotions  increased operating expenses  and economic conditions in general and in the retail sector in particular 
it is possible that in some future periods the company s results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could result in a decline in the value of the company s common stock 
reliance on foreign suppliers to source the company s products 
the company s products are primarily sourced from suppliers located in asia with whom the company does not have long term contractual agreements 
if the company were unable to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers that would allow it to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise on acceptable commercial terms  its business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  the company may not be able to obtain its products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in order to sustain its operating margins 
although management presently believes that other suppliers could be obtained in such instances  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain products and supplies on substantially similar terms  including cost  in the future 
in addition  purchasing products from foreign suppliers subjects the company to the general risks of doing business abroad 
these risks include potential delays in shipment  work stoppages  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in import duties and tariffs  changes in foreign regulations and political instability 
a significant portion of the company s products  including various models of its in line skates  are manufactured in mainland china  which trades with the united states under a normal trade relations ntr trade status 
while the company believes that alternative manufacturing sources could be found  maintaining existing costs will depend upon these products continuing to be treated under ntr tariff rates 
from time to time  the us has threatened to rescind ntr tariff rates and impose trade sanctions on certain goods manufactured in china 
to date  no such sanctions have been imposed that have affected the company or its products  however there can be no assurance with regard to the possible imposition of sanctions in the future 
in addition  economic conditions in asia could have a material and adverse impact upon the company s ability to procure products from suppliers 
any economic and financial difficulties experienced in asia could cause a delay or inability to procure products from the company s suppliers which could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
however  the company may be able to move production quickly to alternate sources in response to economic or political circumstances that might arise in any particular country 
the company s product mix subjects it to potentially large product liability claims 
due to the nature of its products  the company is subject to product liability claims  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
coverage is on a claims made basis  and is subject to certain deductibles 
although the company believes that it has adequate liability insurance for risks arising in the normal course of business  including product liability insurance with respect to all of its products  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future 
successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
our expenses could increase dramatically in defense of  or due to the loss of  any of our trademarks and proprietary rights 
there are risks inherent in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  including those associated with patent issues and marketability 
potential liability from patent and other intellectual property infringements can have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
with respect to the company s own patents  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  the company considers such proprietary rights as critical to its success  and relies on patent and trademark law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  customers  partners and others to protect its proprietary rights 
the company holds or has pending certain design patents and utility patents and employs various trademarks  trade names  including its own logos  in the packaging and advertising of its products 
the company has registered the variflex  static  quik shade and airzone trademarks in the united states  and actively protects against any unauthorized use in any other parts of the world 
registration of various other trademarks of the company s products are pending 
effective patent  trademark  service mark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products and services are made available 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate the company s patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against the company 
the company has been subject to claims and expects to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of its business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by the company 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
current licenses held under the rocket power  spongebob squarepants and jimmy neutron brand are short term contractual arrangements 
any extension or modification of these licenses is subject to the approval of both the licensor and variflex 
the rocket power and spongebob squarepants license both expire on december  while the jimmy neutron license expires on december  the loss or expiration of these licenses could require us to immediately discontinue sales that account for a significant amount of revenues 
our expansion into new business areas might not be cost effective 
the company is expanding its operations by developing and promoting new or complementary products  expanding the breadth and depth of products and services offered or expanding the acquisition of new or complementary businesses  products or technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to expand its efforts and operations in a cost effective or timely manner or that any such efforts would increase overall market acceptance 
furthermore  any new business or product line launched by the company that is not favorably received by consumers could damage the company s reputation or its various brand names 
expansion of the company s operations in this manner would also require significant additional development and operations expenses and would strain the company s management  financial and operational resources 
the lack of market acceptance of such efforts or the company s inability to generate satisfactory revenues from such expanded businesses or products to offset their cost could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of its senior management and other key personnel  particularly raymond jay h 
losi ii  who has entered into an employment agreement with the company  which currently is on a month to month basis 
the loss of mr 
losi ii could have a material and adverse effect on the company 
although the company carries a  life insurance policy on mr 
losi ii  no assurance can be given that the proceeds will be sufficient to protect against such a loss 
the company s performance also depends on the company s ability to retain and motivate its other officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations 
other than the aforementioned exceptions  the company has long term employment agreements with only a few of its key personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
the failure to retain and attract the necessary technical  managerial  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
a product recall on one of our products could require us to take an unanticipated charge 
certain of the company s products are subject to regulation by the federal consumer products safety commission the cpsc  and may therefore be subject to recall request by the cpsc 
in october  the company announced that it was voluntarily recalling certain of its x games helmets which did not comply with all applicable cpsc standards 
this recall was completed in fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded an estimated product recall charge relating to these helmets  which was adjusted downward in fiscal although the company is not aware of any current proceeding by the cpsc that would result in the recall of the company s products  any such proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its investments in short term instruments and money market funds 
these investments are subject to risks associated with the level of volatility within the various financial markets  changes in interest rates  the condition of the united states and world economies and many other factors 
the company also has interest rate sensitivity related to its revolving direct advance line of credit 
the company currently has no derivative financial instruments 
as of july   a change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
