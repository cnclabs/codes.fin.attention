critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those relating to revenue recognition 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based on factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
reserve for returns  chargebacks and discounts and allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
as of december   the reserve for product returns  chargebacks and discounts is of the total amount of receivables 
we determined this valuation based on an analysis of product shipments  new and total prescription trends  and the amount of product in the distribution channel 
every quarter we analyze this reserve and make adjustments based on actual returns  chargebacks  discounts and product distribution sell through 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  is of the total receivable and is established by reviewing the accounts receivable aging on an individual customer basis 
based on this review  the allowance is established and adjusted quarterly as necessary 
acquired product rights and amortization we amortize pharmaceutical products over the estimated economic useful life  generally years 
we assess the useful life on a product by product basis based on the estimated marketability and future sales volume  which are dependent on a variety of factors  including the introduction of new products by competitors and continued use of existing product 
in practice  pharmaceutical prescription products are long lived because doctors continue to prescribe drugs that they have grown comfortable with and where the product risk profile is well known 
factors affecting results of operations we incurred losses of million  million and million in the years ended december   and marks the first complete year of operations under our new management and the new strategic direction of owning and licensing pharmaceutical products as opposed to co promoting them 
while we have realigned our expense structure with expected revenues  many of our expenses are fixed  especially in the short term  and our revenues are variable 
because of this  our results of operations have varied during our short operating history and we expect that they may continue to fluctuate  perhaps significantly  in the future 
in addition  other factors may cause fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations in the future  including the following the success or failure of our sales force in distributing our current product line and changes in market acceptance of those products  excessive and unexpected generic competition to the products we offer  manufacturing problems that limit our ability to acquire salable product on time and at reasonable terms  our ability to acquire new products  legislative changes that affect our products and the way we market them and our ability to comply with new or existing regulations  the amount and timing of expenditures for the expansion of our operations  competitive products and or companies that target our market niche and are successful in reaching our market  changes in the competitive environment that could cause us to change our pricing or marketing strategy  and changes in the economic and market environment generally or in the health care industry 
to the extent our revenues do not cover our expenses  we may be unable to reduce spending commitments in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall and may experience unanticipated losses 
as a result of these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet the expectations of investors 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our working capital was million up million from december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  in our short history we have had two primary sources of liquidity revenues from product sales  educational grants and related party sources and proceeds from private placements of our equity securities and the initial public offering of common stock 
we have generated million in revenues since our inception 
between january and february we issued  shares of series a preferred stock equivalent to  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in addition  in march  we issued million of short term notes and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in a private placement for net proceeds of million 
in  we repaid all principal and interest outstanding 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  providing us with proceeds  net of underwriting fees and offering expenses  of approximately million 
all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding on june  automatically converted into  shares of common stock upon the sale of common stock in the offering 
in july  the underwriters exercised in full their over allotment option  and we issued an additional  shares of common stock providing us with net proceeds of approximately million 
in august  we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock providing us with net proceeds of million 
in addition to operating expenses  our primary use of funds has been and will continue to be to fund capital expenditures and to obtain the rights to market and distribute products 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
the usage was primarily due to the net loss of million and changes in various elements of working capital  most notably accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of a conscious decision to extend our terms of trade in the latter part of to give us a competitive advantage with our customers at little cost 
in  the cash used in operating activities was roughly equivalent to that year s net loss 
in  cash usage was primarily due to the net loss offset by non cash changes such as amortization and write downs 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the same periods 
in  investing activities consisted primarily of product and license acquisitions 
in  investing activities consisted of equipment and other asset purchases 
in  investment activity was comprised of net capital expenditures and license acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million respectively for the same periods 
in  financing activities were comprised of the private placements referred to above and stock option exercises 
in  financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  short term notes and warrants 
we believe that based on our current performance and future plans  our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures and meet our debt service commitments for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities 
we currently do not have any lines of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot give you any assurances that we will be able to raise any such capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to women first or at all 
the extent of our needs for additional liquidity will depend on our future operating performance  which is itself dependent on a number of factors  many of which we cannot control  including prevailing economic conditions  availability of other sources of liquidity  and financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting our business and operations
