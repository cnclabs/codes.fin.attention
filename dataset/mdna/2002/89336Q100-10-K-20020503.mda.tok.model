critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise inventory and return costs  useful lives of fixed assets  the value of long lived assets and goodwill  store opening and closing costs  and provision for income taxes

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily from retail sales of merchandise comprised of prerecorded music including compact discs and audio cassettes  video including dvd and prerecorded videocassettes  video games and other complementary products including electronics  accessories  blank tapes and cd rs 
revenue is recognized at the point of sale to the consumer  at which time payment is tendered 
there are no provisions for uncollectible amounts since payment is received at the time of sale 
reductions of revenue for returns by customers are generally provided at the point of return due to infrequency and occurrence within short intervals of the sale and immateriality to the financial statements 
merchandise inventory and return costs inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the average cost method 
the company is entitled to return merchandise purchased from major vendors for credit against other purchases from these vendors 
these vendors often reduce the credit with a merchandise return charge ranging from to of the original merchandise purchase price depending on the type of merchandise being returned 
the company records actual and estimated merchandise return charges in cost of sales 
fixed assets and depreciation fixed assets are stated at cost 
major improvements and betterments to existing facilities and equipment are capitalized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the life of the applicable asset are charged to expense as incurred 
buildings are depreciated over a year term 
fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease term 
a majority of the company s operating leases are ten years in term 
amortization of capital lease assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
the company records software developed for internal use in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
accordingly  software developed internally for the use by the company is capitalized only during the application development stage and only certain costs are capitalized 
impairment of long lived assets fixed assets and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally measured based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
goodwill goodwill represents the adjusted amount of the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in purchase transactions  and is being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
the amortization period is determined by taking into consideration the following factors the critical market position and establishment of brand names  the combined store mass of the companies  the amortization periods generally used in the retail music business  the highly competitive nature of the business including emerging forms of competition  and the overall history of profitability of the acquired businesses 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying amount of goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the company performs an analysis of the recoverability of goodwill using a cash flow approach consistent with the analysis of the impairment of long lived assets 
store opening and closing costs costs associated with opening a store are expensed as incurred 
when it is determined that a store will be closed  estimated unrecoverable costs are charged to expense 
such costs include the net book value of abandoned fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and a provision for lease obligations  less estimated sub rental income 
the residual value of any fixed asset moved to a store as part of a relocation is transferred to the relocated store 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and tax loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowances based upon management s estimates of realizability

recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas no 
also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective february  furthermore  any goodwill or intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life and acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas no 
accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company is required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform to the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition apart from goodwill 
under sfas no 
 the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the second quarter of in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
by the end of the first quarter of any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the company will be required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of february  the company will then have up to six months from february  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations

 the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million  which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was million and million for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas nos

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no

the standard also requires the company to record a corresponding asset which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
for the quarter ending may  the company is currently assessing sfas no 
and the impact that adoption will have on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable

if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company is required to adopt sfas no

to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
