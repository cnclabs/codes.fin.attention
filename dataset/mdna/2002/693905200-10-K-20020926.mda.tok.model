item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we record all of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and costs in excess of net assets of acquired businesses commonly known as goodwill  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding future events and circumstances that could affect the value of those assets  such as future economic conditions that will affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable or sell our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates and assumptions are based on current information available to us at the time they are made 
many of those events and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and if changes in those events or circumstances occur thereafter  gaap may require us to adjust the earlier estimates that are affected by those changes 
any downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs in the fair value of any of these assets 
examples include reserves or allowances established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and reserves for inventory obsolescence based on estimates or judgments that we make about the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the market and salability of the products we have in our inventories 
write downs of uncollectible accounts or the value of obsolete or slow moving inventories are charged against those reserves or allowances 
the reserves or allowances are established and replenished following write downs  or increased in response to changed economic conditions or other circumstances  by charges to income 
with respect to other assets  such as goodwill  we write down their fair value directly upon determining that  due to changes in events or circumstances  the amounts at which they are carried on our books exceed their current fair value  by increases in general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
under gaap  many businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also in the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services 
additionally  in the case of a company that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap may require the establishment of reserves or allowances for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and its historical product return experience 
in addition  promotional allowances and discounts that are extended to customers also may be charged against  and therefore can reduce  reported revenues 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of those assets and to establish reserves or allowances that are adequate to absorb potential write downs in the value of accounts receivable and inventories 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer and establish an allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of business we extend day payment terms to our customers 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of and establish an allowance for uncollectible amounts or receivables in each reporting period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and economic conditions that may affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 

table of contents replenishments of or increases in the amount of the allowance  if determined to be warranted by changed conditions or factors  are recorded in the period they become known 
for example  if the financial condition of the company s customers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is replenished or increased by recording a charge against income  any replenishment of or increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when that takes place 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and are reduced by an allowance for excess and slow moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with our product lines  estimates concerning future economic conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by competitors  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
long lived assets 
long lived assets such as goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
currently  estimated undiscounted future cash flows are used to determine if an asset is impaired and  if such a determination were to be made  the carrying value of the asset would be reduced to fair value 
any resulting impairment would be recorded as a charge against income in the period in which the impairment was recorded 
beginning with the fiscal year ending june   however  we will be required to assess our goodwill for impairment based on the new standards established by sfas no 
we will not be able to determine the full effect of these new standards on our financial position or our results of operations until we are able to complete our impairment analysis using the new standards 
under existing accounting standards  our assessment of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed as of june  in the event our analysis under the new standards indicates this goodwill is impaired  we will be required to record a charge  retroactive to july   against our earnings in fiscal  the amount of which is not presently determinable 
impact of recent eitf guidance in accordance with eitf issue no 
eitf accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  the company reclassified freight out expense from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of sales for all periods presented 
this change has no effect on net income loss or earnings loss per share 
the change increased cost of sales and decreased selling  general and administrative expenses during the fiscal years ended june   and by million  million and  respectively 
the results in the accompanying financial statements reflect the application of the consensus reached by the eitf of the fasb in issue eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
the change requires a reclassification of certain marketing and promotional expenses from operating expenses selling expenses to a reduction in sales

prior period financial statements have been reclassified to comply with this eitf guidance 
the change reduced both net sales and selling  general and administrative expenses during the fiscal years ended june   and by million  million and million  respectively 
overview in fiscal  we made a strategic decision to sell our nail care product businesses in order to focus on the more profitable glue  adhesive and sealant business 
in furtherance of that strategy  we sold our california chemical acrylics product line at the end of fiscal and our cook bates nail care product line in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  our sales of nail care products declined by approximately million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal and  primarily for that reason  our total net sales for fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal 
table of contents at the same time we implemented cost cutting and restructuring programs that were designed to align our operating costs to match our reduced level of sales and improve our operating efficiencies 
among other things  we consolidated some of our operations into our primary manufacturing facility in rancho cucamonga  california  which enabled us to reduce the amount of space we had under lease and we also restructured our sales organization and took steps to reduce staffing 
in connection with the program  we incurred restructuring charges of  see results of operations restructuring charges below 
fiscal operating results 
we generated operating income of approximately million in the fiscal year ended june  fiscal operating income was impacted by actions taken to refocus pacer s resources on growing its core adhesive products business 
those actions included the sale of the cook bates product line that generated a pre tax gain included in operating income of million and restructuring charges amounting to  consisting mainly of lease termination charges and employee termination costs 
in addition  operating income was impacted by a provision for bad debts for k mart  a long time major retail customer that filed for chapter bankruptcy protection and the sale of our remaining cook bates return merchandise at bargain prices 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the cook bates product line  which totaled approximately million  together with the proceeds from the collection of pre sale cook bates receivables primarily to reduce our outstanding bank borrowings  and at june  we had no bank borrowings outstanding as compared to million at june  outlook for fiscal we currently expect improved profitability during the fiscal year ending june   due primarily to improvements in raw materials sourcing  new marketing and sales initiatives that are designed to achieve increases in our market share in the consumer adhesive products markets  and new product releases 
however  we expect that our sales in the first two quarters of fiscal  will be lower than in the fiscal comparable quarters  due to the sale of our nail care products business  which accounted for approximately million  or  of our total sales in fiscal and the closure of our united kingdom facility 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data expressed as a percentage of the company s net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses restructuring charges gain loss on sale of product lines other expense  net income loss before taxes net income loss fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales in fiscal declined million to million  a decrease from the prior year 
sales in the united states  which represented of our total sales in fiscal  decreased from million to million 
of that decline  million was primarily attributable to the sale of our nail care product lines 
adhesive sales in the united states declined by million or of net sales  as compared to the prior fiscal year  due to a number of factors including a decision to discontinue sales of products to k mart  that accounted for approximately  of the decrease in us adhesive net sales  consolidation among retailers in the sales channels where we sell our products  increased pricing pressures and new entrants into the marketplace 
international sales  in fiscal  which consisted primarily of adhesive product sales  also contributed to million of the total net sales decline  as such sales decreased to approximately million  in fiscal  as compared to million  in fiscal the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to the closure of our facilities in the united kingdom 

table of contents in fiscal  net sales declined by million to million or from the prior year 
sales in the united states  that represented of total net sales in fiscal  decreased by million or from million to million 
the domestic revenue decline of approximately million was primarily attributable to the slowing of the united states economy in fiscal promotional and advertising expenses decreased by million as a result of the sale of the cook bates product line that impacted net sales 
international sales increased in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  totaling million  or of total net sales for fiscal year  as compared to million and of total net sales in fiscal gross profit 
our gross margin gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to improved raw material sourcing  the closure of our united kingdom facility  a reduction of approximately  in distribution related costs and a favorable shift in product mix associated with the disposition of our nail care product lines 
our gross margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to  of charges in the quarter ended june  resulting from the closure of our united kingdom facility 
excluding those charges  our gross margin would have remained relatively unchanged at approximately 
we currently anticipate further improvements in our gross margin during the fiscal year ending june   as we expect to realize additional benefits from improvements in raw materials sourcing and our business will no longer be impacted by write offs associated with the cook bates product line 
selling  general administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  decreased by million from million or of net sales in fiscal to million or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily the result of workforce reductions that we were able to make as the result of the sale of the cook bates product line 
the increase in sg a  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  is mainly attributable to bad debt expense associated with k mart s  filing  in january  for chapter bankruptcy protection and the fact that net sales declined at a greater rate than did sg a expenses 
in fiscal  sg a decreased by  and as a percent of net sales  declined to compared to in fiscal this decline in fiscal was primarily the result of higher than normal expenses in fiscal that amounted to  associated with a costs incurred to defend a proxy contest waged by a group of dissident shareholders at the annual meeting held in november restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program to bring our operating costs in line with our operations following the sale of our nail care product lines 
that program included the consolidation of operations  formerly conducted at multiple facilities  into our primary manufacturing facility in rancho cucamonga  california and work force reductions 
as a result  restructuring charges totaled  and were mainly lease termination charges and employee termination charges  which represented of our net sales in fiscal there were no restructuring charges in fiscal gain loss on sale of product lines 
we sold inventory and certain fixed and intangible assets related to the cook bates product line which consisted largely of personal care manicure implements  seasonal gift sets and halloween merchandise for million cash 
that inventory totaled million and the net book value of the remaining assets sold in that transaction totaled  in connection with the sale  we recorded transaction related costs of  a  loss associated with the sale of holiday merchandise at bargain prices and a gain of million or of net sales  which are included in operating income in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended june  in fiscal year  we sold all of the assets  properties and goodwill of the california chemical product line  which consisted primarily of bulk liquids and powders for the sculptured acrylic finger nail processes to esschem  inc in exchange for  cash plus the transfer by esschem to pacer of  shares of pacer common stock owned by esschem 
as a result of this transaction  we wrote off the remaining goodwill that arose from the acquisition in the goodwill impairment  a one time  non cash charge  of million or of net sales is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents other expense  net 
other expense  net  which consists primarily of interest charges on outstanding bank borrowings  was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal interest expense decreased by  during fiscal as a result of reductions in outstanding debt made possible by the cook bates sale and  to a lesser extent  declines in prevailing rates of interest 
other expense  net  in fiscal  which also consisted primarily of interest charges on outstanding bank borrowings  was  as compared to  in fiscal that decline was due to declining rates of interest in fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by all activities in fiscal was  versus net cash provided of  in the prior year 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year this increase was due primarily to the receipt of the cash proceeds from the sale of the cook bates product line in september and a million reduction in accounts receivable due  in large part  to the collection of accounts receivable from sales of our cook bates products prior to the sale of the cook bates product line and the sale of our remaining inventories of cook bates products 
we used cash of  in investing activities to fund capital expenditures in fiscal in fiscal  the  in cash proceeds from the california chemical sale more that offset capital expenditures and  as a result  investing activities provided cash of  in fiscal we used the cash provided by operations in fiscal  principally generated by the cook bates sale  to reduce net borrowings under our bank credit facilities by million and to repurchase common shares in our open market and private stock repurchase program 
as a result  cash used in financing activities in fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we funded our working capital requirements primarily with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings under a revolving bank credit line pursuant to which we may borrow up to the lesser of i million or ii the sum of of the face dollar amount of eligible accounts receivable plus of the cost of our finished goods inventories and approximately of raw material inventories the borrowing base 
borrowings under the credit facility are payable in monthly interest only installments until the maturity date of the credit line  which is october  during fiscal our credit line borrowings bore interest at the bank s prime rate at june   less  or at the bank s libor base rate  plus 
effective june   the rate for libor borrowings will be reduced to the bank s libor base rate  pursuant to the terms of our bank credit line agreement  because we generated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of more than million for the six months ended june  this new libor borrowing rate will continue in effect provided that we are able to achieve ebitda of at least  in each subsequent fiscal quarter 
at june   we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving bank credit line and approximately million of unused borrowings were available based on eligible collateral 
by comparison  at june   outstanding credit line borrowings totaled million 
we also have a bank credit facility under which we may obtain commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit  and banker s acceptances in amounts not exceeding million in the aggregate 
any amount outstanding on this additional credit facility will reduce the borrowing base on the revolving bank credit line 
this credit facility expires on october  as of june   there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
from december to july  we made million of repurchases of our common stock pursuant to an open market and private common stock repurchase plan 
on march   the amount we could use to repurchase common stock was increased to  per year  subject to certain bank covenants 
the amount of repurchases was also limited by certain securities and exchange commission volume and price restrictions 
pursuant to that plan we used borrowings and internally generated funds totaling  to repurchase  of our shares in fiscal 
table of contents and bank borrowings of  to repurchase  of our shares in fiscal in august  we completed and terminated the stock repurchase program 
we do not currently anticipate making additional share repurchases during the fiscal year ending june  we believe that availability under the credit line  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital and other cash requirements over the next twelve months 
however  we may take advantage of opportunities to acquire other adhesive products businesses  should they arise  or to invest in new product introductions  in which case we may incur borrowings to do so 
at the present time  we are introducing our new anchor tite tm and go spot go products 
seasonality and quarterly financial data historically  we have sold a greater volume of nail care products in the third calendar quarter of the year our first fiscal quarter  than in other quarters  because merchants tend to begin stocking such products during the fall in anticipation of increases in holiday sales during the last calendar quarter of the year 
as a result of the sale of the cook bates product line  we expect that we will cease to encounter such sizable quarterly variations in our sales and operating results
