item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity capital resources during fiscal year  universal continued to closely monitor credit markets and access additional sources of liquidity where it proved advantageous 
during fiscal year  in reaction to the tightening bank credit markets  the company expanded its sources of liquidity through the establishment of a million medium term note program 
through fiscal year and  the company has issued about million in medium term notes with maturity dates from to the issuance changed the company s financial structure and increased the average life of its debt because the proceeds were used primarily to retire maturing long term debt and to refund notes payable  both of which were classified as current liabilities 
universal s total debt decreased by about million during the year  and its total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including deferred taxes and minority interest fell to about 
working capital fell by about million to million  and the current ratio decreased from to  primarily because of a million increase in the current portion of long term obligations related to debt maturing in february the company expects to finance that maturing debt using amounts remaining in its medium term note program and operating cash flow 
total long term obligations  including current maturities  increased by million to million while notes payable decreased by million to million 
the increase in long term obligations was primarily related to the company s financing of its investment in its us facilities 
the company has interest rate swaps that effectively convert million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the purpose of these interest rate swaps is to better match its effective interest rate to the market rates of interest that customers pay the company for inventory purchased for their accounts 
during the fiscal year  the company terminated swaps on million of fixed debt for an aggregate gain of million  which is being amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged liability 
the amortization benefit in fiscal year was immaterial 
as of june   universal and its affiliates had approximately million in uncommitted lines of credit  of which approximately million were unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs 
effective april   the company replaced its million revolving credit facilities with two equal facilities  totaling million 
as of june  the company had no amounts outstanding under either credit facility 
universal s commercial paper program  which provides flexibility in the company s short term borrowings  is supported by these new back up facilities 
under the terms of its bank agreements  the company must maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and working capital and observe restrictions on debt levels 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at june   and the facilities exceeded the total amount that would have been needed if it had been necessary to retire all short term borrowing and the current portion of long term debt at that date 
management believes that the company has adequate resources available to meet its needs  which are predominantly short term in nature and relate to working capital required for financing tobacco crop purchases 
working capital needs are seasonal within each geographical region 
the geographical dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit universal to predict its general level of cash requirements 
each geographic area follows the cycle of buying  processing  and shipping of the tobacco crop 
the timing of individual customer shipping requirements may change the level or the duration of crop financing 
the working capital needs of agri products operations fluctuate during the year  depending on the product  the country of origin  and the company s inventory position  however  the total working capital requirements of agri products remain relatively stable due to offsetting seasonal patterns 
working capital needs of lumber and building products operations in europe follow a pattern similar to that of the construction industry  where the third quarter of the fiscal year is typically sluggish due to winter weather and the holiday season 
the company finances its seasonal working capital needs with short term lines of credit  customer advances  and trade payables 
the company estimates that its inventories of flue cured and burley tobaccos that were not committed to customers as of june   were approximately million kilograms  strip weight  which is about below those of last year 
management does not consider these levels to be excessive 
the company s capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value to the customer  replace obsolete equipment  increase efficiency  or position it for future growth 
universal s capital expenditures were approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in capital expenditures from to was caused by a major investment in leaf processing in the united states that was announced on may  since then  the company has upgraded the facility in danville  virginia  which is in start up mode 
in addition  it has made significant progress on the new facility in nash county  north carolina  which is scheduled to open in the summer of the cost of the two projects is estimated to be over million 
at june   the company had approximately million in outstanding commitments related to these projects 
the company has elected to partially fund the projects using a secured  multi draw million term loan facility  which its subsidiary obtained on december  the facility is guaranteed by the company and is secured by certain assets of the projects 
the loan matures on december   and under some conditions  the subsidiary can exercise an extension option for an additional four years 
as of june   approximately million had been drawn under the facility and about million had been spent on the projects 
see properties 
in may  universal s board of directors approved a share purchase program that has since been expanded to permit the purchase of up to million of the common stock of the company 
the purchases are carried out from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not exceeding prevailing market prices 
the purchases have been  and are expected to be  funded primarily from operating cash flow of the company 
at june   universal had approximately million common shares outstanding and had purchased approximately million shares of its common stock for about million pursuant to the program 
funds supporting the company s erisa regulated defined benefit pension plans were reduced by negative market activity during fiscal year and again during the following month 
as of august   the market value of the funds was about million  which is somewhat below the accumulated benefit obligation of million and below the projected benefit obligation of million based on certain assumptions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these obligations were measured as of march  the company will contribute approximately million to the pension fund during the next year  which is more than the contribution required by erisa 
it is the company s policy to monitor the market performance of the funds and to review the adequacy of its funding and its contributions to those funds 
the fund is managed for long term returns  and the company has not changed its investment allocation in response to recent market returns 
management believes that its financial resources are adequate to support its capital needs 
those resources include cash from operations  cash balances  its remaining medium term note program  the amounts remaining on its multi draw secured facility  and committed and uncommitted bank lines 
any excess cash flow from operations after dividends  capital expenditures  and long term debt payments will be available to reduce short term debt  fund expansion  purchase the company s stock  or otherwise enhance shareholder value 
results of operations fiscal year compared to sales and other operating revenues for fiscal year decreased million or to billion compared to last year 
the majority of the decline was in the tobacco segment  where revenue fell by million 
although smaller crops in a number of key exporting areas reduced volumes  the primary factor in the revenue reduction for fiscal year was the change in manufacturers purchasing methods in the united states 
in that year  a number of us manufacturers bought tobacco directly from farmers through contracts and paid leaf merchants to process it 
prior to that year  leaf dealers also purchased tobacco for most us manufacturers 
for the years ended june    and  revenue from subsidiaries and affiliates of philip morris companies inc was million  million and billion  respectively 
beginning with the us burley crop in fiscal year  followed by both the us flue cured and burley crops in fiscal year  philip morris began to purchase directly from growers under contract arrangements 
although this change was the primary cause of the decline in revenue  it did not have a commensurate effect on segment operating income because the company continued to process its normal share of the crops 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues of the agri products segment were down by million due to lower tea prices and sharply lower synthetic rubber sales in europe 
lumber and building products revenue increased by million due to higher sales of garden timbers and garden houses by an acquired company 
segment operating income as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was million in compared to in  a decrease of million 
tobacco operating profits in fiscal year were million  a decline of million compared to fiscal year tobacco operating profits declined due to smaller crops in several origins  including zimbabwe  malawi  and poland 
us operations experienced higher costs from staffing both contract receiving stations and the auction system  as well as a decline in green market service income compared to last year 
the company no longer receives purchasing fees on us volumes for which it only provides processing services 
in addition  overall margins on sales of brazilian tobacco were lower due to the mix of business there 
during fiscal year  the company recognized million in expenses related to the argentine currency devaluation and the company accelerated the planned closure of its henderson  north carolina facility in fiscal year as a result of the closure and after us consolidation measures  the company recognized million in costs in that period 
increased earnings from higher volumes shipped from argentina  asia  western europe  and the company s oriental tobacco joint venture were not sufficient to overcome these factors for the year 
results for the company s lumber and building operations were down for the fiscal year  reflecting  in part  the impact of the strong us dollar during the period 
agri products earnings declined for the year  as stronger results in the company s dried fruit and nut business were not sufficient to overcome the impact of difficult market conditions in rubber  sunflower seeds  and tea 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased million due to higher lumber and building product selling costs and higher pension expense 
interest expense decreased by million due to lower interest rates in fiscal year compared to the company s consolidated income tax rate declined from the prior year rate to approximately due to the mix of foreign and domestic earnings 
fiscal year compared to sales and other operating revenues for fiscal year declined million or to billion compared to fiscal year revenue decreased in all three operating segments in fiscal year  with the most significant decline in the tobacco segment  which experienced a decrease of million 
the reduced level of tobacco sales in fiscal year was due to the effect of smaller us crops and the change in the us market structure 
manufacturers purchased a significant portion of the us burley crop in fiscal year directly from growers under contract arrangements rather than through leaf merchants like universal 
see business description of tobacco business general 
agri products revenues in fiscal year were down million or primarily due to lower prices for nuts and on reduced sales of canned meats following unusually strong sales in fiscal year lumber and building products revenues in fiscal year were adversely affected by the strength of the us dollar  which appreciated  on average  approximately against the dutch guilder in segment operating income as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
tobacco operating profits in fiscal year were million an increase of million from fiscal year the favorable impact of increased volumes in fiscal year from the larger crops in africa was offset by the effect of smaller crops in the united states  brazil  poland  and hungary 
the volume of tobacco that universal processed in the united states declined in fiscal year as a result of a reduction in us flue cured and burley crops 
although the change to manufacturer s direct purchasing of burley tobacco in the us market caused a significant decline in revenues in fiscal year  it did not have a commensurate effect on operating income because the company continued to process its normal share of the crop 
shipment timing made comparisons for the oriental tobacco joint venture more difficult in fiscal year as old crop shipments benefited results for fiscal year market conditions improved during fiscal year in most areas  although a world oversupply of filler grades of dark air cured tobacco had a negative effect on the company s results 
due to a decline in the dutch guilder during  lumber and building products results declined by  even as results improved in the local currency 
although tea markets showed improvement during fiscal year  results for the agri products business lagged fiscal year s performance by because of continued competitive pressure in sunflower seeds and adverse conditions in the rubber markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year declined by million due to lower tobacco selling costs and the effect of the strong us dollar on translation of such costs in the lumber and building products segment 
corporate expenses  however  increased during fiscal year primarily due to increased debt issuance costs 
in june  the company adopted restructuring plans for its us and polish tobacco operations 
in the united states  direct contracting with farmers initiated by major domestic manufacturers caused the company to restructure its leaf purchasing operations  necessitating a reduction in personnel 
the restructuring charge in fiscal year included approximately million of severance costs related to employees 
in poland  due to declining domestic tobacco production  the company closed one of its two processing plants  resulting in a million restructuring charge in fiscal year this restructuring charge included approximately million of severance costs for employees and a charge of million for fixed asset impairment 
the severance costs will be funded from cash provided by operations 
the majority of the severance payments were made in fiscal year interest expense for fiscal year increased by million due to higher borrowing rates associated with the replacement of short term debt with long term issues 
the company s consolidated income tax rate declined slightly in fiscal year from the prior year rate due to the mix of foreign and domestic earnings 
the rate was affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to the mix of domestic and foreign earnings  subsidiary local tax rates  the repatriation of foreign earnings  and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to generally accepted accounting principles  and are consistently applied 
however  changes in the assumptions used could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas inventories inventories of tobacco and agri products are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific cost method 
lumber and building products inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
the company writes down inventory for changes in market value based upon assumptions related to future demand and market conditions 
future demand assumptions can be impacted by changes in customer sales  changes in customers inventory positions and policies  competitors pricing policies and inventory positions  changing customer needs  and varying crop sizes and qualities 
market conditions that differ significantly from those assumed by management could result in additional write downs 
the company experiences inventory write downs routinely 
inventory write downs in and were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or as necessary utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
the preparation of discounted future operating cash flow analyses requires significant management judgment with respect to operating earnings growth rates  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the majority of the goodwill is from acquisitions in the tobacco segment 
neither a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption or a one percentage point decline in the cash flow growth rate assumption would result in an impairment charge 
however  other more significant changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
the company is subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in changes to the estimated taxes 
in addition  the company makes assumptions regarding the future utilization of foreign tax credits  alternative minimum tax credits and tax loss carryforwards 
these assumptions could be affected by changes in future taxable income and its sources and changes in us or foreign tax laws 
the effective tax rate for the company could be impacted by changes in these assumptions 
after the filing of the fiscal year tax return  the company has approximately million in foreign tax credit carryforwards that will expire  unless they are used  by fiscal year any significant reduction in future taxable income and its sources or changes in us or foreign tax laws could result in the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
for additional disclosures on income taxes see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension plans and postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plans costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  mortality rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension reporting are reviewed annually with outside consultants and compared with external benchmarks to determine whether the company s accounting for future pension obligations is reasonable 
a one percentage point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase the pension expense for by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would increase the accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit expense for the fiscal year by approximately thousand 
see note notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions 
other information regarding trends and management s actions world markets for flue cured and burley tobaccos are currently approximately in balance and are expected to remain so through as overall availability should meet demand  however  worldwide inventories of oriental tobaccos are high and are expected to remain in excess through next year 
management expects world flue cured production to increase further in calendar year as larger crops in brazil and forecasts in other countries are expected to offset a decline in the zimbabwe flue cured crop 
in  management believes flue cured production should be similar to that in because further expected reductions in zimbabwe and india are forecasted to offset expected increases in brazil and other african origins 
burley production is expected to increase over the next two years with crop sizes moving up in malawi in and in mexico and in brazil in generally  production changes in and will impact the company s fiscal years and  respectively 
demand for leaf and manufactured tobacco products has increased during each of the last two years at an estimated compound annual rate of 
the increases are due in part to improving economic conditions in asia and the former soviet union 
the increase in leaf demand and smaller crops have helped reduce surplus leaf stocks 
the company expects that demand for leaf and tobacco products will be flat or declining slightly for the near term due to improved leaf utilization by cigarette manufacturers 
on a year to year basis  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in leaf supply due to crop size and to leaf demand as manufacturers adjust inventories or respond to changes in the cigarette market 
in december  the us commodity credit corporation ccc purchased from the stabilization cooperatives about million kilos of surplus flue cured and burley inventories 
the us department of agriculture has decided to destroy this tobacco 
by law  this tobacco may not be sold for domestic use in the united states  and subsidized sales into international markets are not permitted under provisions of the world trade organization 
uncommitted worldwide flue cured and burley inventories totaled million kilos  excluding the ccc inventories and those of asian government owned monopolies 
that amount  which had been trending upward since mid  has declined in each of the last two years 
excluding the ccc inventories  the drop was million kilos or of the inventory level at june  the us stabilization cooperatives currently hold about million kilos 
although cigar consumption  especially those that are mass produced  is still growing in the united states and europe  the rate of growth continues to be down significantly from levels experienced in the boom years 
supplies of filler and binder styles of dark air cured tobaccos have been in surplus as manufacturers reduce their inventories to levels consistent with the current level of sales growth  while wrapper demand continues firm 
within the smokeless segment of the dark tobacco business  consumption of loose leaf chewing tobacco has been declining between two and three percent annually  while the consumption of snuff products have been growing approximately three percent annually 
management believes that there is an adequate supply of suitable dark tobacco in the world market to meet the demand of the manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products 
the company has a significant presence in the united states  where the level of tobacco production is uncertain 
for a number of years  us leaf has not been price competitive in world markets due primarily to the federal price support program and the improvement in tobacco quality in foreign areas  particularly brazil 
the high price of us leaf relative to the world market led to reduced exports which  combined with declining purchases by us manufacturers  has reduced the amount of us tobacco that can be produced and sold in the united states 
domestic leaf purchases are unlikely to increase because of the continued decline of cigarette consumption in the united states 
exports of us leaf are likely to continue to decline unless the competitive position of us leaf improves dramatically 
without such an improvement  foreign manufacturers are likely to continue to shift their purchases to other tobacco producing areas  such as brazil and africa where the company has significant operations 
the company has responded to the decrease in demand for  and production of  us tobacco and the change in the us marketing system by closing certain plants  restructuring operations  and reducing personnel 
since fiscal year  the company has closed three large  high volume tobacco processing plants 
in addition  the company will decommission another plant at the end of fiscal year  that will be replaced with a new facility in nash county  north carolina 
the rationalization from five processing plants in fiscal year to two plants for fiscal year is forecast to result in a reduction of  processing employees between those periods 
the company has offered in its first quarter of fiscal year a voluntary early retirement program for certain us employees 
the projected cost of this program is million and will be recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year in the united states  the method of purchasing flue cured and burley tobacco has changed recently 
these tobaccos used to be purchased almost exclusively at public auctions  and now the majority of these tobaccos are purchased from farmers under contracts 
in the auction system  purchasers bought individual piles of tobacco and were generally able to purchase only those piles that conformed to their respective quality and grade desires 
in the current us contract system  most contracts  including the company s  require that each farmer sell his entire crop of tobacco 
thus the shift to contract purchasing has changed the risk characteristics of the us flue cured and burley tobacco markets by increasing the possibility that purchasers such as the company could acquire grades or styles of tobacco for which it does not have orders 
while this risk exists in all markets in which the company purchases tobacco through farmer contracts  the high price of us tobacco exacerbates the problem 
management believes that it will be able to manage the risk 
the company expects market conditions to remain challenging in the year ahead 
management continues to closely monitor the situation in zimbabwe where the political and economic environment remains extremely difficult 
the size of the flue cured crop now being marketed is expected to be below that of last year 
while this reduction will undoubtedly exacerbate the economic difficulties in zimbabwe  the volume declines are expected to be offset by production increases in other african origins and brazil 
early indications are that the zimbabwe crop to be marketed in fiscal year could be substantially smaller than the crop currently being marketed 
that crop has not yet been planted 
because the company expects that most of the shortfall in zimbabwe tobacco will be replaced with crops from areas in which the company contracts with and provides financing to farmers  the company could face increased financing and inventory risk since zimbabwe tobacco is purchased at auction 
the situation in argentina remains unsettled 
although the devaluation of the peso has improved the competitive market position of argentine leaf  it is uncertain at this time whether future currency movements will further impact the value of the company s argentine assets 
an important trend in the tobacco industry has been consolidation among manufacturers and among leaf tobacco merchants 
this trend is expected to continue  particularly as further privatization of state monopolies occurs  providing opportunities for acquisitions by international manufacturers 
this concentration should intensify the competition for market share within the leaf tobacco industry 
a key success factor for leaf dealers in the future will be to provide customers with the quality of leaf and the level of service they desire at the lowest cost possible 
in addition  the leaf dealers to some extent have larger historical market shares with some customers than others 
consequently  the company s potential growth will be affected by the growth of its major customers  and consolidations of customers may have at least a short term favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s business 
universal s consolidated income tax rate for the current year is 
the tax rate is affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and investments  subsidiary tax rates  repatriation of foreign earnings and the ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
in recent years  the company s domestic income has been declining while foreign income has been increasing 
if this trend continues and tax rates remain constant worldwide  the company could be less able to utilize its foreign tax credits and the company s consolidated income tax rate would increase 
although the recent weakening of the us dollar in relation to the euro should benefit earnings of the lumber and building products sector in fiscal year  there are now clear signs that activity in the dutch construction industry is slowing due to a stagnating economy  which is beginning to negatively affect sales volumes and margins 
factors that may affect future results the foregoing discussion contains certain forward looking statements  which may be identified by phrases such as the company expects or management believes or words of similar effect 
in addition  the company may publish  from time to time  forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and similar matters 
the following important factors  among other things  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for a fiscal year and any interim period to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company assumes no duty to update any of the statements in this report 
tobacco business operating factors universal s financial results are affected by a number of factors that directly or indirectly impact the company s tobacco operations 
operating factors that may affect the company s results of operations include competition  reliance on significant customers the leaf tobacco industry is highly competitive 
competition among leaf tobacco merchants is based on the firm s ability to meet customer specifications in the buying  processing  and financing of tobacco as well as the price charged for products and services 
in addition  there is competition in all countries to buy the available tobacco 
there are three major independent global competitors in the leaf tobacco industry  and they are dependent upon a few large customers 
the number of manufacturers has declined in recent years due to consolidation 
the loss of  or a substantial reduction in the services provided to  any large or significant customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
market balance universal s financial results can be significantly affected by changes in the overall balance of worldwide supply and demand for leaf tobacco 
customers purchase tobacco based upon their expectations of future requirements  and those expectations can change from time to time depending upon internal and external factors affecting their business 
trends in the global consumption of cigarettes  such as the growth in popularity of american blend cigarettes  as well as trends in sales of cigars and other tobacco products  influence manufacturers expectations and thus their demand for leaf tobacco 
the total supply of tobacco at any given time is a function of current tobacco production and the volumes of uncommitted stocks of processed tobacco from prior years production 
production of tobacco in a given year may be significantly affected by the amount of tobacco planted by farmers throughout the world  fluctuations in the weather in geographically dispersed regions  and crop disease 
any material imbalance in the supply and demand for tobacco could impact the company s results of operations 
the company s purchases of tobacco are often made in local currency and therefore changes in local currency can make a particular crop more or less attractive in the world market 
methods of purchasing tobacco the company purchases leaf tobacco from farmers  growers and other suppliers through public auction and privately negotiated contract purchases 
in a number of countries  including argentina  brazil  guatemala  hungary  italy  mozambique  mexico  tanzania  the united states  and zambia  where the company contracts directly with tobacco farmers  the company takes the risk that the tobacco delivered will meet quality and quantity requirements 
if the tobacco does not meet such market requirements  the company may not be able to sell it at an attractive price or meet all of its customers orders 
in addition the company provides financing to growers in many foreign countries 
unless it receives marketable tobacco  the company may not be able to fully recover its crop advances 
company affiliates also have dark tobacco growing operations in indonesia and brazil where they have similar risks 
weather and conditions of crop tobacco is an agricultural product that is subject to vagaries of weather and environment that can  in some cases  change the quality or size of a tobacco crop in a particular area 
if a weather event is particularly wide spread  such as a severe drought or a major hurricane  the affected crop could be destroyed or damaged to an extent that it would be less desirable for manufacturers 
in addition  other items can affect the marketability of tobacco  including the presence of foreign matter  genetically modified organisms  and excess pesticide or fertilizer residue 
a significant event impacting the condition or quality of a large amount of tobacco could make it difficult for the company to sell such tobacco or to fill its customers orders 
timing of customer shipments the company recognizes sales and revenue from tobacco operations at the time that title to the tobacco and risk of loss passes to the customer 
individual shipments may be large  and since the customer typically specifies shipping dates  the company s comparative financial results may vary significantly between reporting periods 
governmental factors the tobacco business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local governments in the united states and by foreign governments in many jurisdictions where the company operates 
governmental factors that may affect the company s results of operations include government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption the us federal and certain state and local governments have taken or proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing us consumption of tobacco products 
these activities have included the us environmental protection agency s decision to classify environmental tobacco smoke as a group a known human carcinogen  which action has been ruled unlawful by a federal district court decision that has been appealed  restrictions on the use of tobacco products in public places and places of employment including a proposal by the us occupational safety and health administration to severely restrict smoking in the work place  proposals by the us food and drug administration fda to regulate nicotine as a drug and sharply restrict cigarette advertising and promotion  determined by the us supreme court to be outside the jurisdiction of the fda  proposals to increase the federal and state excise taxes on cigarettes  and the policy of the us government to link certain federal grants to the enforcement of state laws restricting the sale of tobacco products 
numerous other legislative and regulatory anti smoking measures have also been proposed at the federal  state and local levels 
excluding the effect of tobacco contained in cigarettes imported to the united states  universal estimates that between and of the flue cured and burley tobaccos that it handles worldwide are ultimately consumed in the united states 
in addition  a number of foreign governments have also taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
in some cases  such restrictions are more onerous than those proposed or in effect in the united states 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect its business 
a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
political uncertainties in foreign tobacco operations the company s international operations are subject to uncertainties and risks relating to the political stability of certain foreign governments  principally in developing countries and emerging markets  and to the effects of changes in the trade policies and economic regulations of foreign governments 
these uncertainties and risks include the effects of war  insurrection  expropriation or nationalization of assets  undeveloped or antiquated commercial laws  subsidies for local tobacco growers and companies  issuance of licenses to conduct business in foreign jurisdictions  import and export restrictions  the imposition of excise and other taxes on tobacco  monetary and exchange controls  inflationary economies  and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
in the past  the company has experienced significant year to year fluctuations in earnings due to changes in the brazilian government s economic policies 
the company has substantial capital investments in south america and africa and the performance of its operations in these regions can materially affect the company s earnings from tobacco operations 
for example  the company has significant operations and assets in zimbabwe  which is currently experiencing political and economic unrest 
if the political situation in zimbabwe were to deteriorate significantly  the company s ability to recover its assets there could be impaired 
the company s equity in its net assets of subsidiaries in zimbabwe was million at june  to the extent that the company could not replace any lost volumes of tobacco with tobacco from other sources  the company s results of operations would suffer 
united states trade policies the us tobacco price support system is an industry funded federal program that is administered by the us department of agriculture 
the effect of the price support system has been to increase the cost of domestic tobacco relative to most foreign tobacco  resulting in a decline in exports of us tobacco 
in  congress repealed certain domestic content legislation that had required that all domestically manufactured cigarettes contain at least domestically grown tobacco and replaced it with a less restrictive tariff rate import quota system  which was also designed to assist domestic tobacco growers by limiting imports 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which future trade policies or related government activities might affect the company s business 
tax matters the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and from time to time contests assessments of taxes due 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
the consolidated income tax rate is affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and investments  subsidiary local tax rates  repatriation of foreign earnings and the ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
health issues  public sentiment  industry litigation reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and  together with decreased social acceptance of smoking and increased pressure from anti smoking groups  have had an ongoing adverse effect on sales of tobacco products  particularly in the united states 
a significant decrease in global sales of tobacco products brought about by health concerns  decreased social acceptance  or other factors would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
during the past few years  the major us tobacco product manufacturers entered into agreements with states and various us jurisdictions settling asserted and unasserted healthcare cost recovery and other claims 
the settlements provide for billions of dollars in annual payments from those manufacturers and place numerous restrictions on their conduct of business  including restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes  which have reduced tobacco consumption and  therefore  demand for the company s products and services in the united states 
significant decreases in consumption of tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in september  the us government filed a lawsuit against tobacco product manufacturers to recover healthcare costs  similar to the suits settled by the states 
the trial court has dismissed the claims of the federal government under the medical recovery act and the medicare secondary payer provisions of the social security act but has permitted discovery to proceed on the government s claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
trial of the case is currently scheduled for july numerous other healthcare cost recovery suits have been brought against us tobacco product manufacturers in the united states and other countries 
in addition  there are many smoking and health cases filed by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of putative classes pending in the united states and other countries against tobacco product manufacturers 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation 
however  judgments or settlements in these cases could have a detrimental effect on the consumption of tobacco products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
financial factors financial factors that may affect the company s results of operations include extensions of credit although the company s credit experience has been excellent and extensions of credit to customers are evaluated carefully  a significant delay in payment or a significant bad debt provision related to amounts due the company could adversely affect its results 
in addition  crop advances to farmers are generally secured by the farmer s agreement to deliver green tobacco  in the event of crop failure  recovery of advances could be delayed until deliveries of future crops 
funds held by subsidiaries are generally invested in local banks or loaned to other subsidiaries 
to reduce credit risk  investment limits are established with each bank according to the company s evaluation of credit standing 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs and overhead in the source country 
because there is no forward foreign exchange market in many of the company s major countries of tobacco origin  the company manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing its net investment in these countries 
interest rates interest rate risk in the company s tobacco operations is limited because customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased on their order 
however  since interest expense is recorded as a period cost  the company may experience earnings fluctuations on a short term basis if customers delay shipments of tobacco 
non tobacco business the company s agri products and lumber and building products businesses  which are based primarily in the united states and the netherlands  do business in a number of foreign countries 
these operations enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the effect of currency changes on firm purchase and sales commitments in foreign currencies principally euros  us dollars  swedish kronas  and pound sterling 
the terms of currency contracts are generally from one to six months 
this activity is not material 
the company s lumber and building products operations are based in the netherlands  and their reported earnings are affected by the translation of the euro into the us dollar 
this business is seasonal to the extent that winter weather may temporarily interrupt the operations of its customers in the building industry 
the business is also subject to other normal market and operational risks associated with lumber operations centered in europe  including economic conditions in the countries where the company is located  the prices of lumber products  and related trends in the building and construction industry 
the agri products business is affected by operating and other factors that are similar to those that affect the company s tobacco operations  including crop risks  market balance  and governmental factors such as political uncertainties in countries of crop origin
