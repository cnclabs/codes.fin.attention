cymer assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements contained in this report 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of cymer should be read in conjunction with cymer s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in cymer s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues product sales other total revenues cost and expenses cost of product sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and intangible assets purchased in process research and development total costs and expenses operating income other expense net income before income tax provision and minority interest income tax provision minority interest income before extraordinary item and cumulative change in accounting principle extraordinary gain on debt extinguishment cumulative change in accounting principle net income gross margin on product sales years ended december  and revenues 
cymer s revenues consist of product sales  which include sales of laser systems  consumable and spare parts  upgrades  service  training  and software 
other revenues include revenue from funded development activities performed for customers and government contracts 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment  unless customer agreements contain inspection  acceptance or other conditions  in which case revenue is recognized at the time such conditions are satisfied 
funded development contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs  after giving effect to estimates of costs to complete the development project 
product sales decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to decreased sales of duv photolithography laser systems  consumable and spare parts  and services 
this decrease in sales from year to year was due to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry which caused both a lower demand for laser systems and a decreased demand for consumable spare parts as a result of lower utilization of cymer s installed base of lasers 
a total of systems were sold in at an asp of  as compared to systems sold in at an asp of  the higher asp in helped to offset the lower quantity of lasers sold during the year and was the result of cymer s continued introduction of new model lasers which command higher prices 
revenues from funded development projects increased from million in to million in this increase from period to period was primarily due to additional government contract revenues generated through the acquisition of acx  now known as the cymer cambridge division  during the first quarter of during  the majority of revenues generated by the cymer cambridge division were from funded development contracts and accounted for million of the total million funded development projects revenue for the year ended december  cymer s sales are generated primarily by shipments to customers in japan  the netherlands  and the united states 
approximately and of cymer s sales in and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the united states 
cymer maintains a wholly owned japanese subsidiary which sells to cymer s japanese customers 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by this subsidiary  accounted for and of revenues in and  respectively 
the activities of cymer s japanese subsidiary are limited to sales and service of products purchased by the subsidiary from the parent corporation 
all costs of development and production of cymer s products  including costs of shipment to japan  are recorded on the books of the parent company 
cymer anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  and manufacturing and service overhead 
prior to  cymer accounted for foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts associated with purchases of cymer s products by its japanese subsidiary for resale under firm third party sales commitments within cost of product sales 
under sfas for those derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  deferral of the gains or losses is not allowed and the gains and losses are recorded in other income expense 
cymer adopted sfas on january   but did not qualify for hedge accounting until july  accordingly  for contracts entered into prior to july   cymer is required to record changes in the fair value of its foreign currency forward exchange contracts directly through earnings in other income expense in the period such changes occur 
for contracts entered into on or after july   cymer defers effective changes in the fair value of its foreign currency forward exchange contracts into other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassifies the effective changes to cost of product sales in the same period that the related sale is made to the third party 
cost of product sales decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the decrease in sales of product from period to period 
the gross margin on these sales decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower product sales absorbing both higher fixed manufacturing costs and worldwide field support infrastructure costs offset by continued operational efficiencies 
for the year ended december   net gains or losses from foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income as the related sales to the third party were recognized 
for the year ended december   only those contracts meeting the transition period requirements or qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under sfas were included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income 
cymer recognized net gains in cost of sales on such contracts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of internally funded and externally funded projects as well as continuing research support expenses which primarily include employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased development efforts associated with arf laser development which includes cymer s nanolith laser and development efforts associated with f and euv technology 
research and development expenses associated with the nanolith laser increased during the second half of as it moved into the production phase and initial units were shipped to customers during the third quarter of research and development expenses were also higher during due to continued investment in next generation product development to keep pace with technological change in industry requirements as well as the additional research and development expenses associated with the cymer cambridge division and its acx technology 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to due to both decreased revenues and increased spending from period to period 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include the expenses of the sales  marketing and customer support staffs and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to increased operational efficiencies as well as heightened cost controls as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry during as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to due to decreased revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services and administrative operating costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this was due primarily to ongoing improvements in operational efficiencies and increased cost controls for the period due to industry conditions 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to due to decreased revenues 
purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the acquisition of a company and its in process research and development projects 
there were no such expenses incurred during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  these expenses for the year ended december  are due to the acquisition of acx and represent the fair value of acx development projects associated with the application of its technology to the semiconductor market 
as of the date of the acx acquisition  this purchased in process research and development was expensed because the application of this technology to the semiconductor market was at a stage of development that required further research and development before reaching technological feasibility and commercial viability 
other income expense net 
net other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar and gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
net other expense totaled million in as compared to million in the increase in net other expense from period to period is primarily due to lower cash and investment balances as well as lower yields on those investments 
this was offset by gains associated with the change in value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts for cymer s contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per sfas in foreign currency exchange losses totaled million  interest income totaled million  interest expense totaled million  compared to an exchange gain of million  interest income of million  interest expense of million in cymer s results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 
sales by cymer to its japanese subsidiary are denominated in dollars  and sales by the subsidiary to customers in japan are denominated in yen 
cymer s japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to such fluctuations by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge its cash flow exposure to cymer 
through june   gains or losses resulting from the change in the value of contracts entered into prior to july  are recorded as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
these gains and losses were included in cost of goods sold prior to the adoption of sfas subsequent to june   gains or losses resulting from contracts entered into after july  are initially recorded in other comprehensive income loss oci 
the net amount of unrealized effective gain or loss on the date the laser is received by cymer s japanese subsidiary is reclassified to cost of sale on the date that the laser is sold to the third party 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are accumulated as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity 
income tax provision 
the tax provision of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflect an annual effective rate of and  respectively 
the annual effective tax rates for both periods are less than the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of permanent book tax differences and tax credits 
years ended december  and revenues 
product sales increased from million in to million in  due primarily to improved market conditions and increased customer demand for lithography laser systems and spares 
these changes in conditions accounted for increases in unit sales of duv photolithography laser systems as well as increases in sales of spares  replacement parts  and services due to the higher installed base at chipmakers and increased utilization rates 
a total of laser systems were sold in compared to laser systems sold in with asps of  versus  respectively 
these higher asps are a direct result of new model introductions which command higher pricing and their adoption into the market place 
revenues generated from replacement parts increased from million in to million in  and revenues from service and service contracts increased from million in to million in revenues from funded development projects increased from  in to million in  primarily due to the timing of the addition and completion of certain programs 
approximately and of cymer s sales in and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the united states 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by cymer s japanese subsidiary  accounted for and of revenues in and  respectively 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales rose from million in to million in primarily in response to the increase in sales of product 
the gross margin on these sales increased from in to in primarily due to the increased product sales absorbing relatively fixed manufacturing and worldwide support infrastructure costs and continued operational efficiencies 
charges related to obsolete inventory remained consistent between and for the years ended december  and  net effective gains or losses from foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income in the same period as the related sales were recognized 
cymer recognized a net loss on such contracts of million in and a million net gain in research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to continued product development efforts associated with the els series laser systems and increased development efforts associated with els laser and arf laser development 
research and development expenses were also higher in as compared to due to increased staffing levels to support multiple new product development efforts and allocated costs associated with the move from the pre existing research and development facility into a new cymer owned facility  both located in san diego  california 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses fell from to in the respective periods due to the increase in cymer s revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased expenses associated with expanded operations in product marketing  new product development  and sales administration as well as additional expenses incurred to support the sales and marketing organizations internationally 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses decreased from to from period to period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this was due primarily to continued process improvements and the resulting operational efficiencies from the implementation and ongoing support of a new enterprise resource planning erp system which was completed in and the required general and administrative support activities 
general and administrative expenses also increased in due to the write off of computer systems made obsolete by the new erp system 
also included in general and administrative expenses for were additional allowances for outstanding trade accounts receivable and notes receivable totaling million and costs associated with the endowment of two professorship chairs for a total of  as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to in the respective periods 
other income expense net 
net other expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease in net expenses was primarily due to an increase in interest income in associated with the investment of excess cash offset by foreign currency exchange losses 
foreign currency exchange gain totaled  interest income totaled million  and interest expense totaled million in  compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of million  interest income of million  and interest expense of million in provision for income taxes 
the tax rate of zero and reported in and  respectively  reflect the tax benefits received from cymer s foreign sales corporation and us tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources since its initial public offering and a second public offering  both in  cymer has funded its operations primarily from the proceeds of convertible subordinated note offerings in august and february  bank borrowings  cash flow from operations and the proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
in august  cymer issued million in aggregate principal amount in a private placement of notes 
the notes were due on august   with interest payable semi annually on february and august  at per annum from august  through august  and per annum from august  to maturity or earlier redemption 
since november   the notes were convertible at the holder s option into shares of cymer common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount 
in june  cymer repurchased  of the notes outstanding for a total purchase price of million  including  in accrued interest 
in july  cymer repurchased an additional  of the notes outstanding for a total purchase price of million  including  in accrued interest 
as of december   million under the notes was outstanding 
the outstanding notes were called for redemption on march  prior to the march  redemption date  holders of million of the outstanding principal amount converted their notes into shares of cymer s common stock 
as a result of these conversions   shares of cymer s common stock were issued to the note holders and the remaining million of the outstanding principal amount of the notes was redeemed 
in february  cymer issued million in aggregate principal amount in a second private placement of notes 
these notes are due on february  with interest payable semi annually on february and august of each year at per annum 
the notes are convertible into shares of cymer common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount 
cymer used a portion of the net proceeds from this private placement to redeem the notes issued in august as of december   cymer had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million in long term investments 
as of december   cymer had million in working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in resulted from increased depreciation  significant reductions in liabilities  and an increase in net income offset by increases in accounts receivable 
in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a significant increase in net income 
increases in inventory  accounts receivable  and income taxes payable resulted from increased revenues and bookings in and were offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities during the year 
cash provided by operating activities during primarily reflects a significant reduction in net income due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry during as a result of this downturn and overall reduced business activities during the period  there were significant decreases in accounts receivable and inventory during the period 
these were offset by decreases in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  and income taxes payable during the same period 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the cash used in investing activities of million during primarily reflects the purchase of various types of manufacturing and test equipment  research and development tools  and the addition of tenant improvements for the field service and manufacturing organizations  all in support of business expansion during the year 
during  these property acquisitions were offset by the timing of purchases and sales of investments during the same period 
in  cash used in investing activities increased significantly from and totaled million for the period 
this increase in investing activities was primarily due to property acquisitions to accommodate the increased business activities in included in this million were equipment purchases  the construction of an additional facility at the san diego  california location totaling million  the purchase and the deployment of a new erp system totaling million  and a purchase of an additional undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the san diego  california facility for million 
in addition  million in cash was used in to acquire the minority interest in cymer s taiwan subsidiary 
in  the cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the timing of short term and long term investments maturing and being reinvested during the period offset by a million payment made to acquire patents and the purchase of million in capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively  whereas cash used in financing activities was million in in  financing activities generated million of net cash primarily from the exercise of employee stock options totaling million  as well as a million increase in net borrowings under a revolving loan and security agreement 
in  the million net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to million in employee stock option exercises offset by a million payment made during the year on cymer s revolving loan 
in  the cash used in financing activities was attributable to the repurchase of million in outstanding notes and a net payment on the revolving loan of million during the period offset by the receipt of million from the exercise of employee stock options 
cymer requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
cymer s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including cymer s manufacturing activity  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  expansion of sales and marketing and field service and support  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of cymer s products 
cymer believes that it has sufficient working capital and available banking arrangements to sustain operations and provide for the future expansion of its business for at least the next months 
the following summarizes cymer s contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   and the effect such obligations could have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands amount of commitment expiring by period thereafter capital leases payable operating leases payable      convertible subordinated notes  total commitment      subsequent to december   the convertible subordinated notes included in the above table were called for redemption 
prior to the march  redemption date  holders of million of the outstanding principal amount converted their notes to shares of cymer s common stock 
the remaining million of the outstanding principal amount of the notes was redeemed 
on february   cymer closed the private placement of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due february  a portion of the proceeds from this transaction were used to redeem the outstanding step up convertible subordinated notes 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates cymer s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon cymer s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires cymer to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of its on going internal processes  cymer evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  warranty obligations  installation obligations  revenue recognition  allowances for bad debt  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes  investments  and contingencies and litigation 
cymer bases these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that it believes valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
cymer believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
cymer maintains an inventory allowance to record inventory at net realizable value 
the value of this allowance is determined by taking into consideration certain assumptions related to market conditions and future demands for its products which may result in excess or obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than projected by management  adjustments to this inventory allowance may be required to more accurately value inventory 
cymer provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with cymer s different product models 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although cymer engages in product improvement programs and processes  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures at customer sites 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from cymer s estimates  revisions to its estimated warranty provision would be required 
factors that may affect financial condition and future results cymer participates in an industry that is very cyclical in nature and subject to rapid technological changes and demands by its customers 
the following are important risks factors that could affect actual results and cause them to differ materially from the projected results in the forward looking statements in this report cymer s business depends on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is volatile  cymer depends on the introduction of new products for its success  and is subject to risks associated with rapid technological change  a significant percentage of cymer s revenue is derived from sales to a few large customers  and if cymer is not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  cymer s revenues would be reduced and its financial results would suffer  a substantial percentage of cymer s revenue is derived from the sale of a limited number of primary products  cymer depends on a few key suppliers for purchasing components and subassemblies that are included in its products  cymer faces competition from two other companies that have more resources than cymer and cymer may face competition from additional competitors who enter the marker  cymer depends on key personnel  especially management and technical personnel  who may be difficult to attract and retain in an expanding market  failure to maintain effectively cymer s direct field service and support organization could have a material adverse effect on its business  cymer s ability to compete could be jeopardized if it is unable to protect its intellectual property rights 
these types of claims could seriously harm cymer s business or require cymer to incur significant costs  the parties to whom cymer provides research and development services may dispute the ownership of the intellectual property that cymer develops performing these services  in the future  cymer may be subject to patent litigation to enforce patents issued to cymer and have to defend itself against claimed infringement by cymer s competitors or any third party  trademark infringement claims against cymer s registered and unregistered trademarks would be expensive and cymer may have to stop using such trademarks and pay damages  economic  political  regulatory and other events in geographic areas where cymer has significant sales or operations could interfere with cymer s business  cymer is exposed to risks related to the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the japanese yen  semiconductor device manufacturers prolonged use of cymer s product in high volume productions may not produce the results they desire  and as a result  cymer s reputation could be damaged in the semiconductor industry as well as with cymer s customers who supply photolithography tools to the semiconductor manufacturers  cymer has in the past and may in the future acquire businesses that will involve numerous risks 
cymer may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational and financial problems  cymer s acquisition of acx may not result in the benefits that it anticipated  cymer must develop and manufacture enhancements to its existing products and introduce new products in order to grow its business 
cymer may not effectively manage its growth and integrate these new enhancements and products  which could materially harm its business  cymer s products are subject to potential product liability claims if personal injury or death result  and the price of cymer s common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
at december  and  cymer did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  cymer did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  cymer is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
cymer does not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with the company or its related parties except as disclosed herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must satisfy to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
cymer adopted the provisions of sfas on july  and is required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective january  furthermore  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that is acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized in accordance with accounting treatment in effect prior to the adoption of sfas on january  sfas will require upon adoption of sfas that cymer evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  cymer will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  cymer will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas will require cymer to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this cymer must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
cymer will then determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and cymer must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  cymer must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of it assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
cymer is currently working on the first step of the goodwill impairment evaluation under sfas and expects to have it completed during the second quarter of as of the date of adoption and prior to any reclassification adjustments  cymer expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  both of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and amortization expense related to goodwill was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets was  for the year ended december  there was no such amortization expense for intangible assets for the year ended december  cymer is still in the early stages of the evaluation process for sfas but at this time there has been no identified impairment of these intangible assets 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas applies to tangible long lived assets that have a legal obligation associated with their retirement that results from the acquisition  construction or development or normal use of the asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
cymer is required to adopt the provisions of sfas during the quarter ending march  it is not anticipated that the financial impact of this statement will have a material effect on cymer s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas  including the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion no 
 for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in opinion no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  it is not anticipated that the financial impact of this statement will have a material effect on cymer s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors in this section  references to we  us or our are references to cymer 
our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors 
our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter may fluctuate significantly due to many factors 
these factors include demand for semiconductors in general and  in particular  for leading edge devices with smaller circuit geometries  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  rates at which semiconductor device manufacturers take delivery of photolithography tools from our customers  rates at which our customers take delivery of light sources from us  timing and size of orders from our small base of customers  mix of laser models  replacement parts and service revenues in our total revenues  utilization rates of lasers and sales for replacement parts and services  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  principally with respect to the japanese yen in which sales by our japanese subsidiary are denominated 
also  we have historically derived a large portion of our quarterly and annual revenues from selling a small number of laser systems 
because we sell a small number of products  the precise time that we recognize revenue from an order may have a significant impact on our total revenue for a particular period 
our customers may cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalty 
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another period due to changes in the anticipated timing of customers purchase decisions or rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers 
our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers cancel or reschedule orders  or if we cannot fill orders in time due to unexpected delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping  and product acceptance 
we manage our expense levels based  in large part  on expected future revenues 
as a result  our expenses are relatively fixed for the short term  and if our actual revenue decreases below the level we expect  our operating results will be adversely affected 
our business depends on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is volatile 
we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from photolithography tool manufacturers our customers 
our customers depend in turn on the demand for their photolithography tool products from their customers  the semiconductor device manufacturers 
the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic downturns and is currently in a significant downturn 
this current downturn has had a severe effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including photolithography tools that our customers produce 
we have sized our operations in recent years in response to rapid changes in demand 
throughout  semiconductor device manufacturers reduced their capital spending as demand for semiconductors decreased 
similarly  during we experienced reductions in spare parts purchases as semiconductor production levels dropped 
if overall market conditions continue to deteriorate in the near term  our current operating levels may negatively impact our profitability 
we believe that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will periodically occur  and result in periodic decreases in demand for all semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including photolithography tools our customers manufacture 
as a result  fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor device manufacturers and pricing volatility will continue to materially affect our aggregate bookings  revenues and operating results 
also  even during periods of reduced revenues we believe we must continue to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive  which may temporarily harm our financial results 
accordingly  these downturns are likely to continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results and our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
such failure to meet operating result expectations would materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our customers try to manage their inventories and production requirements to appropriate levels that best reflect their expected sales to semiconductor device manufacturers 
market conditions in the industry and production efficiency of the photolithography tool manufacturers can cause our customers to expand or reduce their orders for new laser systems as they try to manage their inventories and production requirements to these levels 
we are working with our customers to better understand these issues 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in understanding our customers inventory management and production requirements or that our customers will not build up an excess inventory of laser products 
if our customers retain an excess inventory of laser products  our revenue could be reduced in future periods as the excess inventory is utilized  which would adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we depend on the introduction of new products for our success  and we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 
rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop  manufacture and timely introduce new laser products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing laser systems and process capabilities 
due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products  we must forecast accurately demand for new products while managing the transition from older products 
we believe that semiconductor device manufacturers are currently developing a capability to produce devices that are measured at 
micron or less  and these efforts are driving the current demand for our laser systems for duv photolithography systems 
after semiconductor device manufacturers have this capability  their demand for our laser products will depend on whether they want to expand their capacity to manufacture these devices 
this will in turn depend on whether their sales forecasts and projected manufacturing process yields justify the necessary investments 
future technologies  such as euv and scalpel processes  may render our excimer laser products obsolete 
we must manage product transitions  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
if new products are not introduced on time  or have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely or cost effective manner that satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
failure to develop and introduce these new products and enhancements could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products to this market  which may affect our ability to sell our new products 
furthermore  new products represent significant investments of our resources and their success  or lack thereof  could have a material effect on our financial results 
a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from sales to a few large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
three large firms  asm lithography  nikon and canon dominate the photolithography tool business 
collectively  these three firms accounted for the following percentage of our total revenue during the periods indicated year ended december  asm lithography nikon canon total we expect that sales of our laser products to these three customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
none of our customers are obligated to purchase a minimum number of our products 
the loss of any significant business from or production problems for any one of these three customers will have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
sales to these customers may be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include a change in a customer s competitive position in its industry  a decision to purchase laser or light sources from other suppliers  and changes in economic conditions in the semiconductor or the photolithography tool industries 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from the sale of a limited number of primary products 
our only product line is excimer lasers  which include krypton fluoride  argon fluoride and fluorine laser systems  and we expect these primary products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our primary products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
the primary market for excimer laser light sources is in the use of deep ultraviolet photolithography equipment for manufacturing deep submicron semiconductor devices using smaller circuit geometries 
the demand for our products depends in part on the rate at which semiconductor device manufacturers further adopt excimer lasers as the chosen light source for their photolithography tools 
semiconductor manufacturers may choose not to adopt excimer lasers for a variety of reasons  including instability of photoresists used in advanced duv photolithography  and potential shortages of specialized materials used in duv optics 
we cannot guarantee that these factors can or will be overcome or that the demand for our excimer laser products will not be materially reduced 
the demand for our laser products  and therefore our operating results  financial condition and cash flows  could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including a decline in demand for our customers duv photolithography tools  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
we must effectively manage changes in our business 
in order to respond to the business cycles of the semiconductor industry  in the past few years we have sharply expanded and contracted the scope of our operations and the number of employees in many of our departments 
as the semiconductor industry grows and contracts we will need to closely manage our domestic and international operations  improve our accounting and other internal management systems  improve our quality control  order fulfillment  field service and customer support capabilities  quickly adapt to changing sales and marketing channels  effectively manage our inventory levels  and attract  train  retain and manage key technical personnel  if we fail to effectively manage changes in our business  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows  would be adversely affected 
we depend on a few key suppliers for purchasing components and subassemblies that are included in our products 
we purchase some of the components and subassemblies included in our laser products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
for some of these components and subassemblies  including specific optical components used in our lasers  there are no alternative sources of supply 
in addition  we outsource the manufacture of various subassemblies more often than in the past 
further  some of our suppliers have specialized in supplying equipment or manufacturing services to semiconductor equipment manufacturers and therefore have been adversely affected by the current industry downturn 
if the current downturn continues for an extended period of time  these suppliers may not be able to continue to meet our requirements or respond quickly enough when the recovery begins 
due to the nature of our product development requirements  these key suppliers must rapidly advance their own technologies and production capabilities in order to support the introduction schedule of our new products 
these suppliers may not be able to provide new modules and subassemblies when they are needed to satisfy our product schedule requirements 
if we cannot purchase enough of these materials  components or subassemblies  or if these items do not meet our quality standards  there could be delays or reductions in our product shipments  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we face competition from two companies that have more resources than us and may face competition from additional competitors who enter the market 
we are currently aware of two significant competitors that sell laser systems for duv photolithography applications 
these competitors are gigaphoton  a joint venture between two large companies  komatsu and ushio  which is headquartered in japan  and lambda physik  a company headquartered in germany 
both of these companies have parent companies larger than us  and have access to greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
we believe that gigaphoton and lambda physik are aggressively trying to gain a larger market share in the excimer laser industry 
we believe that our customers have purchased products from these two competitors and that our customers have approved these competitors lasers for use with their products 
we believe that gigaphoton  in particular  has been approved by chipmakers in japan and elsewhere for producing excimer lasers 
also  we believe that lambda physik has been approved by chipmakers in the us and europe for producing excimer laser products 
the market for excimer lasers is still small and immature 
larger competitors with substantially greater resources  such as other manufacturers of industrial light sources for advanced lithography  may attempt to sell competitive products to our customers 
potential competitors may also be attracted to our growing installed base of laser light sources and may attempt to supply consumable products and refurbished parts to that installed base 
if any existing or future competitors gain market acceptance we could lose market share and our growth could slow or decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we depend on key personnel  especially management and technical personnel  who may be difficult to attract and retain in an expanding market 
we are highly dependent on the services of many key employees in various areas  including engineering  research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing 
in particular  there are a limited number of experts in excimer laser technology  and we require highly skilled hardware and software engineers 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed 
we have in the past experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty in hiring personnel  including experts in excimer laser technology 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees 
we believe that our future growth and operating results will depend on the continued services of our engineering  research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing and service personnel  our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled personnel in each of these areas  and the ability of our personnel and key employees to continue to expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain key personnel as required  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
failure to maintain effectively our direct field service and support organization could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe it is critical for us to provide quick and responsive service directly to the semiconductor device manufacturers throughout the world who use our laser products in their photolithography systems  and that it is essential to maintain our own personnel or trained third party resources to provide these services 
accordingly  we have an ongoing effort to develop our direct support system with locations in the united states  japan  europe  korea  singapore  taiwan and southeast asia 
this requires us to do the following recruit and train qualified field service personnel  identify qualified independent firms  and maintain effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to our customers in various countries 
we have experienced difficulties in training field service personnel 
we might not be able to attract and train qualified personnel to maintain our director support operations successfully 
further  we may incur significant costs in providing these support services 
failure to implement our direct support operation effectively could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
these types of claims could seriously harm our business or require us to incur significant costs 
we believe our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
as of december   we had registered united states patents covering certain aspects of technology related to excimer lasers and piezo techniques 
these patents will expire at various times during the period from january to february as of december   we also had applied for additional patents in the united states 
as of december   we owned foreign patents and had filed patent applications pending in various foreign countries 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with a competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  third parties patents might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
as a result of cost constraints  we did not begin filing in japan and other countries our patents for inventions covered by united states patents and patent applications until as a result we might have lost the right to seek foreign patent protection for some of our early inventions 
additionally  laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
thus  the possibility of piracy of our technology and products are more likely in these countries 
further  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or  design around patents that are granted to us 
other companies or persons may have filed or may file in the future patent applications that are similar or identical to ours 
we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office in order for the patent office to determine the priority of inventions 
the patent office may determine that these third party patent applications have priority over our patent applications 
these interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we also rely on the following to protect our confidential information and our other intellectual property trade secret protection  employee nondisclosure agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods 
however  we may not be successful in protecting our confidential information and intellectual property  particularly our trade secrets  because third parties may independently develop substantially the same proprietary information and techniques  gain access to our trade secrets  or disclose our technology 
the parties to whom we provide research and development services may dispute the ownership of the intellectual property that we develop performing these services 
in the past  revenues from research and development arrangements with third parties have been used to pay for a portion of our own research and development expenses 
we receive these revenues from photolithography tool manufacturers and from sematech in connection with our designing and developing specific products 
currently  revenues from sematech  photolithography tool manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers are used to fund a small portion of our development expenses 
in providing these research and development services to these manufacturers and sematech  we try to make clear who owns the intellectual property that results from the research and development services we perform 
however  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market these intellectual property may arise between us and the photolithography tool manufacturers and sematech 
any dispute over ownership of the intellectual property we develop could restrict our ability to market our products and have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the future  we may be subject to patent litigation to enforce patents issued to us and defend ourselves against claimed infringement by our competitors or any other third party 
third parties have notified us in the past  and may notify us in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
also  we have notified third parties in the past  and may notify them in the future  that they may be infringing our intellectual property rights 
specifically  komatsu has notified us that we may be infringing some of its japanese patents 
during our discussions with komatsu  they also asserted that we or our japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  may be infringing on some of komatsu s united states patents and a number of its additional japanese patents 
komatsu has also notified one of our customers  nikon  of its belief that our lasers infringe several of komatsu s japanese and us patents 
as a result  we started proceedings in the japanese patent office to oppose certain patents and patent applications of komatsu 
the japanese patent office has dismissed some of our opposition claims 
thus  litigation may result in connection with komatsu s japanese patents or us patents 
also  komatsu might claim that we infringe other or additional patents 
komatsu notified seiko  our manufacturing partner  that it intends to enforce its rights against seiko with respect to its japanese patents if seiko continues to engage in manufacturing activities for us 
in connection with our manufacturing agreement with seiko  we agree to pay seiko under certain conditions for damages associated with these types of claims 
seiko may not prevail in any litigation against komatsu  and therefore  we may be required to pay seiko for such damages 
we have notified our competitors and others of our united states patent portfolio 
specifically  we have notified komatsu that it may be infringing on some of our us patents 
currently  we are discussing with komatsu our claims against each other 
these discussions may not be successful and litigation could result 
komatsu challenged one of our us patents in the united states patent office 
also  komatsu transferred its lithography laser business to one of our competitors  gigaphoton 
we also have had discussions with lambda physik  another competitor  regarding allegations by each party against the other for possible patent infringement 
any of these discussions with our competitors may not be successful and litigation could result 
in the future  patent litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us and defend us against claimed infringement by our competitors or any other third party 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by us  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our customers and the end users of our products might assert other claims for indemnification that arise from infringement claims against them 
if these assertions are successful  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially effected 
instead of litigation  we may seek a license from third parties to use their intellectual property 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms 
in the alternative  we may design around the third party s intellectual property right or we may challenge these claims in legal proceedings 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding could result in the following  any of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results loss of our proprietary rights  exposure to significant liabilities by other third parties  requirement that we get a license from third parties on terms that are not favorable  or restriction from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of cymer s management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trademark infringement claims against our registered and unregistered trademarks would be expensive and we may have to stop using such trademarks and pay damages 
we registered the trademark cymer in the united states and in some other countries 
we are also trying to register additional trademarks in the united states in other countries  including the trademark insist on cymer 
we use these trademarks and many other marks in our advertisements and other business materials  which are distributed throughout the world 
we may be subject to trademark infringement actions for using these marks and other marks on a worldwide basis and this would be very expensive to defend 
if a trademark infringement action was successful  we would have to stop using the mark and possibly pay damages 
if seiko discontinues producing our laser in japan due to patent infringement claims made by komatsu  our ability to meet the demand for our product in japan could be materially adversely effected 
we have approved seiko as a qualified manufacturer of our excimer lasers 
komatsu has told seiko that certain aspects of our lasers may infringe on komatsu s japanese patents 
further  komatsu advised seiko that it intends to enforce its rights under such japanese patents against seiko if seiko continues to manufacture excimer laser products for us 
in connection with our manufacturing agreement with seiko  we have agreed to indemnify seiko against any such claims under certain circumstances 
to date  komatsu has not initiated any such legal action 
if seiko stops manufacturing our laser products in japan because of komatsu s claims  our ability to manufacturer lasers that are in demand in such area could be materially and adversely effected 
economic  political  regulatory and other events in geographic areas where we have significant sales or operations could interfere with our business 
a large portion of our total revenues are derived from foreign customers located outside of the united states  particularly in asian countries 
our foreign customers accounted for or more of our total revenue in each of the last three fiscal years 
because a significant majority of our principal customers are located in asian countries  we expect our international sales to continue to account for a very large portion of our total revenues 
in order to support our foreign customers  we must maintain subsidiaries located in japan  korea  taiwan  singapore and the netherlands  further develop our field service and support operations throughout the world  and continue to work with seiko as a contract manufacturer of our laser products in japan 
we may not be able to manage our operations to address and support our foreign customers effectively 
further  our investments in these types of activities may not make us competitive in the international market or we may not be able to meet the service and support levels required by our foreign customers 
additionally  we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates and currency controls  political and economic conditions and instability  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions  including changes in tariff and freight rates  foreign customs and duties  difficulty in coordinating our management and operations in several different countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  limited intellectual property protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences in some countries  the possibility of accounts receivable collection difficulties  in the case of asia  the risk of business interruption and damage from earthquakes  the effect of acts of terrorism and war  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
many of our major customers and many of the semiconductor device manufacturers who use our laser products in their photolithography systems are located in asia 
economic problems and currency fluctuations affecting these regions in asia could create a larger risk for us 
further  even though it has not been difficult for us to comply with united states export controls  these export rules could change in the future and make it more difficult or impossible for us to export our products to many countries 
any of these vulnerabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on air transport to conduct our business and disruption of domestic and international air transport systems could adversely effect our business 
we depend on regular and reliable air transportation on a worldwide basis for many of our routine business functions 
if civil aviation in the united states or abroad is disrupted by terrorist activities or security responses to the threat of terrorism or for any other reason  our business could be adversely affected in the following ways supplies of raw materials and components for the manufacture of our products or our customers products may be disrupted  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner  we may not be able to provide timely support of installed lasers for semiconductor device manufacturers  and our sales and marketing efforts may be disrupted 
we are exposed to risks related to the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the japanese yen 
if we sell products to our japanese subsidiary  the sale is denominated in united states dollars 
if our japanese subsidiary sells directly to customers in japan  the sale is denominated in japanese yen 
thus  our results of operations may fluctuate based on the changing value of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
our japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to these fluctuations through foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge its purchase commitments 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to these currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  use hedging transactions to minimize the effect of these currency fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the future  we may need to sell our products in other foreign currencies other than the japanese yen and the management of more currency fluctuations will be more difficult and expose us to greater risks in this area 
we are subject to many standards and regulations of foreign governments and  even though we intend to comply  we may not always be in compliance with these rules  or we may be unable to design or redesign our products to comply with these rules 
many foreign countries government standards and regulations apply to our products 
these standards and regulations are always being amended 
although we intend to meet all foreign standards and regulations  our products may not comply with these foreign government standards and regulations or the amendments made to them 
further  it might not be cost effective for us to redesign our products to comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
our inability to design or redesign products to comply with foreign standards would result in noncompliance with these standards and regulations  and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 
semiconductor device manufacturers prolonged use of our product in high volume productions may not produce the results they desire  and as a result  our reputation could be damaged in the semiconductor industry as well as our customers who supply photolithography tools to the semiconductor manufacturers 
over time  our laser products may not meet semiconductor device manufacturers production specifications or operating cost requirements after the laser is used for a long period in high volume production 
if any semiconductor device manufacturer cannot successfully achieve or sustain their volume production using our lasers  our reputation could be damaged with the semiconductor device manufacturers and our customers who are the limited number of photolithography tool manufacturers 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire business that will involve numerous risks 
we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational and financial problems 
the risks involved with acquiring a new company include the following diversion of management s attention and resources to integrate the new company  failure to retain key personnel  amortization of acquired definite lived intangible assets and deferred compensation  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company  the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations  ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections  and assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
further  any business that we acquire may not achieve anticipated revenues or operating results 
our acquisition of acx may not result in the benefits we anticipate 
in february  we completed our purchase of acx now referred to as cymer cambridge 
cymer cambridge s technology addresses stability and motion control challenges that we believe will be important to the future of the photolithography tool industry 
we purchased cymer cambridge with the expectation that the purchase would result in benefits to us including expanding our product offerings into the field of adaptive precision motion diagnostics and control  new product offerings and enhancements that use the acx technology to solve stability and motion control challenges  and cymer cambridge s products being successfully accepted by the semiconductor industry 
we cannot guarantee that cymer cambridge can achieve anticipated revenues  or that the acx technology will solve stability and motion control challenges which is important to the future semiconductor 
any of these risks could materially harm our business and condition and results of operations 
further  we cannot guarantee that we can effectively develop or market the acx technology  or the technology of any newly acquired businesses 
we must develop and manufacture enhancements to our existing products and introduce new products in order to continue to grow our business 
we may not effectively manage our growth and integrate these new enhancements and products  which could materially harm our business 
to continue to grow our business  our existing laser products and their process capabilities must be enhanced  and we must develop and manufacture new products to serve other semiconductor applications 
we have entered into strategic agreements and acquired cymer cambridge in order to achieve these goals 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage our growth effectively 
nor can we guarantee that we will be able to accelerate the development of new enhancements to our existing products and create new products 
further  we may not be able to effectively integrate new products and applications into our current operations 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to environmental and other government regulations that may expose us to liabilities for noncompliance 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations  such as regulations related to the environment  land use  public utility utilization and the fire code  in connection with the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances that we use in our manufacturing process and on our facilities that we lease 
we believe that our activities comply with current government regulations that are applicable to our operations and current facilities 
we may be required to purchase additional capital equipment or other requirements for our processes to comply with these government regulations in the future if they change 
further  these government regulations may restrict us from expanding our operations 
adopting measures to comply with changes in the government regulations  our failure to comply with environmental and land use regulations  or restrictions on our ability to discharge hazardous substances  could subject us to future liability or cause our manufacturing operations to be reduced or stopped 
our products are subject to potential product liability claims if personal injury or death result 
we are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if personal injury or death results from the use of our products 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we maintain insurance against product liability claims 
however  our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept 
this insurance coverage also may not be enough for liabilities that are actually incurred 
further  if our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign these products 
a successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level  or any claim or product recall that results in adverse publicity against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past 
the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including the risk factors contained in this report 
various factors may significantly affect the market price of common stock  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  conditions and trends in the laser device and other technology industries  announcements of innovations in technology  new products offered by us or our competitors  developments of patents or proprietary rights  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies 
such fluctuations have in some cases been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
severe price fluctuations in a company s stock have frequently been followed by securities litigation 
we are currently defending litigation related to our stock price 
any such litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and therefore could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently defending class action lawsuits related to the trading of our securities  and this litigation can result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we are named as defendant in several stockholder class action lawsuits that were filed in september and october  in the federal district courts of california 
some of our officers and directors are also named as defendants 
the plaintiffs represent a class of all persons who purchased our stock between april  and september  the complaints allege claims under the federal securities laws  and the plaintiffs claim that we made various material misrepresentations and omissions during this period of time 
the complaints do not seek a specific dollar amount for damages 
the court consolidated all of the complaints into one single action and a class representative was appointed 
a consolidated amended complaint was filed in early august  on november   we and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss this consolidated complaint for the plaintiffs failure to state a cause of action 
on april   the court granted our motion to dismiss with leave to amend the complaint by the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs filed their second amended consolidated complaint on june  we then moved to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint on august  on october   the court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint with prejudice and entered a judgment in favor of all defendants against all plaintiffs 
on october   the plaintiffs appealed the judgment to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
while the appeal is still pending  the plaintiffs have recently notified cymer that they intend to voluntarily dismiss the appeal 
upon dismissal of the appeal  the case will have ended and the judgment of the lower court in favor of cymer will become final 
to protect our company from hostile takeovers  we implemented a program authorizing shares of preferred stock which may have rights and preferences that are superior to our common stock 
nevada law and our articles of incorporation contain provisions that discourage a proxy contest and provisions that make an acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock more difficult 
in addition  our board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock 
shares of preferred stock may have voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to those of the common stock and this could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of holders of common stock 
our board can use the issuance of the preferred stock or rights to purchase the preferred stock to discourage any unsolicited acquisition proposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk cymer conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations 
due to the large volume of business cymer manages in japan  the japanese operation poses the greatest foreign currency risk 
cymer uses financial instruments  principally forward exchange contracts  in japan to manage its foreign currency exposures 
cymer enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations related to purchases of cymer s inventories by cymer japan for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
cymer does not enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
at december   cymer had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts to buy us million for billion yen under foreign currency exchange facilities with contract rates ranging from yen to yen per us dollar 
these contracts expire on various expiration dates through september investment and debt risk cymer maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
while it is cymer s general intent to hold such securities until maturity  cymer will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  cymer s investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
due to the conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
in august  cymer issued million aggregate principal amount in a private placement of notes 
these step up convertible subordinated notes notes were due august   with interest payable semi annually on february and august  commencing february  interest on the notes was per annum from august  through august  and is per annum from august  to maturity or earlier redemption  representing a yield to maturity accrued at approximately 
since november   the notes have been convertible at the option of the holder into shares of cymer common stock of cymer at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the notes became redeemable by cymer on august  the notes were unsecured and subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness of cymer 
the indenture governing the notes did not restrict the incurrence of senior indebtedness or other indebtedness by cymer 
these notes are recorded at face value on the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of such debt  based on quoted market prices at december  was million 
as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  in notes were outstanding 
during the first quarter of   of the notes were converted into  shares of common stock 
in june  cymer repurchased  of outstanding notes for a total repurchase price of million  including  in accrued interest 
in july  cymer repurchased an additional  of outstanding notes for a total repurchase price of million  including  in accrued interest 
the outstanding notes were called for redemption on march  prior to the march  redemption date  holders of million of the outstanding principal amount converted their notes into shares of cymer s common stock 
as a result of these conversions   shares of cymer s common stock were issued to the note holders and the remaining million of the outstanding principal amount of the notes was redeemed 
in february  cymer issued million in aggregate principal amount in a second private placement of notes 
the notes are unsecured and are due on february  with interest payable semi annually on february and august of each year at per annum 
the notes are convertible into shares of cymer common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount 
cymer used a portion of the net proceeds from this private placement to redeem the notes issued in august
