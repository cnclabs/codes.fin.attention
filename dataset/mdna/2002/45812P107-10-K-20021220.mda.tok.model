at september   we owned approximately of icsi  approximately of nexflash  approximately of e cmos and approximately of getsilicon 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies which are impacted by estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  and iv the valuation of our non marketable equity securities  which impacts gains and losses on 
table of contents equity securities when we record impairments 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult  for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended september  valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining market value requires us to project unit prices and volumes for future periods in which we expect to sell inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
as a result of these estimates  we may record a charge to cost of goods sold  which decreases our gross profit  in advance of when the inventory is actually sold to reflect market values that are below our manufacturing and sales commission costs 
conversely  if we sell inventory that has previously been written down to the lower of cost or market at more favorable prices than we had forecasted at the time of the write down  our gross profit may be higher 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess or obsolete 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand in excess of six months estimated sales volumes to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made to the forecast based on our judgments for newer products  end of life products or planned inventory increases 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns and allowances 
this reserve is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
because the reserve for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
valuation of non marketable securities our ability to recover our investments in equity securities that are non marketable and to earn a return on these investments is largely dependent on financial market conditions and the occurrence of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers or acquisitions and private party transactions 
all of these events are difficult to predict  particularly in the current economic environment 
in addition  under our accounting policy  we are required to periodically review all of our investments for impairment 
in the case of non marketable equity securities  this requires significant judgment on our part  including an assessment of the investees financial condition  the existence of subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences  as well as the investees historical results of operations  and projected results and cash flows 
if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from their forecasts  the carrying value of our non marketable equity securities may be overstated  and we may incur additional charges in 
table of contents future periods  which will decrease our profitability 
at september   our strategic investments in non marketable securities totaled million of which million was invested in smic 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales was principally due to a significant decline in the average selling prices of our products in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we experienced a decrease in unit shipments for our sram products  specifically our k x  k  k and k x sram products 
we were able to partially offset the decline in our dram revenue resulting from the decline in average selling prices with an increase in dram units shipped 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
in this regard  we experienced a decline in the average selling prices for certain of our sram and dram products in the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june  we anticipate further price declines for certain of our sram and dram products in the december quarter 
there can be no assurance that such declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco systems  inc shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal sales to com accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal as sales to these customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and no purchasing contract exists  these customers can cease doing business with us at any time 
gross profit loss 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly costs and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance and import duties 
gross profit decreased to a loss of million in fiscal from a profit of million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million  predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on our dram and sram products and  to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
we recorded inventory write downs of million in fiscal these write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products  primarily drams and low power srams 
in fiscal  we charged million to cost of sales for the write off of a prepaid license fee as the average selling price for the impacted parts were less than the cost of the parts 
additionally  the technology included in the license had no alternative use to us beyond its application in the impacted parts 
as a result of the termination of the antidumping case  our gross margin for fiscal benefited from the reversal of approximately million in antidumping duties previously charged to cost of sales 
excluding the inventory write downs  the write off of the prepaid license fee and the benefit of the reversal of antidumping duties  the decrease in gross profit was principally due to a significant decline in the average selling prices of our products in fiscal compared to fiscal further  as we sell products that had previously been written down to lower of cost or market  we recognize minimal gross profit 
the decline in our gross margin in fiscal was more significant for our sram products than for our dram products 
in addition  we were able to offset some of the decline in average selling prices of our dram products with an increase in dram units shipped 
we believe that the average selling price of our products will generally decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in this regard  we experienced a significant decline in the average selling prices for certain of our sram and dram products in the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june  we anticipate a further decline in the average selling prices for certain of our sram and dram products in the three months ending december  in addition  product unit costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
although we have product cost reduction programs in 
table of contents place for certain products that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was the result our acquisition of purple ray  the expansion of our research and development activities in asia  and increased expenses for engineering wafers related to the development of new products 
in the three months ended september  we wrote off the unamortized balance of the purple ray patent applications of approximately million 
the write off was made as it became evident  based on anticipated cash flows  that the product line had not and would not meet the goals that we had at the time the acquisition was made and that we would not recover any value for the patent applications 
while we have made efforts to reduce research and development expenses through salary reductions  lay offs and the transfer of some design and engineering efforts to asia  these reductions may be offset by increased costs for the development of new products  which could result in our research and development expenses increasing in absolute dollars in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily the result of decreased selling commissions associated with lower revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  payroll related expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of salary reductions and reductions in headcount 
as a result of expense controls  such as salary and headcount reductions  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses may decrease in future quarters although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
acquired in process technology 
on february   we acquired purple ray  inc  a development stage company 
the assets of purple ray consisted primarily of intellectual property 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the total estimated purchase price of million consisted of the fair market value of issi s common stock issued of million  the fair value of options to purchase purple ray common stock assumed by issi of million  and estimated transaction costs of million 
approximately  additional shares of issi common stock may be issued contingent upon meeting certain milestones in relation to one of the products under development 
in connection with the acquisition of purple ray in fiscal  we allocated million of the total purchase price of million to in process technology 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows related to the in process projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
management is primarily responsible for estimating the fair value of the in process technology  which was determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser 
at the acquisition date  purple ray was developing four cam and nsp products that were expected to feature sophisticated parallel search architecture to enhance lookup performance for oc and advanced data communication equipment 
the products under development ranged from to complete 
we allocated values to in process technology based on the stage of development of each product  the time and resources needed to complete each product  and the expected income and associated risks 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the products  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process technology was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the expected timing of new product introductions 
the resulting net cash flows from such products are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such product offerings 

table of contents revenues for the products under development were estimated to grow based on forecasted sales for the three years following introduction  assuming successful completion and market acceptance of the products under development 
the estimated revenues for the in process products were expected to peak within four years of acquisition and then decline as other new products and technologies are expected to enter the market 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on an estimated cost of capital calculation 
we utilized a discount rate of for the in process technology  which we believe is commensurate with the inherent risk and the expected growth of the in process products 
the estimates we used in valuing in process technology were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net decreased by million to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  the decrease was primarily the result of decreased interest income as the result of the decline in interest rates and lower cash balances 
in addition  fiscal includes a write off of approximately million for the impairment of certain of our equity investments 
gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investments decreased by million to  in fiscal from million in fiscal in the year ended september   we sold shares of icsi for approximately  resulting in a pre tax gain of  in the year ended september  we sold our interest in wafertech to tsmc for approximately million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
during the year ended september   we also recorded gross proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million in connection with our sale of shares of icsi  and gross proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million in connection with our sale of shares of nexflash 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended september  compared to a tax expense of  for the year ended september  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended september   that principally reflects our ability to recover alternative minimum taxes previously incurred as a result of changes in tax law in we recorded a tax expense of  for the year ended september   primarily due to the inability to realize deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  partially offset by the reversal of taxes previously provided for foreign operations no longer deemed necessary as the statute of limitations had expired 
minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary 
in october  we invested million for a interest in dcode co 
inc dcode  a subsidiary that we established in korea to focus on semiconductor design activities 
the results of their operations are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the  minority interest in net loss of consolidated subsidiary  represents the minority shareholders proportionate share of the net loss of dcode 
equity in net income loss of affiliated companies 
equity in net income loss of affiliated companies decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this primarily reflects a decrease in income from our percentage share of icsi s financial results in fiscal from fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in sales was principally due to an increase in unit shipments  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price  of our megabit dram products  as well as increased unit shipments of certain sram products  specifically our k  k  k  and k sram products 
in addition  the average selling prices of our sram products generally increased in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco systems  inc shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal sales to com accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
however  in fiscal  shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million  including million in the three months ended september  the inventory write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on certain of our products  primarily drams and low power srams  and to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
excluding the inventory write downs in fiscal  gross profit for the period was million or of net sales 
excluding the inventory write downs in fiscal  the increase in gross profit dollars was principally due to an increase in unit shipments of our sram products  specifically our k  k  k  and k sram products 
in addition  increases in the average selling prices of our sram products in fiscal compared to fiscal more than offset any increases in product costs resulting in higher gross margins 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal is due to a significant decline in the gross margin for our dram products as a result of declining average selling prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased expenses related to the development of new products and an increase in engineering personnel and payroll related expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily the result of increased payroll related expenses as a result of the addition  prior to the economic slow down  of marketing  sales and administrative personnel 
in addition  selling commissions increased as a result of higher revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased interest income as a result of higher cash balances from the sale of investments and our follow on public stock offering in february gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in the three months ended december   we sold our interest in wafertech to tsmc for approximately million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
on january   icsi completed an initial public offering in taiwan 
as a result of shares of icsi sold by the company in the initial public offering and subsequently  we received gross proceeds of approximately million in fiscal resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in february  we  along with other shareholders  sold a portion of our ownership in nexflash to winbond international corporation for million resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
fiscal includes a pre tax gain of approximately million in the june quarter related to the sale of shares of icsi 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the tax provision for the year ended september  of  includes a benefit of approximately million for the reversal of taxes previously provided for foreign operations no longer deemed necessary as the statute has now expired and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits of approximately million reduced by a valuation allowance 
the tax provision for fiscal is primarily comprised of us federal income taxes 

table of contents equity in net income of affiliated companies 
equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this primarily reflects a decrease in income from our percentage share of icsi s financial results in fiscal from fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
during fiscal  operating activities used cash of approximately million compared to million in fiscal cash used by operations was primarily due to a net loss of million adjusted for an in process technology charge of million  equity in net loss of affiliated companies of million  depreciation of million  other non cash items of million and decreases in accrued expenses of million 
this was partially offset by decreases in inventories of million primarily driven by inventory write downs  increases in accounts payable of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million and decreases in other assets of million 
in fiscal  we generated million from investing activities compared to million used in fiscal in fiscal  we had net sales of available for sale securities of million 
in fiscal  we made additional investments totaling million in smic  a foundry in shanghai  china  and other investments of million  including million in icsi convertible debentures and million in e cmos 
the cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net purchases of available for sale securities of million 
in addition  during fiscal we made investments of million in smic and other investments of million  including million in e cmos 
in fiscal  we generated million from the sale of our investment in wafertech  million from the sale of shares of icsi stock and million from the sale of nexflash shares and received million in dividends from our equity investments 
in fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million for test equipment  engineering tools and computer software 
in addition  we acquired approximately million in fixed assets with the acquisition of purple ray 
we expect to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment during the next twelve months  principally for the purchase of design and engineering tools  additional test equipment and computer software and hardware 
we generated million from financing activities during fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash generated from financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
the primary source of financing for fiscal was proceeds from the issuance of our common stock of million from option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan 
in august  we made a commitment for an equity investment in smic 
in fiscal  we made investments totaling million in smic  bringing our total investment in this foundry as of september   to million 
we have no further commitments to smic for additional equity investments at this time 
we have received certain capacity commitments from smic 
in addition  we have remaining non cancelable purchase commitments to another wafer foundry for approximately million over the next months 
in july  we made a commitment for an equity investment in signia technologies  inc signia  a development stage company focusing on bluetooth design 
at september   our investment in signia was million 
we have committed to invest an additional million in signia  if signia achieves certain milestones with respect to its bluetooth product by january  we lease our facilities including our headquarters in santa clara  california  our field sales offices in the us and europe and sales and engineering offices in asia 
our leases expire at various dates through our outstanding commitments under these leases are approximately million 
on september   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a ruling favorable to issi regarding an april antidumping duty order on imports of srams from taiwan 
subsequently  the antidumping case was terminated  the antidumping order revoked  and our cash deposits were returned during 
table of contents fiscal as a result of the termination of the antidumping case  we reversed amounts previously expensed to cost of goods sold of approximately million of which approximately million had been cash payments and million was in accrued liabilities 
at september   all refunds due to us had been received 
our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years in thousands equipment lease debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations with wafer foundries total contractual cash obligations we believe our existing funds and available financing will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through bank borrowings  equity or debt financings  sales of additional shares of icsi  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our memory expertise and market strategy  including investments in wafer fabrication foundries 
to the extent we pursue such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
certain factors which may affect our business or future operating results our operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate and may not meet published analyst forecasts 
this may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our future quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuations due to a wide variety of factors  including the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  decreases in the demand for our products  excess inventory levels at our customers  declines in average selling prices of our products  cancellation of existing orders or the failure to secure new orders  oversupply of memory products in the market  our failure to introduce new products and to implement technologies on a timely basis  market acceptance of ours and our customers products  economic slowness and low end user demand  our failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  our failure to deliver products to customers on a timely basis  disruption in the supply of wafers or assembly services  changes in product mix  the timing of significant orders  
table of contents increased expenses associated with new product introductions  masks  or process changes  the ability of customers to make payments to us  and the commencement of  or developments with respect to  any future antidumping proceedings 
we have incurred significant losses in certain recent periods  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we have incurred losses in the six consecutive quarters ended september  totaling million 
we expect to incur a loss in the december quarter and may incur losses in subsequent quarters 
we were profitable for fiscal and fiscal our ability to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including our ability to increase our net sales  introduce new products on a timely basis  secure sufficient wafer fabrication capacity and control our operating expenses 
adverse developments with respect to these or other factors could result in quarterly or annual operating losses in the future 
any continued downturn in the markets we serve would harm our business 
substantially all of our products are incorporated into products such as internet access devices  networking equipment  digital consumer products  telecom mobile communications devices  and automotive electronics 
historically  these markets have from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions 
such industry downturns have resulted in reduced product demand and declining average selling prices 
these markets are currently experiencing severely depressed business conditions which are adversely affecting our business 
we are unable to predict how long this current downturn will continue or whether current conditions will worsen 
our sales depend on sram and dram products  and a decline in average selling prices or reduced demand for these products could harm our business 
a majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of sram products  which are subject to unit volume fluctuations and declines in average selling prices which could harm our business 
for example  in the three months ended september   our net sales decreased by to million from million in the three months ended june   principally due to a decline in average selling prices for our products including our sram products 
in addition  in the three months ended june   our net sales decreased by to million from million in the three months ended march   and decreased in the three months ended march  from million in the three months ended december   principally due to a decrease in unit shipments of our sram products as a result of lower demand for electronic products 
while unit shipments of certain sram products increased in the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june   declines in the average selling prices for sram products resulted in an overall decline in sram revenue 
we anticipate further price declines for certain of our sram and dram products in the december quarter 
there can be no assurance that such declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
we may not be able to compensate for price decreases in our products 
competitive pricing pressures due to an industry wide oversupply of wafer capacity as well as product inventory resulted in significant price decreases for our products during fiscal through fiscal while we experienced increases in average selling prices in fiscal  historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined  and we expect that average selling prices will decline in the future 
in this regard  we experienced a decline in the average selling prices for most of our products during fiscal  including the most recent quarter ended september  we anticipate a further decline in the average selling prices for certain of our sram and dram products in the december quarter 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will depend upon our ability to increase unit sales volume of existing 
table of contents products and introduce and sell new products which compensate for the anticipated declines in the average selling prices of our existing products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect our gross margins and profits unless we are able to introduce new products with higher margins or reduce our cost per unit 
we may not be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce our cost per unit 
shifts in industry wide capacity may cause our results to fluctuate 
in the past  such shifts have resulted in significant inventory write downs 
shifts in industry wide capacity from shortages to oversupply or from oversupply to shortages may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is subject to significant downturns resulting from excess capacity  overproduction  reduced demand or technological obsolescence 
these factors can result in a decline in average selling prices and the stated value of inventory 
in fiscal and in fiscal  we recorded inventory write downs of million and million  respectively 
the inventory write downs were predominately for lower of cost or market accounting on our products  and to a lesser extent  excess inventory 
we write down to zero carrying value inventory on hand in excess of six months estimated sales volumes to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made to the forecast based on management s judgments for newer products  end of life products or planned inventory increases 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  management takes into account the product life cycles which can range from to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
we believe that six months is an appropriate period because it is difficult to accurately forecast for a specific product beyond this time frame due to the potential introduction of products by competitors  technology obsolescence or fluctuations in demand 
our policy regarding excess inventory resulted in inventory write downs for excess inventory of approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal year future additional inventory write downs may occur due to lower of cost or market accounting  excess inventory or inventory obsolescence 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  our business will be harmed 
if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers from our current or any alternative sources in a timely manner  our business will be harmed 
to date  our principal manufacturing relationship has been with tsmc  from which we have obtained a majority of our wafers 
we also receive wafers from chartered semiconductor  smic  and umc 
each of our wafer foundries also supplies wafers to other integrated circuit companies  including certain of our competitors 
although we have written commitments specifying wafer capacities from some suppliers  if any suppliers experience manufacturing failures or yield shortfalls  choose to prioritize capacity for other uses  or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us  we may not be able to enforce fulfillment of any delivery commitments 
additionally  we may not be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner and we cannot be certain that other manufacturing sources would agree to deliver an adequate supply of wafers to us 
foundry capacity can be limited and we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our future sales would be adversely impacted 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have entered into and may enter into various arrangements with suppliers  which could include contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  investments in foundries  joint ventures  
table of contents other partnership relationships with foundries  option payments or other prepayments to foundries  or nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments 
we may not be able to make any such arrangements in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a high percentage of our sales  and the loss of a significant customer could cause a decline in our profits 
in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
however  in fiscal  sales to flextronics international accounted for approximately of net sales 
substantially all of our sales to flextronics were for products to be delivered to cisco 
shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of our net sales for fiscal shipments for com directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales for fiscal in fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net sales 
however  in fiscal  shipments for cisco directly  or indirectly through subcontractors  accounted for approximately of net sales 
as sales to these customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and no purchasing contract exists  these customers can cease doing business with us at any time 
in this regard  we experienced order cancellations from these customers in the march quarter which adversely impacted our operating results in subsequent quarters 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
we may not be able to retain our strategic customers  such customers may cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  such orders may not be replaced by other sales 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and such fluctuating sales could harm our business 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects also may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  may divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and could harm our relationships with our customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could lessen market acceptance of our products 
our customers could also seek and obtain damages from us for their losses 
although we specifically limit our liability to replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid  a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
strong competition in the semiconductor memory market may harm our business 
the semiconductor memory market is intensely competitive and has been characterized by an oversupply of product  price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition 
certain of our competitors offer broader product lines and have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than us 
we may not be able to compete successfully against any of these competitors 
our ability to compete successfully in the high performance memory market depends on factors both within and outside of our control  including real or perceived imbalances in supply and demand  product pricing  
table of contents the rate at which oem customers incorporate our products into their systems  the success of our customers products and end user demand  access to advanced process technologies at competitive prices  product functionality  performance and reliability  successful and timely product development  the supply and cost of wafers  achievement of acceptable yields of functional die  the gain or loss of significant customers  and the nature of our competitors and general economic conditions 
in addition  we are vulnerable to technology advances utilized by competitors to manufacture higher performance or lower cost products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future as to any of these factors 
our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business 
potential intellectual property claims and litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
in the semiconductor industry  it is not unusual for companies to receive notices alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  maskwork rights or copyrights owned by third parties 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses may not be offered and the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license under a key patent or intellectual property right from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of the products utilizing the invention or to attempt to develop non infringing products  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
furthermore  we may become involved in protracted litigation regarding the alleged infringement by us of third party intellectual property rights or litigation to assert and protect our patents or other intellectual property rights 
any litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources which could harm our business 
we have significant international sales and risks related to our international operations could harm our operating results 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the united states  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales was attributable to customers located in the united states  was attributable to customers located in europe and was attributable to customers located in asia 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on general economic conditions in asia  europe  and the united states 
in addition  the markets for our products  which are highly cyclical  may not continue to grow 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in europe and asia  particularly in taiwan and the people s republic of china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  
table of contents the burdens of complying with foreign laws  foreign currency fluctuations  difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivable  and political instability 
we have made strategic equity investments in other companies with no assurance that they will increase in value 
over the last few years  we have made several strategic equity investments in other technology companies 
at september   we had investments in equity securities of privately held companies of approximately million  million of which is in smic 
there can be no assurance that these investments will increase in value and there is the possibility that they could decrease in value over time  even to the point of becoming completely worthless 
these investments are tested for impairment on a recurring basis and any reductions in the carrying value would lower our profitability 
in this regard  we recorded approximately  in impairment losses during fiscal we may encounter difficulties in effectively integrating acquired businesses 
from time to time  we may acquire other companies that would be complementary to our business 
acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses related to intangible assets and the possible impairment of goodwill  which could harm our profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things higher than estimated acquisition expenses  difficulties in successfully assimilating the operations  technologies and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees and customers as a result of the acquisition 
in this regard  in february  we acquired purple ray  inc  a privately held research and development stage company developing network search engine and content addressable memory integrated circuits 
pursuant to this transaction  we issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of purple ray and may issue up to an additional  shares upon exercise of warrants and options of purple ray 
approximately  additional shares of our common stock may be issued contingent upon meeting certain milestones 
there can be no assurance as to the effect of the purple ray acquisition or future acquisitions on our business or operating results 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key technical and management personnel 
our success depends upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  including jimmy sm lee  our chairman and chief executive officer  and gary l 
fischer  our president  chief operating officer  and chief financial officer  as well as on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly experienced circuit designers and process engineers 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we have no employment contracts or key person life insurance policies with or for any of our executive officers 
the loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
terrorist attacks  threats of further attacks  threats of war  and acts of war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the september terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers or our customers  may impact our operations and may  among other things  cause delays or losses in the delivery of wafers or other products to us and decreased sales of our products 
more generally  these events have affected  and are expected to continue to affect  the general economy and customer demand for products sold by our customers 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating 
table of contents results  revenues  and costs  which in turn may result in increased volatility in our common stock price and a decline in the price of our common stock 
our stock price is expected to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is expected to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  new or revised earnings estimates  comments or recommendations issued by analysts who follow us  our competitors or the semiconductor industry and other events or factors  aggregate valuations and movement of stocks in the broader semiconductor industry  announcements of new products  strategic relationships or acquisitions by us or our competitors  increases or decreases in wafer capacity  general conditions or cyclicality in the semiconductor industry or the end markets that we serve  governmental regulations  trade laws and import duties  announcements related to future or existing litigation involving us or any of our competitors  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  additions or departures of senior management  and other events or factors many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk includes risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  and korea 
expenses of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency and therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange risk  however  through september  we have not experienced any significant negative impact on our operations as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities and our derivative financial instruments were immaterial at september  we had short term investments of million at september  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without increasing risk 
we invest primarily in high quality  short term debt instruments such as municipal auction rate certificates and instruments issued by high quality financial institutions and companies  including money market instruments 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in interest income 
we own approximately of icsi  a public company listed on the taiwan stock exchange 
we account for this investment on the equity basis and our investment balance as of september  was approximately million 
the market value of our investment in the common stock of icsi at september  was approximately million  based on quoted market prices 
the share price of icsi 
table of contents is subject to fluctuations 
a significant decline in the stock price of icsi may require us to record a loss related to this investment 
in addition  we own approximately million of icsi convertible debentures 
as a result of a decline in the icsi s convertible bond price we recorded an unrealized loss of million related to this investment in the september quarter 
this loss was included in other comprehensive loss in the equity portion of our balance sheet 
further deterioration in icsi s bond price would result in additional losses 
we have investments in equity securities of privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives of approximately million at september   of which million is invested in smic 
these investments are generally in companies in the semiconductor industry 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for using the cost method 
in addition  we have an investment of million that is accounted for on the equity method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and cash flow forecasts for such companies in assessing the net realizable values of the securities of these companies 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
we recorded  in impairment losses during fiscal
