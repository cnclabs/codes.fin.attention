acquisition of penford australia on september   we acquired penford australia for million in cash  plus transaction costs of million 
penford australia is the sole producer of corn starch products in australia and new zealand and is a leader in the research  development and commercialization of novel starch based ingredients 
penford australia manufactures products used to enhance the functionality of food products  as well as products used in the mining and paper industries 
our operations in australia and new zealand include three manufacturing facilities for processing specialty corn starches and wheat products 
the acquisition provided us with opportunities to develop  manufacture and market specialty carbohydrate based ingredient systems for our food  paper and textile customers 
we immediately added a line of food grade corn starch items to our product portfolio 
until the acquisition  our food grade product line consisted primarily of potato based product formulations 
we also expanded our market access  as well as established a regional platform for manufacturing specialty starches for asian and african markets 
these capabilities further enhance penford s ability to 
table of contents commercialize new specialty starches and value added ingredient systems that provide convenient and cost effective solutions for customers made from renewable resources 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the balance of the purchase price was recorded as goodwill 
eleven months of penford australia s results of operations  from the september  date of acquisition  are included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  results of operations while penford is in the business of developing  manufacturing and marketing functional ingredients and previously reported results of operations as a single segment  we increasingly manage the business in three segments 
the first two  industrial ingredients and food ingredients are broad categories of end market users  primarily served by our us operations 
the third segment is our geographically separate operations in australia and new zealand 
our australian and new zealand operations are engaged primarily in the food ingredients business  although the industrial market is an important and growing category there 
therefore  we have expanded our reporting and analysis to present operating results by these three segments  industrial ingredients north america  food ingredients north america and australia new zealand 
fiscal compared to fiscal industrial ingredients business north america year ended august dollars in thousands sales cost of sales gross margin income from operations sales in our industrial business declined in  a result of lower sales volumes trends from that continued into  a negative product mix shift and pricing 
in the latter half of  volumes began to improve as customer demand improved and sales volumes increased slightly over the prior year 
the outlook for the paper making industry  our primary market for our industrial products remains soft 
however  we plan to maintain or improve our market share with increased penetration of existing products and by developing new products targeted to a broader spectrum of the paper making industry 
for example  we have commercialized a new liquid natural additive technology for packaging and paper market segments we have not historically targeted 
our gross margin improved this year to from primarily due to the decline in natural gas prices 
natural gas is the primary energy source for the plants that produce industrial products 
negative product mix shifts and pricing were partly offset by lower prices on other raw materials inputs 
we expect to maintain our gross margins with higher sales volumes in fiscal being offset by increases in energy and chemicals costs 
income from operations improved significantly over fiscal year primarily because of the improvement in gross margin 
sales  administration  and research and development were down in fiscal due to staffing reductions made at the end of 
table of contents food ingredients business north america year ended august dollars in thousands sales cost of sales gross margin income from operations sales increased over fiscal we experienced an increase in sales to a new global food service customer  primarily for french fry coatings 
the contract  implemented part way through fiscal  was in place for a full year for however  sales to other french fry coatings customers declined  largely offsetting the positive impact of the new contract 
we expect french fry coatings  over half of our business in to become a smaller relative part of our business as we further commercialize technologies for new products 
we also added production capability for food grade corn starches in north america  which will diversify our product offerings throughout the region 
our gross margin did not change significantly from the benefit realized from a decline in natural gas prices was offset by increases in other manufacturing costs 
as a result  income from operations was comparable to the prior year 
australia new zealand operations year ended august dollars in thousands sales cost of sales gross margin income from operations reported sales increased in this is due primarily to the inclusion of only eleven months of operations in versus a full year for because of the september  acquisition date 
proforma sales assuming twelve months of were comparable to volumes increased  offsetting the impact on reported sales of an unfavorable product mix shift 
volumes decreased in two of our most profitable products in while increasing in several lower margin products 
a program was initiated at penford australia in to focus marketing projects on higher value added products and to improve profitability 
our margins deteriorated in because wheat prices increased due to high export demand resulting from the weak australian dollar 
additionally  corn costs increased in new zealand due to stronger demand for feed grains in the dairy industry 
the product mix shift also impacted margins 
income from operations improved as lower selling  administration  research and development costs totaling approximately million offset the foregoing factors 
the reduction in expenses resulted from our adoption of sfas effective the beginning of fiscal which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
goodwill amortization expense was million in in addition  we reduced staff at the end of  and the cost of those staff reductions of million were recognized in corporate overhead  interest  taxes and other corporate overhead expenses increased to million from million in this is due primarily to the million cost of a strategic restructuring announced in january  primarily for severance and lease termination costs 
we also incurred million of incremental transition expenses related to the strategic restructuring that do not qualify for inclusion in the restructure charge that are primarily for the costs of hiring new corporate staff and transition personnel costs 
in  we recorded a million charge incurred in connection with terminated joint venture discussions 

table of contents in  we also recorded a non operating charge of million related to the complete write off of a investment in an early stage technology company 
interest expense was million in compared to million in this was due to lower market interest rates in the us as well as lower average debt balances than in our effective tax rate for was lower than the overall statutory rate of due to the benefits of our foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
our effective rate for was higher than our statutory rates due to state taxes and nondeductible goodwill amortization 
fiscal compared to fiscal industrial ingredients business north america year ended august dollars in thousands sales cost of sales gross margin income from operations sales declined in primarily due to lower product shipments to our customers in the paper industry  which was suffering from import competition and decreased demand for their products in the general economic slowdown 
we also saw a decline in our average sales price resulting from a product mix shift and pricing 
the primary factor in our gross margin decline was the increase in natural gas prices in lower production volumes  the negative product mix shift and pricing concessions also contributed to the decline 
as a result of the foregoing  our income from operations decreased 
operating expenses decreased by million  including a million charge related to a staffing reduction in the fourth quarter of food ingredients business north america year ended august dollars in thousands sales cost of sales gross margin income from operations sales increased in primarily due to the addition of a new global food service customer  as well as the success of several new products in various food industry market segments 
our gross margin declined primarily due to the increase in natural gas prices  offset in part by lower manufacturing costs achieved on higher production volumes 
income from operations increased over due to increased sales 
operating expenses increased to provide the cost of infrastructure needed to support increased business activity 
australia new zealand operations we acquired penford australia subsequent to fiscal the pro forma impact of the acquisition is presented in note b to the consolidated financials 

table of contents corporate overhead  interest  taxes and other corporate overhead increased to million from million in operating expenses for included a million charge for terminated joint venture discussions 
expenses also increased for corporate wide employee benefit programs  insurance and professional fees 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was attributed to higher debt balances as a result of the acquisition of penford australia 
our effective interest rate in fiscal was consistent with the prior year 
the effective tax rate in fiscal varied from statutory rates primarily due to higher state taxes and the non deductible nature of the goodwill amortization related to the penford australia acquisition 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we paid our private placement debt facilities early in connection with a comprehensive refinancing to fund the acquisition of penford australia 
the early repayment of the private placements required prepayment fees  which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  which is presented as an extraordinary loss of million  which is net of the related tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources at august   penford had working capital of million and million outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and inventory financing credit agreement 
we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to reduce our outstanding debt and do not expect to increase borrowings in the normal course of operations during the year  except for seasonal borrowings related to grain purchasing for our australian operations  generally in our third fiscal quarter 
discussion of unused capacity on our revolving credit facilities follows below 
cash flow from operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in over is due primarily to favorable changes in working capital and improved profitability 
in addition to normal operating expenses  we will use cash generated from operations to fund the payment of million of accrued strategic restructuring costs 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal were primarily for improvements at the company s facility in cedar rapids  iowa  including an investment in plant capability that allows us to manufacture food grade products from corn and improve asset utilization 
over the past two years  due to the current operating environment and significant investments made in the prior two years  we reduced capital expenditures from previous levels 
we expect that in the next fiscal year  our capital investments are not expected to exceed levels 
this will consist of efficiency improvements at our cedar rapids facility  as well as at our other north american  australian and new zealand operations 
we continue to make efficiency and safety improvements as required to maintain our operations in good working order 
on september   we acquired operations in australia and new zealand for million  which we financed through additional borrowings 
on november   our banks approved an amendment to our credit agreements to modify the leverage ratio and to reduce scheduled term loan payments in in connection with this modification  we paid a fee of approximately million 
we made term loan payments totaling million during fiscal for fiscal  our banks have approved a revised loan amortization schedule  which reduces our scheduled term loan payments to million 
we are required to reduce our term loans by an additional million in fiscal under prepayment clauses of our credit agreement 
we are also required to use proceeds of million from the national starch transaction to repay our term loans 

table of contents under the amended financial covenants of our credit agreements  we are required over the coming fiscal quarters to improve our leverage ratio the ratio of our debt balance to the trailing four quarters of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
although we have significantly improved earnings and reduced our borrowings over the past year  we have limited ability to borrow on available capacity under our existing credit lines until we improve our leverage ratio 
however  as mentioned previously  we do not expect to increase our borrowings  other than seasonal borrowing related to grain purchasing from our australian operations in the third quarter of next year 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient borrowing capacity and availability on our credit lines to fund those seasonal grain purchases 
our financial covenants also restrict new indebtedness  require maintenance of minimum tangible net worth and limit annual capital expenditures to million 
in addition to the leverage ratio  we are also required to maintain interest coverage and fixed charges coverage ratios 
fixed charges include scheduled principal repayments  interest  rent  taxes  dividends and capital expenditures 
if earnings fall below projected levels  we could be required to limit capital expenditures and or dividends 
penford australia uses an inventory financing credit agreement to purchase corn at harvest in australia for production requirements for the following year 
in fiscal  that purchasing activity increased to provide some of the input requirements for our operations in new zealand to ensure adequate supply and to minimize exposure to the higher local prices in new zealand due to increased demand for corn by the dairy feed industry 
in fiscal  our financial activities revolved primarily around refinancing and additional borrowings for the acquisition of penford australia 
in fiscal  we paid dividends of million to our shareholders at a quarterly rate of per share 
the board of directors reviews the dividend policy on a periodic basis  and we have included the continuation of quarterly dividends in our planning for fiscal the board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to  shares of penford s outstanding common stock 
repurchases under the program to date have totaled  shares for million in prior years 
we did not purchase any of our common stock during fiscal or  and do not expect to do so in fiscal effects of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on penford s revenue and income from operations the past three years 
inflation is not expected to have a material impact in fiscal critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions to fairly present results of operations and financial position 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time this report was prepared 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and the actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is significantly dictated by generally accepted accounting principles and does not require judgment or estimates 
there are also areas in which management s judgments in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our chief financial officer has reviewed our accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain a summary of our accounting policies 
however  the accounting policies that we believe are the most important to our financial statements and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments include the following 
table of contents evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans valuation of goodwill a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we make judgments about our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables that we may not be able to collect 
we record our estimate of accounts that we will not be able to collect based upon a specific review of our larger accounts that make up approximately of our accounts receivable 
for those accounts not specifically reviewed  we estimate uncollectible amounts based on the age of the receivable compared to the terms offered 
if our estimates do not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding invoices  we may experience losses in excess of the reserves we have established 
at august  and our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was  and  respectively 
the majority of our allowance is related to our industrial ingredients business  and reflects the difficult economics in the paper making industry 
hedging activities we use derivatives  primarily futures contacts  to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in our manufacturing processes in the united states 
we have elected to designate these activities as hedges 
this election allows us to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying commodity is used in the production process 
the requirements for our designation of hedges are very complex  and require judgments and analysis to qualify as hedges as defined by sfas these judgments and analysis include an assessment that the derivative instruments we use are effective hedges of the underlying risks 
if we were to fail to meet the requirements of sfas  or if we do not designate these derivative instruments as hedges  we would be required to mark these contracts to market at each reporting date 
we had deferred gains of  and  at august  and  respectively  which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in both years 
benefit plans penford has stock option plans for its employees and directors 
because we grant options to employees at the market price on date of grant  we follow the policy of recording no compensation expense for those option grants 
an alternative financial reporting standard  sfas  provides a methodology for estimating the hypothetical compensation expense associated with stock option grants  which expense is then amortized over the vesting period 
as required by sfas  we have disclosed the pro forma impact of this alternative accounting treatment in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
penford has defined benefit plans for its employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care 
qualified actuaries determine the estimated cost of these plans annually 
these actuarial estimates are based on assumptions of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future payments  the expected investment return on plan assets  the estimate of future increases in compensation rates and the estimate of increases in the cost of medical care 
we make judgments about these assumptions based on our historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends 
however  if these assumptions are wrong  it could materially affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note h to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents valuation of goodwill we are required to assess whether the value of goodwill reported on our balance sheet has been impaired on an annual basis  or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be an impairment 
these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill 
while we engage qualified valuation experts to assist in this process  their work is based on our estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to our business units 
if future operating results differ materially from our estimates  the value of goodwill could be adversely impacted 
new accounting pronouncements effective september   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
established new standards related to how acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are to be recorded upon their acquisition as well as how they are to be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
effective with the adoption of this standard  penford is no longer amortizing goodwill 
we have completed the required transitional impairment test at september   as well as the annual update as of june  and determined there was no impairment to the recorded value of goodwill 
penford uses a fair value approach  using primarily discounted cash flows  to complete the impairment tests 
on a prospective basis  we are required to continue to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
in april  fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  this statement rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
we adopted sfas no 
on september   and will be required to apply the new rules for these transactions in the future 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for cost associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions penford is exposed to market risks that are inherent in the financial instruments that we use in the normal course of business 
we may use various hedge instruments to manage or reduce market risk  but we do not use derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
our primary market risks are discussed below 
long term debt all of penford s long term debt has variable interest rates  which are set for periods of one to six months 
we have managed interest rates using interest rate swaps in the past  but there are no such instruments outstanding as of august  the carrying value of our variable rate long term debt as of august  of million was approximately equal to the fair value 
our market risk has been calculated as the possible increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one point change in interest rates 
the market risk associated with a one point change in interest rates at august  and  is approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates we have us australian and australian new zealand dollar currency exchange rate risks due to revenues and costs denominated in australian and new zealand dollars with our foreign operation  penford australia 
currently  cash generated by penford australia s operations is used for capital investment in australia and payment of debt denominated in australian dollars 
at august   approximately of our total debt was denominated in australian dollars 
because of the natural hedge created by our australian borrowings  we have not maintained any derivative instruments to further mitigate our us australian dollar currency exchange translation exposure 
this position is reviewed periodically  and based on our review  may result in the incorporation of derivative instruments in our hedging strategy 
our currency exchange rate risk between our australian and new zealand operations is not significant 
the impact of a change in the foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar would not have a significant impact on reported net income for the year ended august  from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to receivables denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the selling entities 
as of august   we did not have any foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 
at that date  we had trade receivables of us million at penford australia 
commodities the availability and price of corn  penford s most significant raw material  is subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  domestic and foreign governmental farm programs and policies  changes in global demand and the worldwide production of corn 
to reduce the price risk caused by market fluctuations  we generally follow a policy of using exchange traded futures and options contracts to hedge our exposure to corn price fluctuations in north america 
these futures and options contracts are designated as hedges 
the changes in market value of these contracts have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  highly effective in offsetting the price changes in corn 
penford s net corn position in the us consists primarily of inventories  purchase contracts and exchange traded futures and options contracts that hedge penford s exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
the fair value of the position is based on quoted market prices 
we have estimated our market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
as of august  and  the fair value of our net corn position was approximately million and million  respectively 
the market risk associated with a adverse change in corn prices at august  and  is estimated at  and  respectively 
over the past two years  prices for natural gas have increased over historic levels 
prices for natural gas fluctuate due to anticipated changes in supply and demand and movement of prices of related or alternative fuels 
to reduce the price risk caused by market fluctuations  we generally enter into short term purchase contracts or use exchange traded futures and options contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
these futures and options contracts are designated as hedges 
the changes in market value of these contracts have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  highly effective in offsetting the price changes in natural gas 
penford s exchange traded futures and options contracts hedge production requirements 
the fair value of these contracts is based on quoted market prices 
we have estimated our market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
as of august   the fair value of our natural gas contracts was a loss of approximately million 
the market risk associated with a adverse change in natural gas prices at august  is estimated at  we did not have any natural gas derivatives positions at august
