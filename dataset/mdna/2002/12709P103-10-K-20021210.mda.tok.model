all statements other than statements of historical fact we make in this form k are forward looking 
in particular  the statements herein regarding industry or general economic prospects or trends  our future results of operations or financial position and statements preceded by  followed by or that include the words intends  estimates  plans  believes  expects  anticipates  should  could  or similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect our current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
our actual results may differ significantly from our expectations 
we assume no obligation to update this forward looking information 
the section entitled factors affecting future operating results describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements which are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview we believe we are the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of the most advanced ic devices within a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are built upon silicon wafers  and it is a necessary step in the production of advanced ics 
planarization is a polishing process that levels and smooths  removing excess material from the surfaces of these layers 
cmp slurries are liquid formulations that facilitate and enhance this polishing process and generally contain engineered abrasives and proprietary chemicals 
cmp enables ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we believe cmp will become increasingly important in the future as manufacturers seek to shrink the size of these devices and to improve their performance 
a majority of our cmp slurries are used to polish insulating layers and the tungsten plugs that go through the insulating layers and connect the multiple wiring layers of ic devices 
we have developed specialized slurries used to polish copper  a metal used in wiring layers of ic device fabrication  and our products for this application have been well received 
in addition  we have developed cmp slurries for polishing several components in hard disk drives  specifically rigid disk substrates and magnetic heads  and we have become a strong participant in this market 
we are continuing to develop slurries for new applications such as direct shallow trench isolation and noble metals 
in addition  we are developing our own polishing pads for use in the cmp process 
like slurries  polishing pads are important consumables used in the cmp process 
to broaden our portfolio of pad products  we recently entered into a distribution agreement with a third party to sell polishing pads while pursuing additional elements of our pad strategy 
prior to our initial public offering on april   we operated as a division of cabot corporation  a global chemical manufacturing company based in boston  massachusetts 
following our initial public offering  cabot corporation owned approximately percent of cabot microelectronics 
on september   cabot corporation effected the spin off of cabot microelectronics by distributing shares of our common stock as a dividend on each outstanding share of cabot corporation common stock outstanding on september   or an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
basis of presentation the following management s discussion of results of operations contains financial comparisons with prior periods that are affected by certain agreements entered into with cabot corporation during the fiscal year ended september  the effects of these agreements on the comparison of operating results are disclosed in the discussion that follows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventory valuation  impairments of tangible and intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  other accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product returns based upon historical experience and any known conditions or circumstances 
our warranty obligation is affected primarily by product that does not meet specifications and performance requirements and any related costs of addressing such matters 
should actual incidences of product not meeting specifications and performance requirements differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventory written off and for known conditions and circumstances 
should actual product marketability be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
also  the purchase cost of one of our key raw materials from one supplier changes significantly based on the total quantity of in specification product purchased in a given fiscal year 
during interim periods we determine inventory valuation and the amount charged to cost of goods sold for this raw material from this supplier based on the expected average cost over the entire fiscal year using our current full year forecast of purchases of this raw material from this supplier 
we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our material agreements and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to account for stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
we disclose the summary of pro forma effects to reported net income as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of stock based awards to employees of cabot microelectronics as prescribed by sfas results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september total revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation settlement amortization of intangibles operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue total revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to a increase in volume and million was due to increased weighted average selling prices 
revenue related to copper products increased over the prior year 
fiscal revenue would have been million higher had the japanese yen average exchange rate for the year held constant with the prior year average 
total revenue in the second half of fiscal increased over the first half of the year 
we believe this is primarily due to higher production by our customers as a result of improvement in ic device inventories  which appeared to return to more normal levels during however  we have not yet seen an improvement in demand driven by end markets  as a lack of corporate information technology spending appears to have weighed heavily on the pc and computer related markets 
we also experienced an increase in competition this fiscal year and expect it to continue to intensify 
the continued uncertainty in the semiconductor industry and the worldwide economy make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of or million from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume and million was due to higher weighted average costs per gallon 
with respect to the key raw materials used to make our products  we expect that the cost of fumed silica we purchase from cabot corporation used in the manufacture of cmp slurries will continue to increase according to the terms of our existing fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation  which provides for a fixed annual increase in the price of silica of of the initial price and additional increases if cabot corporation s raw material costs increase 
also  in order to meet certain of our needs for fumed alumina given the anticipated growth in sales of fumed alumina based slurries  in december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation and an amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to its fumed alumina terms 
under this fumed alumina supply agreement  cabot corporation expanded its capacity for the manufacture of fumed alumina and we have the first right to all this capacity 
the agreement provides that the price cabot corporation charges us for fumed alumina is based on all of its fixed and variable costs for producing the fumed alumina  plus its capital costs for expanding its capacity  plus an agreed upon rate of return on investment  plus incentive payments if they produce more than a certain amount that meets our specifications per year 
the terms of this agreement  along with those contained in the amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement  were retroactive to october and our average cost per pound for alumina from cabot corporation since that time is higher than paid previously under the original fumed metal oxide agreement 
had we paid this higher average cost per pound for all fumed alumina purchased in fiscal  cost of goods sold in that period would have increased by approximately million 
certain costs will decrease in the future due to the expiration on june  of a contingent payment arrangement resulting from our acquisition of selected assets used or created in connection with the development and sale of polishing slurries 
we had made payments under this agreement of of applicable slurry revenue from july  through our last payment in august  cost of goods sold for the quarter ended september  included a final payment of million  which now completely terminates our obligation under this contract 
our need for additional quantities of key raw materials in the future has required and will continue to require that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
in july  we entered into an agreement for certain materials with a supplier in which we are obligated to purchase  subject to the supplier s ability to deliver  certain minimum quantities based upon certain forecasted requirements over a one year period 
we do not expect this agreement to have a material effect on our cost of goods sold 
however  we may enter into arrangements in the future that could result in costs which are higher than those in the existing agreements gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in fixed manufacturing costs offset partially by an increase in weighted average selling prices 
research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from research and development expense increased million due to increased staffing  million due to higher wafer purchases and million due to depreciation and operating costs of our new r d facility 
an additional million increase resulted from allocating certain common facility operating costs to r d 
these costs had previously been treated as general and administrative expense prior to the r d facility addition to our existing office building 
key activities during the year involved the continued development of new and enhanced slurry products  with a significant focus on slurries for polishing copper  and new cmp polishing pad technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase was primarily due to increased staffing in north america 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from the decrease was primarily due to the absence of million of stock compensation and other costs associated with an executive leaving the business in fiscal  a net decrease in non cash charges related to modifications of stock option agreements of million  reduced relocation and recruiting costs of million  decrease in professional fees of million  decrease in facilities charges of million due to the change in allocation of certain common facility operating costs described under research and development and a net decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of million 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in depreciation of million associated with administrative areas of the r d facility addition 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase due to higher premiums and increased coverage with respect to directors and officers liability insurance 
litigation settlement during the second fiscal quarter of  we settled all pending patent infringement litigation with rodel  which resulted in a one time payment of million 
under the settlement agreement  we received a fully paid up  worldwide royalty free license to all technology that was the subject of the litigation and their foreign equivalents  and we have no further financial obligation with respect to this matter 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in the reduction of approximately million occurred as we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october   which required the amortization of goodwill to be discontinued and that goodwill be instead tested for impairment at least annually 
other income  net other income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of approximately million was primarily due to million of interest expense from capital leases entered into during the current fiscal year  a payment of million to cabot corporation to reimburse them for certain capital improvements made to equipment used to supply us with material that was abandoned and the absence of million interest income on accounts receivable balances 
these decreases were almost entirely offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains resulting from the strengthening of the japanese yen and increased interest income due to higher cash balances over the prior year 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly due to an increase in tax credits from expanded research and experimentation activities 
net income net income was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue total revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to a increase in volume and million was due to increased weighted average selling prices 
fiscal revenue would have been million higher had the japanese yen average exchange rate for the year held constant with the prior fiscal year average 
total revenue in would have been million lower had our dispersion services agreement with cabot corporation been in effect throughout the entire fiscal year 
most of our revenues are derived from sales of products used in the manufacture of advanced ic devices 
manufacturing of ic devices declined throughout calendar year as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry and weak global economic conditions 
as a result  our fiscal quarterly revenues were the highest in our first quarter at million and were the lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter at million  which was essentially flat with revenues in the third fiscal quarter 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of or million from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume and million was due to higher weighted average costs per gallon 
cost of goods sold would have been million higher in had our dispersion services and fumed metal oxide agreements with cabot corporation been in effect throughout the entire fiscal year 
higher costs per gallon resulted from a shift in product mix and higher raw material costs 
had the fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation  which was entered into in december  been in effect during the year ended september   cost of goods sold for that period would have increased by approximately million 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue of in was essentially flat as compared to in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue would have been in had our dispersion services and fumed metal oxide agreements with cabot corporation been in effect throughout the entire fiscal year 
on a comparable basis  the increase in gross profit of percentage points resulted primarily from favorable product mix 
research and development research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over this resulted primarily from higher staffing levels and operating supplies needed to support our continued investments in research and development 
key activities during the twelve months ended september  involved the continued development of new and enhanced slurry products with a significant focus on slurries for polishing copper  cmp polishing pad technology and advanced particle technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase was due primarily to the hiring of additional customer support personnel in north america  japan and taiwan 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal includes compensation expense of million related to options granted to non cabot microelectronics employees at the time of the initial public offering and a charge for the accelerated vesting of long term incentives and benefits at the time of the spin off from cabot corporation 
absent these prior year charges  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  primarily due to increased staffing and other expenses necessary to support the general growth of the business and the administrative activities of a stand alone company 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and resulting from goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition of selected distributor assets from a third party in provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly driven by an increase in tax credits from expanded research and experimentation activities 
net income net income was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in  million in and million in our cash provided by operating activities in resulted from net income of million plus non cash items of million which was offset partially by a net increase in working capital of million 
the increase in working capital resulted primarily from an increase in inventories and prepaid and other assets which were partially offset by increases in income taxes payable 
our principal funding requirements have been for additions to property  plant and equipment that support the expansion of our business and technological capability 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily due to the construction and completion of our new research and development facility in aurora  illinois  and equipping the facility with additional research and development equipment 
we also purchased additional production related equipment to be used in aurora  illinois and invested in the development and implementation of our stand alone business information system 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily related to the capacity expansion of our geino  japan facility and construction of our new aurora  illinois research and development facility 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily related to the construction of our aurora  illinois manufacturing facility  the purchase of land and construction of a new distribution facility in korea  the purchase of research and development equipment and the purchase of additional land in geino  japan 
we had cash flows from financing activities of million in which resulted from the issuance of common stock of million for both the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  offset partially by principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
in cash flows from financing activities of million resulted from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  cash flows from financing activities of million resulted primarily from capital contributions from cabot corporation of million  net proceeds from our initial public offering of million and borrowings of million under a term credit facility 
we paid cabot corporation dividends of million in march and million in april also  during the third quarter of  we repaid million of borrowings under our term credit facility 
at september  debt was comprised of an unsecured term loan in the amount of million funded on the basis of the illinois state treasurer s economic program 
this loan is due on april  and incurs interest at an annual rate of 
on july   the agreement between cabot microelectronics and lasalle bank for this loan was amended and restated 
although the loan amount of million was unchanged  various other terms were revised and the termination date was amended from june  to april  on july  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility with a group of commercial banks which replaced our million unsecured revolving credit facility and million revolving line of credit  both of which were terminated 
on february   this agreement was amended with no material changes in terms 
under this agreement  which terminates july   interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
a non use fee also accrues 
loans under this facility are anticipated to be used primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding or were outstanding at september  under this credit facility and we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal year will be approximately million  approximately million of which we have already spent as of october  our major capital expenditures in are currently expected to be approximately million for advanced clean room equipment  polishing and other equipment primarily for use in our new research and development facility  and approximately million for general expansion of operations and new business support 
as our business needs in south korea have changed  in november we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell our distribution center and land in ansung  south korea 
the sale is pending and estimated final proceeds approximate the net book value of the assets being sold 
we believe that cash generated by our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and expected capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology and  to do so  we may be required to raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after total year years years years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations long term debt at september  debt was comprised of an unsecured term loan in the amount of million funded under the illinois state treasurer s economic program 
the interest rate is and the loan is due april  capital lease obligations on december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation 
under this agreement  cabot corporation expanded its capacity in tuscola  illinois for the manufacture of fumed alumina 
payments by us for capital costs for the facility have been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments of approximately million resulted in a million lease obligation and related leased asset 
the agreement has an initial five year term  which expires in  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which would expire in we also can choose not to renew the agreement subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs  after the initial five year term 
capital lease payments to cabot corporation commenced in the second quarter of fiscal and a total of million has been paid as of september  on january  we entered into a cmp tool and polishing consumables transfer agreement with a third party under which we agreed to transfer polishing consumables to them in return for a cmp polishing tool 
the polishing tool has been treated as a capital lease and the aggregate fair market value of the polishing consumables resulted in a million lease obligation 
the agreement has approximately a three year term  which expires in november operating leases we lease certain vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  machinery and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases  most of which expire within ten years and may be renewed by us 
unconditional purchase obligations unconditional purchase obligations include our noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we operate under an amended fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation for the purchase of two key raw materials  fumed silica and fumed alumina 
we are obligated to purchase at least of our six month volume forecast of fumed silica and must pay the difference if we purchase less than that amount 
we currently anticipate meeting minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
also  under our fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation we are obligated to pay certain fixed  capital and variable costs through december of this agreement has an initial five year term  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which would expire in december if we do not renew the agreement  we will become subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs 
unconditional purchase obligations include million of contractual commitments based upon our anticipated renewal of the agreement through december unconditional purchase obligations also includes million related to a purchase agreement entered into with a supplier in july for certain materials in which we are obligated to purchase  subject to the supplier s ability to deliver  certain minimum quantities based upon certain forecasted requirements over a one year period 
we currently anticipate meeting minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
we also have a long term agreement with a supplier to purchase materials for use in one of our product lines that is not currently in commercial production 
as of september   we are obligated to purchase  subject to the supplier s ability to deliver  million of materials over the remaining term of the agreement  which expires in june  there exists the possibility that we will not require the entire amount of material provided for under the agreement  but we still would be obligated to pay for it 
we have not recorded a liability for this possible loss as we plan to and are evaluating the use of the production capabilities of this supplier in conjunction with this product line strategy 
in fiscal and  we made payments to this supplier of million and million  respectively for purchasing less than the contractual minimum 
we also are required to reimburse the supplier for all approved research and development costs related to the materials 
the supplier will repay these research and development reimbursements if our material purchases from them reach certain levels 
in november  we entered into a purchase agreement for certain materials with a supplier and we are obligated to purchase million over the life of the contract 
we also expect to purchase million of capital assets to be placed in service at this supplier 
other long term obligations we have an agreement with davies imperial coatings  inc davies pursuant to which davies will perform certain agreed upon dispersion services 
we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of services per year and to invest approximately million per year in capital improvements or other expenditures to maintain capacity at the davies dispersion facility 
the initial term of the agreement expires in october  with automatic one year renewals  and contains a day cancellation clause executable by either party 
we are obligated to make a termination payment if the agreement is not renewed 
on july  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit and term facility with a group of commercial banks 
under this agreement  which terminates july   we are obligated to pay an administrative fee and a non use fee 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this agreement and we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
on september  we entered into a licensing agreement for a product line under development 
under this agreement we are required to pay an annual non refundable minimum annual licensing fee 
in addition  we have committed to rent or purchase equipment to develop and commercialize the licensed product 
this agreement is cancelable at any time and shall remain in effect until terminated upon the mutual agreement of the parties involved

we intend to post on our website any material changes to  or waiver from our code of business conduct  if any  within two days of any such event 
factors affecting future operating results risks relating to our business we have a narrow product range and our products may become obsolete  or technological changes may reduce or limit increases in cmp consumption our business is substantially dependent on a single class of products  cmp slurries  which historically has accounted for almost all of our revenue 
our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased 
our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry and to adapt and improve our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends 
since its inception  the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid technological changes and advances in the design  manufacture  performance and application of ic devices and these changes and advances are expected to continue in the future 
one or more developments in the semiconductor or related industries may render our products obsolete or less important to the ic device manufacturing process 
a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of large customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers 
one or more of these principal customers may stop buying cmp slurries from us or may substantially reduce the quantity of cmp slurries they purchase from us 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in cmp slurries sold to these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal year  our five largest customers  of which two are distributors  accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech  one of these distributors  and intel accounting for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
in fiscal year  our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech and intel accounting for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
demand for our products and our business may be adversely affected by a further decline in worldwide economic and industry conditions our business is affected by current economic and industry trends and it is extremely difficult to predict sales of our products given uncertainties in these factors 
during fiscal and the first and second fiscal quarters of the global economic slowdown and weakening in demand for electronic systems  coupled with higher than normal chip inventories  affected our quarterly revenue trends 
although our third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year showed improvement over previous quarters  concerns remain regarding the health of the global economy and semiconductor industry and further declines or lack of improvement in current economic and industry conditions could adversely affect our business 
any problem or interruption in our supply from cabot corporation or other suppliers of our most important raw materials  including fumed metal oxides  could delay our slurry production and adversely affect our sales fumed metal oxides  both fumed silica and fumed alumina  are the primary raw materials we use in many of our cmp slurries 
our business would suffer from any problem or interruption in our supply of fumed metal oxides or other key raw materials 
we entered into a fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation  which became effective upon completion of our initial public offering in april  in december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation and an amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to fumed alumina 
under these agreements  cabot corporation continues to be our primary supplier of certain fumed metal oxides for our slurry products produced as of the date of the initial public offering with respect to fumed silica and as of the effective date of the new fumed alumina supply agreement with respect to certain amounts of fumed alumina 
under the fumed alumina supply agreement  cabot corporation expanded its capacity for the manufacture of fumed alumina to which we have first right to all capacity from the expansion and  under the amended fumed metal oxide agreement  we now have first right  subject to certain terms and conditions  to the fumed alumina capacity from that facility 
we face the risk of significant increases in the price of fumed metal oxides under these agreements if cabot corporation s cost of production increases 
it may be difficult to secure alternative sources of fumed metal oxides in the event cabot corporation or another supplier is unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of fumed metal oxides which meet the quality required by our customers supply needs and technical specifications  or encounters supply problems  including but not limited to any related to quality  functionality of equipment  natural disasters  work stoppages or raw material availability 
in addition  contractual amendments to the existing agreements with  or non performance by  cabot corporation or another supplier  may adversely affect us as well 
in addition  if we change the supplier or type of key raw materials such as fumed metal oxides we use to make our existing cmp slurries or are required to purchase them from a different manufacturer or manufacturing facility  whether cabot corporation or another party  in certain circumstances our customers are forced to requalify our cmp slurries for their manufacturing processes and products 
the requalification process takes a significant amount of time to complete  possibly interrupting or reducing our sales of cmp slurries to these customers 
we have also specifically engineered our slurry chemistries with key raw materials such as fumed metal oxides 
a change in the fumed metal oxides or other key raw materials we use to make our slurry products could require us to modify our products 
this modification may involve a significant amount of time and cost to complete and could require our customers to requalify our products  and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business and sales 
our business could be seriously harmed if our existing or future competitors develop superior slurry products  offer better pricing terms or service  obtain certain intellectual property rights or if any of our major customers develop in house slurry manufacturing capability competition has intensified in the past year  and increased competition from current cmp slurry manufacturers  new entrants to the cmp slurry market or a decision by any of our major customers to produce slurry products in house could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
competition has increased from other existing providers of cmp slurries and opportunities exist for other companies with sufficient financial or technological resources to emerge as potential competitors by developing their own cmp slurry products 
some of our major customers  and some potential customers  currently manufacture slurries in house and others have the financial and technological capability to do so 
the existence or threat of increased competition and in house production could limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for our slurry products 
in addition  our competitors may have or obtain intellectual property rights which may restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
because we have limited experience in manufacturing and selling cmp polishing pads  expansion of our business into this area may not be successful an element of our strategy is to leverage our current customer relationships and technological expertise to expand our business into new product areas and applications  including manufacturing cmp polishing pads 
we have had limited experience in developing and marketing these products  which involve technologies and production processes that are relatively new to us 
we  the suppliers of the raw materials that we use to develop our polishing pads  or the provider of pads for whom we act as distributor  may not be able to solve any technological or production problems that we or they may encounter 
in addition  if we  our suppliers or pad provider are unable to keep pace with technological or other developments in the design and production of polishing pads  we will probably not be competitive in the polishing pad market 
in addition  our competitors may have or obtain intellectual property rights which may restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
for these reasons  the expansion of our business into cmp polishing pads may not be successful 
because we rely heavily on our intellectual property  our failure to adequately protect or obtain it could seriously harm our business protection of intellectual property is particularly important in our industry because cmp slurry and pad manufacturers develop complex and technical formulas for cmp products which are proprietary in nature and differentiate their products from those of competitors 
our intellectual property is important to our success and ability to compete 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as employee and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could seriously harm our business 
policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and the steps we have taken may not detect or prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies 
in addition  other parties may independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies to ours 
we are subject to some risks associated with our foreign operations we currently have operations and a large customer base outside the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside the united states 
we encounter risks in doing business in foreign countries 
these risks include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in economic and political conditions  as well as the difficulty in enforceability of business and customer contracts and agreements  including protection of intellectual property rights 
we have announced our intention to sell directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia beginning in june  we currently service these customers through metron  a third party distributor 
selling directly may increase our risk of conducting business in foreign countries 
our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and this may limit our ability to expand our business and improve our technology we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology 
this may require funds in excess of those generated from operating activities and from those available under existing credit facilities 
therefore  we may be required to raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
historical financial information prior to fiscal may not be representative of our results as a separate company the historical financial information we have presented may not reflect what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity for fiscal years prior to and may not be indicative of what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be in the future 
as a result  information to evaluate our business is limited 
this is because when we were a division of cabot corporation  cabot corporation provided us with various services and allocated expenses for these services to us in amounts that may not have been the same as the expenses we would have incurred had we performed or acquired these services ourselves 
at the time of our initial public offering  we changed our fumed metal oxide supply and dispersion services arrangements with cabot corporation and the prices we are paying and anticipate paying in the future under these and other arrangements 
in december we entered into an amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement and a new agreement for the purchase of fumed alumina 
also  the historical financial information for the periods prior to our initial public offering does not reflect other events and changes that have occurred as a result of our separation from cabot corporation  including the establishment of our capital structure  the incurrence of debt and changes in our expenses as a result of new employee  tax and other structures and matters 
risks relating to our separation from cabot corporation certain of our directors or executive officers may have conflicts of interest because they also own cabot corporation stock three former members of our board of directors were directors and or executive officers of cabot corporation during their term of service on our board 
one former director resigned from our board in july  one did not stand for reelection and his term of service expired at our annual meeting held in march   and one resigned in april  during their term on our board  these former directors had obligations to both companies and may have had conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us  such as acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may have been suitable for both us and cabot corporation  as well as related party transactions and agreements between us and cabot corporation such as our fumed metal oxide  fumed alumina supply  and dispersion services agreements 
in addition  some of our executive officers own cabot corporation stock that they acquired as employees of cabot corporation  and some directors own cabot corporation stock that they acquired independently 
this ownership could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and cabot corporation 
we may have conflicts with cabot corporation with respect to our past and ongoing relationships conflicts of interest may arise between cabot corporation and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships 
we may have conflicts with cabot corporation that we cannot resolve and  even if we are able to do so  the resolution of these conflicts may not be as favorable as if we were dealing with a party with whom we had never been affiliated 
for example  cabot corporation continues to be our primary supplier  subject to certain terms and conditions  of fumed silica and fumed alumina under a fumed metal oxide agreement that became effective upon completion of our initial public offering in april   and of fumed alumina under a fumed alumina supply agreement and an amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement  both of which we entered into in december  these and other agreements were made or structured in the context of an affiliated relationship and generally were negotiated in the overall context of our separation from cabot corporation 
the prices and other terms under these agreements may be less favorable to us than what we could have obtained in arm s length negotiations at the time with unaffiliated third parties for similar services or under similar agreements 
it is particularly difficult to assess whether the price for fumed metal oxides provided under our fumed metal oxide supply agreement and its december  amendment with respect to fumed alumina  fumed alumina supply agreement or other arrangements with cabot corporation is the same as or different from the price we could have obtained in arm s length negotiations at the time with an unaffiliated third party in light of the long term nature of the contracts  the volumes provided for under the agreements and our particular quality requirements 
at the time of the filing of our form q for the quarterly period ended december  and through april  two officers of cabot corporation served as members of our board of directors 
because of these relationships  which ceased as of april  we make the following disclosures during fiscal  we purchased approximately million of fumed metal oxides from cabot corporation under the fumed metal oxide agreement 
during fiscal  we paid cabot corporation million under that agreement 
the fumed alumina supply agreement did not become effective until fiscal  and we paid no amount to cabot corporation under it in fiscal during fiscal we paid cabot corporation million under the fumed alumina supply agreement 
if the spin off is not tax free  we could be liable to cabot corporation for the resulting taxes on september   cabot corporation effected the spin off of cabot microelectronics by distributing shares of our common stock as a dividend on each share of cabot corporation common stock outstanding on september   or an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
we have agreed to indemnify cabot corporation in the event the spin off is not tax free to cabot corporation as a result of various actions taken by or with respect to us or our failure to take various actions  all as set forth in our tax sharing agreement with cabot corporation 
we may not be able to control some of the events that could trigger this liability 
risks relating to the market for our common stock the market price may fluctuate significantly and rapidly the market price of our common stock has and could continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of factors such as economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact participants in the semiconductor industry  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our stock  earnings and other announcements by  and changes in market evaluations of  us or participants in the semiconductor industry  changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us or participants in the semiconductor industry  announcements or implementation by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new products  and trading volume of our common stock 
the securities of many companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years  often unrelated to the companies operating performance 
specifically  market prices for securities of technology related companies have frequently reached elevated levels  often following their initial public offerings 
these levels may not be sustainable and may not bear any relationship to these companies operating performances 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against a company 
if we were involved in a class action suit  it could divert the attention of senior management  and  if adversely determined  have a negative impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our rights plan and delaware general corporation law may adversely affect the price of our common stock  discourage third parties from making a bid for our company or reduce any premiums paid to our stockholders for their common stock our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  our rights plan and various provisions of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws  our rights plan and the various provisions of delaware general corporation law may adversely affect the price of our common stock  discourage third parties from making a bid for our company or reduce any premiums paid to our stockholders for their common stock 
for example  our amended certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock and to attach special rights and preferences to this preferred stock 
the issuance of this preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
also our amended certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three year terms 
this classification of our board of directors could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring control of our company 
in addition  the rights issued to our stockholders under our rights plan may make it more difficult or expensive for another person or entity to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors 
we have adopted change in control arrangements covering our executive officers and other key employees 
these arrangements provide for a cash severance payment  continued medical benefits and other ancillary payments and benefits upon termination of a covered employee s employment following a change in control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis foreign exchange rate risk during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of we had a foreign exchange exposure related to a note receivable denominated in japanese yen which resulted in unrealized foreign exchange gains of million 
in the fourth fiscal quarter we hedged this exposure and now believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on this note is not material 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures
