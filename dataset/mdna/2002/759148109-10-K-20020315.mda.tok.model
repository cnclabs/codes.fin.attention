item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide temporary healthcare staffing and therapy program management services for hospitals and long term care facilities 
we derive our revenue from two business segments temporary healthcare staffing and therapy program management 
our therapy program management segment includes inpatient programs including acute rehabilitation and skilled nursing units  outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs 
summarized information about our revenues and earnings from operations in each segment is provided below 
year ended december  in thousands revenues from unaffiliated customers healthcare staffing    therapy program management inpatient    contract therapy    outpatient    therapy program management total    total    operating earnings loss healthcare staffing   therapy program management inpatient    contract therapy   outpatient    therapy program management total    total    operating earnings for prior years have been adjusted to reflect the corporate expense allocation methodology utilized in includes million in non recurring charges 
revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payors 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy and temporary healthcare staffing services are typically provided under interim or short term agreements with hospitals and long term care facilities 
our healthcare staffing revenues and earnings are impacted by changes in the level of occupancy at hospitals where we provide our staffing services 
during the first and fourth quarters of each year  hospitals generally experience an increase in the number of patients  resulting in an increase in the demand for our temporary healthcare staffing services and an increase in our revenues and earnings in this line of business 
hospitals generally experience a decrease in the number of patients during the second and third quarters  resulting in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for our healthcare staffing services line 
as a provider of temporary healthcare staffing and therapy program management services  our revenues and growth are affected by trends and developments in healthcare spending 
over the last three years  our revenues and earnings from our therapy program management services have been negatively impacted by an aggregate decline in average billable lengths of stay 
the decline in average billable lengths of stay reflects the continued trend of reduced rehabilitation lengths of stay 
material changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements to our clients for services rendered in the programs that we manage could give our clients the right to renegotiate their existing contracts with us to include terms that are less favorable to us 
for example  outpatient therapy programs receive payment from the medicare program under a fee schedule 
under current law  an outpatient therapy program that is not designated as being provider based is subject to an annual limit on payments for therapy services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
see discussion under item business government regulation provider based rules 
however  application of this limit is subject to a moratorium through december  the secretary of the us department of health and human services is required to review reimbursement claims for outpatient therapy services while the moratorium is in effect and to make a proposal to congress to revise the payment system for outpatient therapy services 
any changes adopted by congress  which could include reduced annual limits or a new payment system  could have an adverse effect on the outpatient therapy program business 
in addition  changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements could negatively impact the benefits that we are able to provide to our clients 
the enactment of the balanced budget act of  which established a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities and units  significantly reduced the demand for therapists generally  which had a negative impact on our healthcare staffing business 
it also resulted in reduction of the per diem billing rates we were able to negotiate with the skilled nursing units that we manage 
we believe the recently released rates and other reimbursement regulations with respect to the implementation of a prospective payment system for acute rehabilitation services will be favorable for many of our clients 
however  we are unable to predict with certainty the impact of the changes at this time  and we may experience a decline in our revenue and earnings as a result of the prospective payment system or from any other changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements 
acquisitions during and  we completed a number of acquisitions 
these acquisitions are summarized in the table below 
each of the acquisitions has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting  which means that the operating results of the acquired entity are included in our results of operations commencing on the date of acquisition of each entity 
we have amortized the goodwill for each of our acquisitions  the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the book value of the net assets acquired  on a straight line basis over to years through the year ended december  as of january  the goodwill amortization periods were changed to years on the acquisitions of physical therapy resources  inc  teamrehab  inc moore rehabilitation services  inc  rehab unlimited  inc 
cimarron health care  inc  rehabilitative care systems of america  inc  therapeutic systems  inc  salt lake physical therapy associates  inc  allstaff  inc  and diversicare rehab services  inc this change resulted in a net after tax increase of approximately million in the annual goodwill amortization associated with these acquisitions and a decrease in diluted net earnings per share of approximately for the year ended december  we retained year amortization periods for the acquisitions of advanced rehabilitation resources  inc  healthcare staffing solutions  inc  starmed staffing  inc  and eai healthcare staffing solutions  inc  which had businesses that were more national in scope

inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continues to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole

effect of recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement no 
requires that goodwill with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
the company adopted the provisions of statement no 
on july  and the provisions of statement no 
on january  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement no 
accounting literature 
goodwill acquired in business combinations completed before july  continued to be amortized prior to the adoption of statement no 
as of the date of adoption of statement no 
 the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of approximately million  which is subject to the transition provisions of statements no 
and no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements no 
and no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we expect statement no 
to result in the elimination of amortization of goodwill from previous acquisitions in the amount of million pre tax in in october  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
statement no 
is intended to establish one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
the company adopted statement no 
on january  we do not expect statement no 
to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we specifically analyze accounts with historical poor payment history  and customer credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill relating to acquisitions consummated prior to july  is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the amortization periods differ depending on whether the acquired entity was national in scope or a regional provider 
goodwill related to the acquisition of a national provider is amortized over years  while goodwill related to a regional provider is amortized over years 
the company annually evaluates the carrying amounts of goodwill  as well as related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on the company s projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation over the remaining useful lives of the related goodwill 
to the extent such projections indicate future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related goodwill  the underlying assets are written down by charges to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to the fair value of the asset
