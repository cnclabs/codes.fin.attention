item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  this financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
disclosure and internal controls as of august   an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of autozone s management  including the ceo and cfo  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
based on that evaluation  autozone s management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of august  no significant changes in autozone s internal controls or in other factors have occurred that could significantly affect controls subsequent to august  critical accounting policies product warranties we provide our customers limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties 
we provide a reserve for warranty obligations at the time of sale based on each product s historical return rate 
certain product vendors pay all or a portion of our warranty expense 
however  at times  the vendors may not cover all of the warranty expense 
if we materially underestimate our warranty expense on products that are not fully warranted to us by our vendors  we may experience a material adverse impact on our reported financial position or results of operations 
if we incorrectly estimate our warranty expense  we will recognize any adjustment in income at the time it is determined 
litigation and other contingent liabilities we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business  such as employment matters  product liability  general liability related to our store premises and alleged violation of the robinson patman act as specifically described in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities  such as lawsuits and our retained liability for insured claims 
we do not believe that any of these contingent liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities are incorrect  the future results of operations for any particular fiscal quarter or year could be materially adversely affected 
some of our litigation is being conducted before juries in states where past jury awards have been significant  and we are unable to predict the results of any jury verdict 
if we incorrectly estimate our contingent liabilities  we will recognize any adjustment in income at the time it is determined 

table of contents vendor allowances we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors based on volume of purchases and in payment of services that autozone provides to the vendors 
monies received from vendors include rebates  allowances and cooperative advertising funds 
typically these funds are determined periodically and are  at times  dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans 
certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and other direct expenses and are recognized as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses when earned 
rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases and or product sales 
these monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold 
the amounts to be received are subject to changes in market conditions  vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise for autozone 
restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal  autozone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million 
the planned closure of domestic auto parts stores and the disposal of real estate projects in process and excess properties accounted for the largest portion  or million  of the charge 
in fiscal  these stores were closed  and sales of certain excess properties resulted in gains of approximately million 
remaining excess properties are currently being marketed for sale 
during the third quarter of fiscal  all remaining excess properties were reevaluated 
at that time  it was determined that several properties could be developed 
this resulted in the reversal of accrued lease obligations totaling million 
it was also determined that additional writedowns were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value 
these writedowns totaled million 
because fiscal adjustments offset  there was no impact on net income 
another portion of the charge  million  related to other asset writedowns and the accrual of lease obligations associated with the closure of a supply depot and for the unoccupied alldata office building 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the alldata office building was sold to a third party 
the reserve previously established was adequate to cover the loss incurred on the sale 
we continue to pursue the sale  sublease or early termination of the leases associated with the remaining leased facilities 

table of contents we also reserved million for inventory rationalization  including a provision for inventory losses in closed stores 
all of the scheduled recalls and disposals of inventory took place during fiscal the reserve was adequate to cover losses incurred 
asset writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating million related to the planned sale of truckpro  our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary  were recorded 
in december  truckpro was sold to a group of investors for cash proceeds of million and a promissory note 
we have deferred a gain on the sale of million due to uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain 
refer to note k in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction 
the remainder of the restructuring and impairment charges  million  related to contractual obligations  severance and other charges 
we did not reverse any reserves into income 
total remaining accrued obligations for restructuring charges were million at august  the following table presents a summary of the activity in accrued obligations for the restructuring charges contract settlements severance in thousands lease obligations terminations other beginning balance cash outlays adjustments balance at august  fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million or over net sales for fiscal excluding truckpro  which was sold during the year  net sales increased 
the sales increases were attributable to a increase in comparable store sales  or sales for domestic auto parts stores opened at least one year 
new store sales in fiscal year contributed two percentage points and net sales from the rd week contributed approximately two percentage points of the increase 
comparable store sales increased as a result of an increase in customer count and an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the prior year 
at august   we operated  domestic auto parts stores and in mexico  compared with  domestic auto parts stores  in mexico and truckpro stores at august  
table of contents gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales excluding nonrecurring charges for fiscal gross margin improvement reflected lower product costs  more efficient supply chain costs  reduced inventory shrinkage  the benefits of more strategic and disciplined pricing due to category management and the addition of more value added  high margin merchandise than in the prior year 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million over such expenses for fiscal but declined as a percentage of net sales from to excluding nonrecurring charges in the prior year 
the improved ratio reflects the fact that revenues rose more rapidly than the growth of store level expenses a percentage point improvement  combined with operating savings resulting from the restructuring in fiscal year related to controlling staffing  base salaries and technology spending of percentage points 
additionally  the prior year included other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of percentage points 
the adoption of new accounting rules for goodwill reduced operating expenses in fiscal by approximately million  or percentage points 
these improvements in the expense ratio were partially offset by additional bonus  legal  pension and insurance expenses incurred in the current year of percentage points 
net interest expense for fiscal year was million compared with million during fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower levels of debt compared with the prior fiscal year and lower average interest rates on short term borrowings 
weighted average borrowings for fiscal year were billion  compared with billion for fiscal additionally  weighted average borrowing rates were lower in the current year compared with the prior year at compared with 
autozone s effective income tax rate was of pretax income for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the tax rate is due primarily to the change in goodwill accounting 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million or over net sales for fiscal same store sales  or sales for domestic auto parts stores opened at least one year  increased 
additionally  new store sales in fiscal contributed of the sales increase 
the remaining sales increase was due to increased sales in our mexico stores  alldata and truckpro 
at august   we operated  domestic auto parts stores compared with  at august  gross profit for fiscal excluding nonrecurring charges was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher gross margin products in the current year and higher warranty expense in the prior year 

table of contents operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million over such expenses for fiscal excluding nonrecurring charges and increased as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to an increase in group insurance expenses of percentage points  an increase in risk management insurance expenses of percentage points  an increase in other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of percentage points and higher levels of payroll of percentage points  primarily in the first half of the year 
net interest expense for fiscal was million compared with million for fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to higher weighted average borrowings in fiscal compared with fiscal weighted average borrowings were billion in fiscal compared with billion in fiscal weighted average borrowing rates were slightly lower in fiscal compared with fiscal at compared with 
autozone s effective income tax rate was of pretax income for fiscal and for fiscal liquidity and capital resources capital requirements autozone s primary capital requirements have been the funding of its continued new store development program  inventory requirements and stock repurchases 
we opened or acquired  net new domestic auto parts stores from the beginning of fiscal to august  cash flow generated from store operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations in the current year is due primarily to higher net income  a larger increase in accounts payable and accruals and higher employee stock option exercises 
we invested million in capital assets in fiscal compared with million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal  we opened new auto parts stores in the us and in mexico  replaced us stores and closed us stores 
during the year we sold truckpro  our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary  which operated stores  for cash proceeds of million 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers  reducing the working capital required by expansion 
we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through favorable payment terms from suppliers  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such terms 

table of contents depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions  we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of our capital expenditures  working capital requirements and stock repurchases 
the balance will be funded through borrowings 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the past 
credit ratings at august   autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a moody s investors service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa and a commercial paper rating of p both rating agencies had autozone listed as having a negative outlook 
subsequent to year end  standard poor s changed its outlook for autozone to positive and moody s changed its outlook to stable 
if these credit ratings drop  autozone s interest expense may increase  similarly  we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised 
if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels  we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will increase  as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade  our access to financing may become more limited  and obligations under our equity forward agreements may be accelerated  requiring the agreements to be settled prior to their planned settlement date 
debt facilities we maintain million of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks 
of the million  million expires in may the remaining million expires in may the day facility expiring in may includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of the then outstanding debt by one year 
the credit facilities exist largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans 
at august   outstanding commercial paper of million is classified as long term as we have the ability and intention to refinance it on a long term basis 
the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of the london interbank offered rate libor  the lending bank s base rate as defined in the agreement or a competitive bid rate at our option 
we have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our credit agreements  including limitations on total indebtedness  restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage 
during fiscal year  we entered into million and million unsecured bank term loans with a group of banks 
during fiscal  the million two year unsecured term loan was increased to million and the maturity was extended to november the rate of interest payable is a function of libor or the bank s base rate as defined in the agreement at our option 
after the fiscal year end  on october   we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission 
this filing will allow us to sell as much as million in debt securities for general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing existing debt  and or to fund working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
on october   we issued million of senior notes under the registration statement 
the notes mature in october and interest is payable semi annually on april and october 
table of contents all of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements of autozone or its board of directors or if covenants are breached related to total indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage 
we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants 
stock repurchases as of august   our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to billion of common stock in the open market 
from january to august   approximately billion of common stock had been repurchased  including shares committed under outstanding forward purchase contracts 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of common stock 
the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of 
subsequent to year end  we repurchased million shares in partial settlement of the forward purchase contract outstanding at august   at an average cost of per share 
at times  we utilize equity forward agreements to facilitate our repurchase of common stock and to lock in current market prices for later purchase 
our obligations under the equity forward agreements are not reflected on our balance sheet 
autozone  at its option  may settle the forward purchase agreements in cash or in common stock 
financial commitments the following table shows autozone s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations payment due by period total contractual between between in thousands obligations less than year years years over years long term debt synthetic leases other operating leases construction obligations 
table of contents the following table shows autozone s other commitments amount of commitment expiration per period total other between between over in thousands commitments less than year years years years standby letters of credit surety bonds share repurchase obligations a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation carrier 
in conjunction with our commercial sales program  we offer credit to some of our commercial customers 
the receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse 
autozone has established a reserve for this recourse 
at august   the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of million and the balance of the recourse reserve was million 
autozone has a synthetic lease facility of million in total 
the facility expires in fiscal at august   million in synthetic lease obligations were outstanding  relating to a small number of our domestic auto parts stores 
the synthetic leases qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes and are not reflected as an asset or a liability on our balance sheet 
the lease payments on the stores are reflected in the income statement in operating expenses and we depreciate the underlying assets for tax purposes 
we have subleased some of our leased real property to other entities  including the purchaser of our former truckpro business 
if the purchaser of the truckpro business becomes unable to meet its obligations under the subleases  we might incur liabilities in connection with the recovery and subsequent sublease or lease termination of the properties 
inflation autozone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we have been successful  in many cases  in mitigating the effects of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through economies of scale  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 
seasonality and quarterly periods autozone s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of june through august  in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about to higher than in the slower months of december through february 
during short periods of time  autozone s business is also affected by weather conditions 

table of contents extremely hot or extremely cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products 
mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather 
over the long run  the effects of weather balance out  as we have stores throughout the united states 
each of the first three quarters of autozone s fiscal year consists of weeks  and the fourth quarter consists of weeks weeks in fiscal 
because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of weeks weeks in fiscal  compared to weeks for each of the first three quarters  our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income 
the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual net sales and of net income  the fourth quarter of fiscal  excluding nonrecurring charges  represented of annual net sales and of net income 
fiscal year consisted of weeks  with the fiscal fourth quarter including weeks 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains many of its fundamental provisions 
additionally  sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the provisions of sfas are effective for autozone s fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant financial impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and requires that a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant financial impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents risk factors we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates 
we have significantly increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years  growing from  stores at august   to  stores at august   an average store count increase per year of 
we do not plan to continue our store count growth rate at the historic pace 
in addition  a portion of our total sales increases each year results from increases in sales at existing stores 
we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to increase same store sales 
our business depends upon qualified employees 
at the end of fiscal year  our consolidated employee count was approximately  we do not know if we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates 
in the event of increasing wage rates  if we do not increase our wages competitively  our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or  alternatively  our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates 
if demand for our products slows  then our business may be materially affected 
demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors 
in the short term  it may depend upon the number of miles vehicles are driven annually  as increased vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair 
mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors 
the number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and older  as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles 
the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of severe weather impacting a wide geographic area 
the economy 
in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions  both do it yourself and do it for me customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair 
during periods of expansionary economic conditions  more of our do it yourself customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles 
for the long term  demand for our products may depend upon the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty offered on new vehicles 

table of contents restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell  we could lose customers and our revenues and profits may decline 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas  including name recognition  product availability  customer service  store location and price  with many competitors 
autozone competes in both the diy and commercial auto parts and accessories markets 
competitors include national and regional auto parts chains  independently owned parts stores  wholesalers and jobbers  repair shops  car washes and auto dealers  in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores  department stores  hardware stores  supermarkets  drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies  chemicals  accessories  tools and maintenance parts 
although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service  including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners  merchandise quality  selection and availability  product warranty  store layout  location and convenience  and the strength of our autozone brand name  some competitors may have competitive advantages  such as greater financial and marketing resources  larger stores with more merchandise  longer operating histories  more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising 
if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or our competitors develop more effective strategies  we could lose customers and our revenues and profits may decline 
if we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts business  our sales growth may be limited 
although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial do it for me market  to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors  in addition to other auto parts retailers that have recently entered the commercial business 
although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service  merchandise quality  selection and availability  and distribution locations  some automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have  have developed long term customer relationships and have larger available inventories 
we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers 
if our vendors continue to consolidate  we may pay higher prices for our merchandise 
recently  several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge 
further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products 

table of contents consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 
recently  several large auto parts chains have merged 
we do not know what impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket 
if our merging competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers  then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are strongest 
war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 
in the event of war  acts of terrorism  or either are threatened  it may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores 
some of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk autozone is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce such risks  we may periodically use various financial instruments 
to date  foreign exchange exposure has not been material 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to policies and procedures 
further  we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives and hedging financial market risk relating to autozone s operations results primarily from changes in interest rates 
we comply with statement of financial accounting standards nos 
 and collectively sfas pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas requires us to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
autozone reduces its exposure to increases in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements 
all of our interest rate swaps and treasury locks are designated as cash flow hedges 
autozone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at august   and at august   we held interest rate swap contracts related to million of variable rate debt 
of the million  million of the swaps mature in december and are used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with autozone s million term loan 
the remaining million of swaps expire throughout fiscal years and  and are used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings 
additionally  at august   we held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of million that expire in october and are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows of anticipated debt transactions 
the agreements will be settled upon the issuance of the debt 
upon settlement of the agreements  the realized gain or loss to be paid or received by autozone will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 

table of contents in accordance with sfas  autozone reflects the current fair value of interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements on its balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged have been recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate swap contract or treasury lock agreement does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the interest rate being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
for the fiscal years ended august   and august   all of our interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income 
the fair value of autozone s debt was estimated at billion as of august   and billion as of august   based on the market values of the debt at those dates 
such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt at august   by million and less than the carrying value of debt at august   by million 
we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at august   and million outstanding at august  at these borrowing levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on autozone s pretax earnings and cash flows of million in and million in  which includes the effects of interest rate swaps 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor
