item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genomics based pharmaceutical development company 
we apply proprietary functional genomic technologies  bioinformatic systems  and disease expertise to discover genes and proteins  and to determine how these genes and proteins function in the context of disease 
we use this information to develop protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics to treat metabolic diseases  cancer  inflammatory diseases  and central nervous system disorders 
we are developing protein drugs on our own behalf 
we have established an alliance with abgenix  inc abgenix to develop antibody drugs across all diseases areas  and have established an alliance with bayer ag bayer to develop small molecule drugs to treat obesity and diabetes 
we are currently pursuing additional collaborations to develop small molecule drugs across other disease areas 
we were incorporated in november and  until march  were engaged primarily in organizational activities  research and development of our technology  grant preparation and obtaining financing 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over the next several years as we expand our drug discovery and development operations 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to earn revenues and become profitable is dependent primarily on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based upon our expertise in genomics  our technologies  and our drug discovery and development programs 
accomplishing this goal also depends in part on our ability to maintain our existing strategic alliances with bayer and abgenix  and on our ability to establish new alliances to aid us in developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics 
we cannot guarantee that any such strategic alliances  either new or existing  will be successful 
we have also established a majority owned subsidiary  corporation  to develop novel technologies for rapidly and comprehensively analyzing entire genomes 
we expect that will commercialize these products upon their development  which may be a future source of revenues for us 
our failure to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated for us from commercial sales of products developed through the application of our technologies and respective expertise are not expected for several years  if at all 
the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used in all dollar amounts are shown in thousands  except per share data 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and as such  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies  which are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  include the following revenue recognition 
we have entered into certain collaborative research agreements that provide for the partial or complete funding of specified projects in exchange for access to  and certain rights in  the data discovered under the related projects 
revenue is recognized based upon work performed or upon the attainment of certain benchmarks or milestones specified in the related agreements 
we have also entered into a collaborative research exchange agreement in which services and technology access are exchanged between the collaborative partners 
revenues and expenses under this exchange agreement are based upon the fair value of the work performed by each collaborative partner 
deferred revenue arising from payments received from collaborative agreements is recognized as income when earned 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we consider investments readily convertible into cash  with an original maturity of three months or less  to be cash equivalents 
investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered short term investments 
the carrying amount of the investments approximates fair value due to their short maturity 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  ranging from three to seven years  using the straight line method 
equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the terms of the lease  using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life or the term of the lease  using the straight line method 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  land is not required to be depreciated 
patent application costs 
costs incurred in filing for patents are charged to operations  until such time as it is determined that the filing will be successful 
when it becomes evident with reasonable certainty that an application will be successful  the costs incurred in filing for patents will begin to be capitalized 
capitalized costs related to successful patent applications will be amortized over a period not to exceed twenty years or the remaining life of the patent  whichever is shorter  using the straight line method 
stock based compensation 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which was effective for us beginning january  sfas requires expanded disclosures of stock based compensation arrangements with employees and non employees and encourages but does not require compensation cost to be measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded to employees 
companies are permitted to continue to apply accounting principles board apb no 
 which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instruments awarded 
we will continue to apply apb no 
to our stock based compensation awards to employees 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  as compared to  for the corresponding period in revenues recorded in the twelve month period ended december  were primarily related to our collaborative arrangements with abgenix  bayer  cor therapeutics  inc cor  and glaxosmithkline  inc gsk while the same period in primarily included revenue from our collaborative arrangements with abgenix  cor  genentech  inc genentech and gsk 
revenue from each of abgenix  bayer  and gsk accounted for or more of our total revenue in fiscal abgenix  cor  dupont pioneer hi bred international  inc dupont pioneer hi bred  genentech  gsk  hoffmann la roche inc and its affiliate  roche vitamins  inc roche each accounted for or more of our total revenue in the revenue we recognize under our collaborative agreements is generally based upon work performed or the attainment of certain benchmarks and milestones specified in the related agreements 
future revenue growth will be dependent upon our ability to enter into additional collaborations and strategic alliances  maintain and expand current collaborations  receive royalties and milestone payments from products currently under development by our current and former collaborators and successfully develop and market products that may arise from our own internal product pipeline 
we expect collaborative revenues to decrease slightly from levels  unless we enter into new agreements  or receive royalties and milestone payments from products currently under development by our current and former collaborative partners 
operating expenses 
collaborative research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in the increase of  or  was primarily attributable to increased internal research efforts and our obligations to fulfill research requirements under new and existing collaborations  which resulted in increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation and facilities expenses  and additional personnel costs

interest income  net 
net interest income for the year ended december  of  increased  or  as compared to  for the same period in gross interest income for the year ended december  of  increased  or  as compared to  for the same period in the increase in gross interest income was primarily due to higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as a result of funds we received from the proceeds of our public offering in november and from the combined net proceeds from our private placements with abgenix in november and bayer in january  offset by recent declines in interest rates 
we anticipate that gross interest income will begin to decrease as cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are utilized in the normal course of operations 
gross interest expense for the year ended december  of  represented an increase of  or  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase in gross interest expense was primarily attributable to accrued interest and interest paid to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt which we issued on february  we expect gross interest expense to remain relatively constant in income taxes 
for the year ended december   we have recorded a connecticut research and development income tax benefit of  we recorded this income tax benefit as a result of connecticut legislation  which allows companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at a rate of of their annual research and development expense credit  in exchange for foregoing carryforward of their research and development credit 
during  we anticipate that the income tax benefit will be approximately  as we incur additional qualifying collaborative research and development costs 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  valuation allowances in amounts equal to the deferred income tax assets have been established to reflect these uncertainties in all periods presented

recently enacted pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting

certain factors that may affect results of operations this report may contain forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
these statements include statements regarding i our ability to apply proprietary genomic technologies to understand the molecular basis of disease and develop the next generation of therapeutic products for important diseases  ii the expected transformation of the pharmaceutical industry and our opportunities with respect thereto  iii our ability to advance promising therapeutics into the clinic and to leverage the entire human genome in order to accomplish that goal  iv our ability to establish our fully integrated technologies and genescape operating system as the preferred platform for genomics  drug discovery  drug development and pharmacogenomics  v the likely success of our technologies  vi the expected benefits  effects  efficiency and performance of our services and products  vii our ability to enter into additional collaborations and strategic alliances  maintain and expand current collaborations  receive royalties and milestone payments from products currently under development by current and former collaborators and successfully develop and market products from our internal product pipeline  viii the suitability of company discovered genes and proteins involved in diabetes  hypertension and obesity as targets for small molecule drug development  ix the capacity of our products to predict the efficiency and safety of drugs already on the market and in development pipelines  x the ability of our subsidiary   to commercialize products upon their development and create a future source of revenues for us  xi the expected future levels of losses  operating expenses and material commitments 
such statements are based on our management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we caution investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our stage of development as a genomics based pharmaceutical company  uncertainties of clinical trials  government regulation and healthcare reform  technological uncertainty and product development risks  product liability exposure  uncertainty of additional funding  our history of incurring losses and the uncertainty of achieving profitability  reliance on research collaborations and strategic alliances  competition  and our ability to protect our patents and proprietary rights  and uncertainties relating to commercialization rights 
for further information  refer to the more specific risks and uncertainties discussed throughout this discussion and analysis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  we maintain approximately half of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less  and the remainder in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  a change of basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  bear interest at fixed rates  therefore  our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes 
although future borrowings would be affected by interest rate changes  at this point we do not anticipate any significant future borrowings  and therefore do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition
