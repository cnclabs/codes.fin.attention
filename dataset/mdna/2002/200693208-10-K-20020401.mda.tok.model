item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background commerce one is a provider of business to business electronic commerce solutions that link buyers and suppliers of goods and services into trading communities over the internet and intranets 
recently our business model has increasingly shifted focus toward enterprise software solutions ie  sales of solutions to companies for their internal use in addition to our historical focus on trading communities 
we were founded as distrivision in  changed our name to commerce one in  and re incorporated into delaware in on july   we completed our reorganization into a holding company structure 
as part of the reorganization  the stockholders of the old commerce one now our wholly owned subsidiary commerce one operations  inc became stockholders of the new commerce one 
the financial results reported in this annual report on form k include  as applicable  the financial results of commerce one after the reorganization and the historical financial results of commerce one operations prior to the reorganization 
the reorganization is described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
source of revenues we generate revenues from multiple sources 
license fees are generated from licensing our software solutions to end user organizations  third party product distributors and resellers 
services revenues are generated from professional consulting  software maintenance  application hosting  transaction and subscription fees  revenue sharing arrangements with partners  and other related services 
revenues from transactions  subscription fees and revenue sharing arrangements have not been a significant portion of total services revenues to date 
we recently downsized our global services division  which provides professional services to third parties  through reductions in force and divestitures 
although in recent quarters our services revenue has been a substantial portion of our overall revenue  we expect a substantial decrease in service revenue over the next few quarters as a result of the downsizing 
the portion of our license and service revenues attributable to sales outside the united states continues to be a substantial portion of our overall revenues  although it has decreased in the past year 
in  approximately of our license and service revenues were derived from sales outside united states  compared to in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  software product returns  warranty obligations  uncollectible accounts receivable and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
we believe that these significant judgments affect the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are consistent with statement of position software revenue recognition  as modified by statement of position revenues from license agreements for our software products are recognized upon delivery of the software if there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
if an acceptance period is required  license revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
when our software is licensed to third parties through indirect sales channels  generally license fees are recognized as revenue  under the sell through method  when the criteria described above have been met and the reseller has sold the software to an end user customer 
while generally we do not license software under barter or concurrent arrangements  whenever software has been licensed under such arrangements  we have recognized revenue equal to the net monetary amounts to be received by us 
we reduce license revenue to reflect estimated product returns 
while as a matter of contract and general practice  we do not accept the return of software products after the expiration of any acceptance periods  unforeseen contractual disputes with customers may require us to accept the return of a product 
should our actual product returns differ from estimates  revisions to the product return allowance would be required 
we charge estimated product warranty costs to cost of licenses at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes prior to the release of software  unforeseen product errors may exist in our products that may require us to incur costs to correct or replace the affected products 
should our actual costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty costs would be required 
revenues from professional services contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  with costs and estimated profits recorded as work is performed 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in contract performance and estimated profitability  including final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and revenues  which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
if a customer transaction includes both software license and services elements  or the rights to multiple software products  the total arrangement fee is allocated to each of the elements using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered elements 
revenue is recognized using contract accounting for arrangements involving significant customization or modifications of the software or where professional services are considered necessary to the functionality of the software 
revenue from these software and services arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
software maintenance revenues and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the related contract  typically one year 
network service fees transaction fees  hosting fees and revenue sharing  have not been significant and are not expected to be material in the future 
revenues related to transaction fees and revenue sharing are recognized as earned based on customer transactions 
revenues related to hosting fees are recognized ratably over the term of the related contracts  typically one year 
deferred revenue consists of license fees for which revenue has been deferred and prepaid fees for services  subscription fees  and maintenance and support agreements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make such payments  increases in the allowance may be required 
during  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts due to an increase in managements estimate of uncollectible amounts due from customers 
long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we periodically assess the carrying value of our long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill  our technology agreement with covisint and other identified intangible assets for impairment 
an impairment assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  our net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and significant under performance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
in assessing the recoverability of the current carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in  we recorded impairment charges related to certain prior acquisitions and a technology agreement we entered into with covisint 
effective as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and are now required to analyze goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
effective as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company will apply the provisions of sfas no 
prospectively 
stock option exchange program on march   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  employees were given the opportunity to elect to cancel outstanding stock options held by them in exchange for an equal number of replacement options to be granted at a future date 
the elections to cancel options were effective on april  the exchange resulted in the voluntary cancellation by  employees of options to purchase  shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from to per share in exchange for the same number of replacement options 
the replacement options were granted on october  at an exercise price of per share of common stock  and have the same terms and conditions as each optionee s cancelled options  including the historical vesting schedule and expiration date of the cancelled options 
employees were eligible to participate in the program  non employee board members  former employees and consultants were ineligible to participate 
we did not incur any compensation charge in connection with the program 
relationship with sap commercial relationship on september   we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with sap and sapmarkets collectively  sap to jointly develop  market and sell the marketset suite of applications and the enterprise buyer procurement applications 
this agreement provided that either party licensing the jointly developed products to its customers would owe a royalty to the other party 
the amount of the royalty was generally based on a percentage of the total license fee paid by the customer 
during  commerce one and sap amended these agreements to provide for different rights to resell certain technology included in the jointly developed products and for varying royalty rates and maintenance fees depending on the particular product  category of customer and other factors 
effective january   we amended our strategic alliance agreement with sap to simplify its royalty payment provisions and to provide that sap will have an unlimited right to resell the jointly developed products  in addition to a right to resell certain other commerce one technology on an oem basis  during the first three quarters of in return for an aggregate fee of approximately million  comprised primarily of license fees  as well as associated maintenance and support 
these fees will be credited against sap s prior pre payments to commerce one  which have been recorded by commerce one as deferred revenue  and the license fees will be recognized ratably over the three quarter period 
the amendment provides that during this three quarter period  commerce one will pay sap a royalty based upon a fixed percentage of the total license fee for jointly developed products sold by commerce one 
the amendment further provides that the royalty payments for such rights shall be renegotiated by the parties prior to september  and the agreement will default to the historical royalty structure in the event the parties fail to agree on a new payment schedule by that date 
the amendment further provides that each of the parties intend to phase out the jointly developed enterprise buyer procurement products and replace such products over time with its own successor procurement products 
as a result  we anticipate that corresponding revenues received by commerce one from sap for the sale of such products will decline in the future as the parties shift their focus to their respective procurement products 
we further anticipate that revenues from the marketset product  primarily targeted at the e marketplace sector  may decline over time as we shift our focus to our other enterprise applications 
equity relationship at the time we entered into the strategic alliance agreement with sap in  we sold  shares of our common stock to sap for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
subsequently  in  we sold an additional  shares of our common stock to sap for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with our issuance of common stock to sap  we entered into various agreements that restrict sap s ability to acquire more than of our outstanding common stock or otherwise attempt to acquire control of commerce one  restrict its transfer the shares of common stock it purchased from us and  in very limited ways  affect sap s ability to votes its shares of our common stock 
we also granted sap certain rights to require us to register the resale of its shares of our common stock  certain pro rata rights to acquire additional shares of our common stock and the right to have a designee appointed to our board of directors or to send an observer to our board of directors meetings 
as of march   sap has not exercised its right to have such a designee appointed  but has exercised its right to send an observer to our board of directors meetings 
as of december   through its purchases from us and on the open market  sap owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
revenues resulting from royalty arrangements with sap sap has been instrumental in assisting us with selling our jointly developed products  marketset and enterprise buyer  to its customer base 
we receive royalty payments from sap whenever sap sells these joint products to their customers 
in these instances  sap typically licenses the product to its customer and the sale is documented by an agreement between sap and the customer 
commerce one and sap have taken this approach for a variety of reasons  including administrative efficiency  particularly where the customer had an existing license relationship with sap 
when commerce one and sap take this approach  we record the royalty payment received from sap in connection with the sale to the customer as revenues received from sap 
sap s royalty payments to us constituted a substantial portion of our revenues in and in and  sap reported royalties to us of approximately million and million  respectively  of which license revenues were approximately million and million  respectively 
as described above under the terms of the amended strategic alliance agreement with sap  effective january   sap will have an unlimited right to resell the jointly developed products  in addition to a right to resell certain other commerce one technology on an oem basis  during the first three quarters of  in return for aggregate fees of approximately million  comprised primarily of license fees  as well as associated maintenance and support 
these fees will be credited against sap s prior prepayments to commerce one  which have been recorded by commerce one as deferred revenue  and the license fees will be recognized ratably over the three quarter period 
sap has historically made non refundable royalty prepayments to us  which we have recorded as deferred revenue as payments are received 
as sap incurs the obligation to pay royalties to us  these royalties are credited against this deferred revenue 
prepayments received from sap and included in deferred revenue totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
when we license one of the jointly developed products to our customers  we pay a royalty to sap in connection with the sale 
we record the royalty payments due to sap as a reduction of license or support revenue  as appropriate 
in and  we made royalty payments to sap of approximately million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that sap s contribution to our license revenues will decline over time as commerce one and sap substitute the enterprise buyer procurement products with the parties respective successor procurement products and as we increase our focus on developing  marketing and selling our enterprise applications 
to a lesser extent  we have also generated revenue from our relationship with sap by performing professional services as a subcontractor to sap  primarily on software implementation engagements where we have jointly sold marketset or enterprise buyer to an sap customer 
sap has also completed professional services for us by acting as a subcontractor  primarily in relation to the jointly sold marketset or enterprise buyer products 
we also expect these revenues and expenses to decline over time 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations for the company expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and the company s historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
commerce one  inc 
consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenues license fees services total revenues costs and expenses cost of license fees cost of services sales and marketing product development general and administrative purchased in process research and development stock compensation restructuring costs and other amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of intangible assets and equity investments total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income and other  net provision for income taxes net loss years ended december   and revenue total revenues for increased to approximately million compared to million for and million for license revenues for decreased to approximately million compared to million for license revenues increased in when compared to license revenues of million in in  the decrease in license revenues primarily resulted from a significant slowdown in technology orders spending coupled with a general economic downturn  a significantly longer sales cycle and significantly fewer opportunities to license e marketplaces resulting in fewer and lower priced customer orders 
service revenues for increased to million compared to million in and million in the percentage of our revenues attributable to professional services in increased significantly compared to this resulted primarily from the acquisition of appnet  a professional services company  in september  and due to a lesser extent from an increase in both software maintenance and hosting services revenues 
following our acquisition of appnet  we consolidated its operations into our global services division 
global services provides services in connection with the implementation of our software products 
the increase in the percentage of our revenues attributable to professional services resulted in a decline in our overall gross margin percentage because services revenues carry a significantly lower gross margin than license revenues 
if this percentage increases in the future  our gross margins will decline further 
we recently downsized our global services division through reductions in force and divestitures and  although in recent quarters our services revenues have been a substantial portion of our overall revenues  we expect a substantial decrease in service revenues over the next few quarters as a result of the downsizing 
royalty payments received from our strategic alliance with sap constituted a substantial portion of our total revenues during the years and total revenues received from sap were approximately million and million for the years and  respectively  of which license revenues were approximately million and million for the years and  respectively 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consisting of cost of services and cost of licenses were approximately million  or of total revenues  in  million  or of total revenues  in  and million  or of total revenues  in cost of license fees was million for  compared to million for and million for in  cost of license fees was primarily composed of charges related to the impairment of the technology agreement with covisint of approximately million and the amortization of the cost of the technology agreement with covisint of approximately million 
in cost of license fees included charges related to the amortization of the cost of technology agreement with covisint of approximately million 
we currently estimate that the amortization of the technology agreement with covisint will be approximately million per quarter over the remaining nine year term of the agreement 
the technology agreement with covisint is discussed more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of services  which primarily consists of consulting  software maintenance and training costs  was million for  million for and million for the increase in cost of services resulted primarily from an increase in personnel related expenses due to the hiring and training of consulting  support and training personnel in the united states  europe and asia pacific and personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount due to the acquisition of appnet in september as of december  the overall number of employees working in our global services division was  a significant decrease from  as of december  consistent with the decrease in the size of our professional services organization  we expect a decline in professional services costs over the next few quarters 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  and the costs of seminars  promotional materials  trade shows and other sales and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses were approximately million for  million for and million for the increase in was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of sales and marketing personnel during the year as well as an increase in marketing related activity related to product user conferences held during the year 
the number of employees engaged in sales and marketing was at december  compared to at december  and at december  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease substantially over the next year primarily due to a decrease in the number of employees in this area as part of our corporate restructuring 
product development expenses product development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with our product development efforts 
product development expenses were approximately million for  million for and million for the increase in product development expenses was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of product development personnel employed during the year and increased consulting related expenses to support development of our products 
the overall number of employees engaged in product development increased slightly to at december   compared to at december  and at december  we do not expect product development expenses to increase substantially over the next year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses for executive  administrative and finance personnel 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million for  million for and million for the increase in was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of general and administrative personnel employed during the year  due to among other things our acquisition of appnet in september  an increase in various accounting and legal costs associated with operating our business and an increase in bad debt expense charged during the year for certain uncollectible customer accounts 
the number of employees engaged in general and administrative functions was at december   compared to at december  and at december  we expect general and administrative expenses will decrease over the next year due primarily to an expected decrease in the average number of employees in this area as part of the corporate restructuring 
purchased in process research and development in may  we acquired exterprise  a provider of platform solutions that enable the development and deployment of e commerce applications for corporations 
the acquisition was structured as a common stock for common stock merger and was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
the purchase consideration was approximately million  consisting of million shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million  assumption of option to acquire approximately  shares of common stock with a fair value of million and transaction costs of approximately million 
we estimated that approximately million of the million purchase consideration represented purchased in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was charged to operations in the total purchase cost for the exterprise acquisition has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based upon estimates of their fair value 
the following table depicts the total purchase cost and the allocation thereof in thousands cash accounts receivable assumed liabilities deferred compensation intangible assets assembled workforce purchase technology patents goodwill total intangible assets purchased in process research and development charged to operations in total purchase cost goodwill arising from the acquisition was amortized on a straight line basis over five years until december  effective january  goodwill will be assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
purchased in process research consisted of a sourcing application and the next generation of proprietary technology related to agent based process engine platforms apex 
the sourcing application will incorporate functionality such as an electronic request for a quote  contract management  demand aggregation  supplier relationship management and management reporting  whereas the next generation apex platform is being updated to increase processing speed and reliability 
the value of the acquired in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income stream of the related purchased in process research and development revenues 
the discounted cash flow analysis was based on management s forecast of future revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses related to the technologies purchased from exterprise 
the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of exterprise prior to the close of the acquisition 
at the time of acquisition  the marketplace sourcing and apex platform products were estimated at being and complete  respectively 
the technology was made available in our products during the first quarter of and both are expected to have a technological life of approximately four years 
the resultant value of in process technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core technology  which was included in capitalized developed technology 
the discount rates selected for estimating future discounted cash flows for the core and in process technology was and  respectively 
in the selection of the appropriate discount rates  consideration was given to our estimated weighted average return on working capital and our estimated weighted average return on assets 
these discount rates are consistent with both our weighted average cost of capital and the implied transaction discount rate 
the discount rate reflects both the risk factors associated with a company projecting high growth rates  improved profitability  and increased rates of return associated with intangible assets 
stock compensation stock compensation expenses result from the grant of stock options  grant of restricted common stock and sales of stock to employees at exercise or sales prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock 
stock compensation expense was approximately million in  million in and million in the increase in stock compensation expense in was primarily attributable to the vesting of certain options assumed in the acquisitions of appnet and exterprise  and the grant of restricted common stock to employees 
the deferred stock compensation is being amortized over the three to four year vesting period of the related options using a graded vesting method 
we anticipate incurring deferred stock compensation expense relating to these options of approximately million in the vesting period of the options range from three to four years 
the expense related to the restricted stock grant made to our employees in may is being amortized on straight line basis over a two year vesting period 
restructuring costs and other in february  management approved and began to implement a corporate restructuring plan the plan aimed at streamlining our cost structure to better position us for growth and improved operating results 
included in the plan were costs related to severance pay  outplacement services  benefits continuation  office closure costs and the termination of certain office leases 
the plan included staff reductions totaling approximately employees  which were completed within the first and second quarters of we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million in connection with the plan in the first quarter of in june  management approved and began to implement a further corporate restructuring plan the second plan aimed at optimizing and streamlining the company so that we could effectively focus on our core e business strategy 
under the second plan  we estimated and charged restructuring costs of approximately million in the second quarter of the second plan included the costs associated with the termination of approximately employees including severance pay  outplacement services and benefit continuation  estimated customer claims resulting from the divestiture of certain operations within our global services division  and also the termination of certain office leases  the consolidation or closure of certain facilities and the write down of the carrying value of computers and equipment used by terminated employees 
in october  management approved and began to implement an additional restructuring program the third plan  which included further staff reductions totaling approximately  employees  to be completed within the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the reductions have been achieved through a reduction in force  attrition and the divestiture of a number of professional service operations within our global services division that are not directly related to our core product offering 
under the third plan  we charged a further million to restructuring expenses in relation to the costs associated with terminating  employees  costs associated with the termination of office leases  and the consolidation and closure of certain facilities and subsidiaries 
also in the fourth quarter of  we determined that amounts previously charged in the second quarter of of approximately million that related to estimated customer claims resulting from the divestiture of certain professional services operations within our global services division were no longer required  and these amounts were credited to other costs in the fourth quarter of the net charge to the restructure costs and other was therefore approximately in the fourth quarter of as part of the third plan  we completed the divestiture and liquidation of certain professional services operations within our global services division 
these service divisions were initially acquired through the acquisition of appnet inc  in september  and were either divested through management buy outs during the fourth quarter of  or the first quarter of  or ceased business operations 
the divestitures completed in connection with the third plan are discussed in more detail below 
we recognized total revenues of approximately million in from our professional services operations within our global services division  which were disposed of in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of under the third plan 
the following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring liability for the year ended december   in thousands amounts charged to restructuring costs and other amounts reversed net amounts charged to restructuring costs and other amounts paid or written off accrued restructuring costs at december  lease cancellations and commitments termination payments to employees and related costs write off on disposal of assets and related costs costs associated with divestiture of certain businesses total lease cancellations and commitments in the first  second and fourth quarters of we incurred total restructuring charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for facilities consolidated or closed in the united states  europe and asia 
these offices were primarily responsible for the sale of our software products  professional services or customer support 
these restructuring charges reflect the remaining contractual obligations under facility leases net of anticipated sublease income from the date of facility abandonment to the end of the lease term 
certain facilities continued in use during the completion of the restructuring for which we continued to record monthly rent expense until the facilities were available for sub lease or were abandoned 
accrued restructuring costs related to lease cancellations and commitments as at december  were approximately million of which non current amounts accrued were approximately million 
we estimate that cash payments for lease cancellations and commitments  net of any sublease income  will be approximately million in and approximately million for non current lease obligation payments which are payable through to july termination payments to employees and related costs in the first  second and fourth quarters of  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for the termination of approximately  employees to cover costs such as separation pay  outplacement services and benefit continuation 
the separation payments and termination benefits were accrued and charged to restructuring costs in the period that both the benefit amounts were determined and such amounts were communicated to the affected employees 
the employee reductions came from all areas of the company and  as of december   all of the employees affected under the plan  second plan and third plan had been notified and the majority of these terminations had been completed 
we expect accrued restructuring costs of approximately million  as at december   will be fully paid during write off on disposal of assets and related costs in the second and fourth quarters of  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to the carrying values of equipment and leasehold improvements abandoned in connection with the restructuring and exit costs associated with the anticipated liabilities for estimated customer claims resulting from the divestiture of certain operations within our global services division 
included within the assets disposed of and charged to restructuring costs were personal computers and equipment used by employees terminated  office equipment and leaseholds in connection with closure or consolidation of facilities and subsidiaries in the united states  asia and europe 
all identified assets had been taken out of service and were held for disposal at the end of the quarter for which they were identified for inclusion in the second and third plans 
included within the second quarter of charge of million were amounts associated with the anticipated liabilities for estimated customer claims resulting from the divestiture of certain operations within our global services division which were no longer core to our business 
the amounts accrued were based on our estimation of the likely costs associated with the exit of certain service contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated this liability based on the actual customer claims received  amounts paid and the successful execution of certain exit activities 
we reduced the liability by million with a corresponding credit to the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of we expect accrued restructuring costs of approximately million  as at december   will be fully paid in costs associated with divestiture of certain businesses in october  we entered into and executed an asset sale to beaconfire consulting inc  a company composed of former commerce one employees 
in consideration for the assets sold  we received a note receivable with a face value of approximately million due on september   that bears an annual interest rate of receivable on a quarterly basis 
subject to certain criteria  we also have the rights to a and annual share of future revenues of beaconfire consulting for the next and succeeding years  respectively  following the closing of this transaction 
also in october  we entered into and executed a stock transfer and asset sale to edgar  dunn company  inc  a company composed of former commerce one employees 
in connection with this agreement  we received a equity interest in edgar  dunn company  inc  and two notes receivable with face values totaling million that are due by september  the notes bear an annual interest rate of receivable primarily on a quarterly basis 
subject to certain criteria  we also have the rights to an annual revenue share of of the revenues of edgar  dunn company  inc  for the four years following the closing of this transaction 
on january   we entered into and executed an asset sale agreement with connective commerce company llc  a massachusetts limited liability company  composed of former commerce one employees 
in connection with this agreement  the company received cash of approximately million and a note receivable with a face value of approximately million due on december   that bears a quarterly interest rate of  receivable on a quarterly basis commencing september  on february   we entered into and executed a stock purchase agreement with commerce one e government solutions  inc  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and egov holdings  inc  a delaware corporation composed of former company employees 
in consideration for the sale of of the outstanding common stock of commerce one e government solutions  inc to egov holdings  inc  we received cash consideration of approximately million 
as a result of the business divestitures completed in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a loss on divestiture of million that was charged to restructuring costs and other in the fourth quarter of we estimate that as a result of the business divestitures completed in the first quarter of we will record a gain of approximately million based on the cash proceeds received from the sale of e government solutions  inc we recognized total revenues of approximately million in from our professional services operations within our global services division which were disposed of in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of under the third plan 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately million in  million in and million in the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulted from the acquisitions of veo systems and commercebid during  mergent and appnet during  and exterprise in may impairment of intangible assets and investments we periodically assess the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill  the technology agreement with covisint and other identified intangible assets 
an impairment assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of our long lived assets 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  our net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we performed  with the assistance of independent valuation experts  impairment tests to determine whether any impairment existed 
we determined that the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to certain of our intangible assets was less than the carrying value of those intangible assets 
accordingly  we calculated the estimated fair value of the assets by summing the present value of the expected cash flows over the life of the assets 
the impairment was then calculated by deducting the present value of the expected cash flows from the carrying value of the intangible assets 
based on the results of these tests  we determined that the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets related to appnet  the technology agreement with covisint and commercebid were not recoverable and therefore had suffered impairment 
this assessment resulted in a write down during of  million to record the amount by which the carrying amounts of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to appnet and commercebid exceeded their respective fair values 
further  an impairment write down of million was recorded in relation to the technology agreement with covisint and this amount was charged to cost of license fees in we again performed an impairment analysis based on undiscounted cash flows to determine whether any further impairment existed with regard to the carrying value of our long lived assets in the third and fourth quarters of we concluded that based on the results of these tests the carrying values of goodwill and other identified intangible assets were still recoverable and therefore had not suffered any further impairment 
we may record further impairment charges in the future if impairment indicators exist and an impairment assessment indicates that the carrying value of our intangible assets and investments are no longer recoverable 
we have made several strategic investments in privately held companies and two publicly traded companies 
we own less than a interest in each of these companies and do not have a significant influence over these companies 
investments in publicly traded companies are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in equity 
investments in private companies are recorded at cost 
these investments are periodically evaluated for declines in value which are considered other than temporary 
during the year we recorded investment losses of approximately million of which million related to the investment in covisint  million related to investments in other privately held companies and million related to investments in publicly traded companies 
as at december  we held investments recorded at approximately million related to our investment in covisint and other strategic investments 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  increased by approximately million to million in and increased by approximately million to million in the increase in interest  net  for was primarily attributable to interest income earned on higher average cash and investment balances in compared to  despite the general decline in average interest rates during the increase in was due mainly to an increase in interest income due to higher average cash and investment balances during compared to provision for income taxes the income tax provision for  and is the result of withholding and income taxes generated in certain foreign jurisdictions 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net loss operating carry forwards 
due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million at december  compared to approximately million as at december  the amounts as of december   included approximately million which collateralized certain of our obligations related to operating lease agreements for office facilities  potential workers compensation claims and guarantee of a personal home mortgage of an executive officer 
we have historically satisfied our cash requirements primarily through the issuances of equity securities 
in september and june  we issued common stock to sap for aggregate proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
on march  we entered into an alliance agreement with microsoft in connection with the marketing  promotion and optimization of commerce one products using microsoft technology 
to support the optimization  microsoft made a two year  interest free loan of million to us 
this loan was originally due on march  but would become immediately payable in the event we breached certain provisions of the loan agreement or alliance agreement 
on march   commerce one and microsoft terminated the alliance agreement and revised the terms of the loan agreement 
under the revised terms  the million loan is now due on april  and bears interest at per annum  payable quarterly 
the loan will become immediately due  however  if our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balance falls below million at any point during the term of the revised loan 
we have also agreed to secure the loan with a million cash collateral account 
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million for  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million for and net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from the net loss in and a decrease in deferred revenues and accrued compensation and related expenses which was partly offset by the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  amortization of deferred stock compensation and non cash charges due to the impairment of the technology agreement with covisint  the impairment of the equity investment held in covisint  and the goodwill associated with the acquisitions of commercebid and appnet 
net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million for  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities related primarily to the purchase of short term investments  the purchase and sale of property and equipment and additional costs of the technology agreement with covisint 
this was partially offset by the net proceeds from the maturity of short term investments  disposal of property and equipment and investment gains 
our net capital expenditures were approximately million for  million for and million for our capital expenditures have historically consisted of purchases and capitalized leases of computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for  compared to million in and million in the cash provided in resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock to sap  as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and cash proceeds drawn from an interest free loan in connection with the alliance agreement entered into with microsoft corporation during the first quarter of the cash from financing in resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock to sap and the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from an initial public offering and concurrent private placement of our common stock and the exercise of employee stock options 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in certain future periods after december  in thousands total less than one year to years years and thereafter non cancelable operating lease obligations microsoft loan total non cancelable operating leases obligations include million which were accrued as restructuring costs as of december  and are payable through to july we have no significant commitments or obligations other than these described in the analysis above 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor have we any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entity 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to finance our operating losses and working capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors 
the rate of expansion of our operations in response to potential acquisition opportunities  growth opportunities and competitive pressures will affect our capital requirements as will funding of continued net losses and substantial negative cash flows 
if we do not decrease or reserve our negative cash flows we will be forced to seek additional financing in the future 
if we require additional capital resources  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure a bank line of credit 
we currently have no committed bank credit facility available 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under sfas no 
 pooling of interest is no longer an acceptable method of accounting for business combinations 
sfas no 
also develops further criteria for recognizing intangible assets separate from goodwill in a purchase transaction 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement 
in july the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be periodically assessed for any indication of impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective at january  during the transition period for goodwill and intangible assets acquired on or before june  and those acquired after that date  pre existing goodwill and intangibles are to be amortized during this transition period until adoption of sfas no 
 whereas any new goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired on or after july  will be reviewed for future impairment indicators 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
in will result in a reduced operating charge for the amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
we have not yet determined whether we will incur additional impairment charges as a result of the transition provisions of sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
consistent with sfas no 
 sfas no 
continues to require a step approach for recognizing and measuring the impairment of long lived assets held for use 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective from january  and these provisions will be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors beginning on page interest rate risk as of december   we had cash  highly liquid investments and short term investments of approximately million 
these investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates decrease 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by percent from the market interest rates at december  would cause the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents to change by an immaterial amount 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk substantially all of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in us dollars  a significant portion of which have been transacted with customers outside the united states 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive in international markets 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and although we have never used financial hedging techniques to date  we may use them in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that these fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
equity price risk from time to time  we make investments in private companies  particularly private companies that are strategic partners or customers of ours 
as of december   our investment in private companies had a carrying value of approximately million 
if these companies do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recoup our investment 
the recent general decline in the nasdaq stock market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any further declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments
