year over year constant currency disposable sales growth was a result of growth in worldwide surgical up  worldwide bloodbank up worldwide red cell up  and worldwide plasma sales up 
the constant currency growth in the worldwide surgical disposable sales is mainly attributed to volume increases of existing products in the european markets and the success of the company s recently launched orthopat r product in the us orthopedic market 
worldwide bloodbank disposable sales increased as compared to as a result of volume increases in platelet disposable sales in japan and volume increases in the us market resulting from the rollout of the acp tm automated cell processing system 
the growth in worldwide red cell sales is attributed to volume increases in the us and european markets 
the growth of red cells was unfavorably impacted by the events of september  and by the delay in the further rollout of the double red cell technology by the american red cross arc 
the arc is awaiting approval from the food and drug administration on software information system changes and standard operating procedure upgrades necessary to expand its red cell program beyond its four current sites 
the growth in worldwide plasma disposables sales is attributed to volume increases of products sold in the us due to the continued upturn in plasma collections as demand for source plasma outpaces supply 
of the constant currency plasma growth  approximately of it was due to sales of bottles resulting from the company s acquisition of the plasma container business in the fourth quarter of last year and from the sales of haemonetics brand anticoagulant solution introduced to the company s plasma product line last year 
the company expects plasma growth to moderate in fiscal due to slower growth in plasma collections as well as the effects of industry consolidation  which will result in the loss of one plasma customer

accordingly  the amounts were immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations as acquired research and development see note in the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition and ipr d charges 
a brief description of the ipr d projects related to the acquisition of transfusion  including their estimated stage of completion and associated discount rates is outlined below 
chairside separator css 
the css is a portable  automated device used for the donor side collection and processing of a single unit of whole blood into a unit of red cell concentrate and plasma 
the system is designed for use in a blood center  hospital  or mobile blood drive location and can be powered either through a standard ac outlet or by dc battery packs 
at the time of the acquisition  haemonetics estimated that the css project was complete and that product sales would commence by the fourth quarter of fiscal the ipr d value assigned to the css was million

the estimated cost to be incurred to develop the purchased in process rcc technology into a commercially viable product is million in fiscal and million in fiscal other unusual charges unusual charges expensed as a result of the acquisition of transfusion amounted to million and included million in bonuses paid to key transfusion executives hired by haemonetics and severance to employees laid off due to overlaps created by the merger  a million write off of an investment in fluid warming technology which haemonetics decided not to pursue in lieu of the technologies acquired in the merger  and the adjustment required to modify the investment of transfusion by haemonetics in november of fiscal year from the cost method to the equity method of accounting as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
to affect this change  the historic cost of the investment made by haemonetics was written down by its share of the monthly losses incurred by transfusion from november the charge to the statement of operations related to this cost to equity adjustment was million for the year ended march  operating income operating income for  as a percentage of net revenues  increased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal at constant currency rates  operating income increased by million 
the million increase in operating income resulted largely from the million of constant currency improvements in gross profit year over year  million in decreased acquired research and development and unusual charges in fiscal as compared to fiscal offset by increases in the current year in selling  general and administrative expenses 
foreign exchange the company generates of its revenues outside the us in foreign currencies 
as such  the company uses a combination of business and financial tools comprised of various natural hedges offsetting exposures from local production costs and operating expenses and forward contracts to hedge its balance sheet and p l exposures 
hedging through the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates  but because the company generally enters into forward contracts one year out  rates are fixed for a one year period  thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation 
the company computes a composite rate index for purposes of measuring  comparatively  the change in foreign currency hedge spot rates from the hedge spot rates of the corresponding period in the prior year 
the relative value of currencies in the index corresponds to the value of sales in those currencies 
the composite was set at based upon the weighted rates at march  for fiscal year  the indexed hedge rates were more favorable than those in fiscal for fiscal  the indexed hedge spot rates were less favorable than those in year  and for fiscal year  the indexed hedge spot rates are less favorable than those in fiscal these indexed hedge rates represent the change in spot value value on the day the hedge contract is undertaken of the haemonetics specific hedge rate index 
these indexed hedge rates impact sales in the company s financial statements 
the final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results

year over year constant currency disposable sales growth was a result of growth in worldwide red cell sales of  worldwide surgical sales of and worldwide plasma sales of 
the increase in worldwide red cell sales is attributable to volume increases in both the us and europe as the rollout of this new technology in these markets continues to gain strength 
the growth in worldwide surgical disposable sales is mainly attributed to volume increase and the mix effect of products sold in the us and japan markets 
the company views the increasing prices of red cells around the world and the favorable autotransfusion economics its surgical product offerings deliver  as factors contributing to the volume increases 
the increase in plasma disposable sales is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the new plasma collection bottle and the addition of the newly approved anticoagulant to the plasma product line in the us market 
constant currency sales of disposable products  excluding service and other miscellaneous revenue  accounted for approximately and of net revenues for fiscal year and  respectively 
service revenue generated from equipment repairs performed under preventive maintenance contracts or emergency service billings and miscellaneous revenues accounted for and of the company s net revenues  at constant currency  for fiscal year and  respectively 
equipment revenues decreased from million in fiscal at actual rates and decreased year over year with currency rates held constant 
the decrease was a result of lower equipment revenues in the surgical and plasma product lines  mainly in the us  and in asia due to a large equipment sale in the prior year 
the overall decrease in revenue recognized on equipment shipments represents a continuing trend of customer preference for  and the company s policy of  moving toward placing on loan company owned equipment versus selling it under long term  sales type leases 
reasons for customer preference vary significantly but include the customers preference to be relieved from certain risks of ownership  particularly the equipment s economic useful life and technological obsolescence 
from the company s point of view  placing company owned equipment versus selling it  allows the company to better track the location and the utilization of the equipment 
international sales as reported accounted for approximately and of net revenues for fiscal and  respectively

significant design  software programming  disposable set development and sourcing requirements are still to be completed 
in addition  clinical trials will be conducted prior to submission of a k to the fda 
the estimated cost to be incurred to develop the purchased in process rcc technology into a commercially viable product is approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal other unusual charges a relating to the acquisition of transfusion technologies unusual charges expensed in the twelve months ended march   as a result of the acquisition of transfusion amounted to million 
these charges included million in bonuses paid to key transfusion executives hired by haemonetics and severance to haemonetics employees laid off due to overlaps created by the merger  a million write off of an investment in technology which haemonetics decided not to pursue in lieu of the technologies acquired in the merger  and the adjustment required to modify the investment of transfusion by haemonetics in november of fiscal year from the cost method to the equity method of accounting as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
to effect this change  the historic cost of the investment made by haemonetics was written down by its share of the losses incurred by transfusion technologies from november of fiscal year through the date of acquisition of the remaining 
the charge to the consolidated statement of operations related to this cost to equity adjustment was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal b other beginning in fiscal year  the company placed approximately  plasma collection machines in china under a sales type lease contract with a local distributor 
the sales type lease contract included minimum annual disposable products use commitments per machine under contract and included a ramp up period 
in march of  the company reassessed its ability to realize the full value of the sales type lease as originally recorded given that the ramp up in disposable purchases expected had not materialized 
in the company s opinion two main factors or market conditions contributed to the distributor s failure to meet its disposable purchase commitments 
although the chinese government passed an executive order in making manual plasma collection unlawful  government authorities failed to enforce the order and manual plasma collection  which is much less costly for the collector  continues for a large percentage of total plasma collections 
secondly  the availability of  and lack of enforcement against  unauthorized local copies of disposable products at a lower cost  significantly impacted purchases from foreign suppliers  including haemonetics 
given the change in market conditions  a reassessment of the contract was performed with a new estimate of future disposable purchases and related cash flows considering the reduced percentage of the market willing to use automated collection with foreign manufactured products and because of pricing concessions extended to the local distributor by haemonetics 
based on the reassessment  the company wrote down the investment in sales type leases by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and reflected this as an unusual charge on its consolidated statement of operations 
operating income operating income for  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal at constant currency rates  operating income decreased from fiscal or by million 
the million decrease in operating income resulted largely from the million year over year increase in combined ipr d and other unusual items related to the acquisition of transfusion technologies and million in combined increases in operating expenses for investments in r d and new product selling and marketing programs offset by the non recurrence of the million write down of the sales type lease in china in fiscal and the million increase in gross profit at constant currency rates 
other income  net interest expense decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a reduction in the average outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates 
interest income decreased million for compared to fiscal other income  net increased million due to increases in income earned from points on forward contracts  which was partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange transaction losses 
points on forward contracts are amounts  either paid or earned  based on the interest rate differential between two foreign currencies in a forward hedge contract 
taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of pretax income  was for  up from in before the effect of non deductible charges in connection with the acquisition of transfusion technologies  the company s effective tax rate was for  down from in the decrease in the effective tax rate from was primarily attributable to maximizing tax benefits on funds repatriated and increased export benefits generated by the company s foreign sales corporation

 which was recently published by the sec  recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note of its financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact its financial condition and results of operations  the company views certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on the company s financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in sab no 
which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery  including customer acceptance  has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policy is critical because revenue is a very significant component of its results of operations 
decisions relative to criteria regarding collectibility are based upon management judgments and should conditions change in the future and cause management to determine this criteria is not met  the company s recognized results may be affected 
with the company s acquisition of fifth dimension information systems  inc fifth dimension in january  the company has recorded software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and in instances where services are essential to the functionality of the software  which represents the majority of fifth dimensions software sales  revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in accordance sop  when the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees are dependent upon the performance of the services  the software license  configuration  training and implementation fees are recognized under the contract method of accounting using labor hours to measure the completion percentage 
in order to apply the contract method of accounting  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
the company does not believe its software revenue recognition policy is a critical policy however  due to the insignificance of the related software revenue recognized to date 
income taxes in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  income tax expense is calculated for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are periodically evaluated to determine their recoverability  and where their recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established and a corresponding additional tax expense is recorded in the company s statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from the company s estimates given changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
as of march   no valuation allowance existed on the company s books 
the total net deferred tax asset as of march  was million 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
on a quarterly basis  inventory quantities on hand are reviewed and an analysis of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory is performed based primarily on the company s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued as a result of understating its provision for excess and obsolete inventory  such costs would be required to be recorded in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if its inventory is determined to be undervalued  as a result of overstating its provision for excess and obsolete inventory  the company may have over reported its costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the company s forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other intangibles purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
in addition  as described in notes and of the company s financial statements  as a result of the company s acquisitions  values were assigned to intangible assets for patented and unpatented technologies and customer contracts and related relationships 
finite useful lives were assigned to these intangibles and they will be amortized over their remaining life 
as with any intangible asset  future write downs may be required if the value of these assets becomes impaired 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
any change in conditions that would cause management to change its estimate as to the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly impact the company s depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and a provision for estimated credit losses is maintained based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
concentration risk exists relative to the company s accounts receivable  as of the company s total accounts receivable balance for is concentrated in one unaffiliated japanese customer 
while the accounts receivable related to this customer may be significant  the company does not believe the credit loss risk to be significant given the consistent payment history by this customer 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital include cash and cash equivalents  internally generated cash flows and bank borrowings 
the company believes these sources to be sufficient to fund its requirements  which are derived primarily from capital expenditures  acquisitions  new business development  share repurchase and working capital 
during the twelve months ended march   the company funded its activities primarily with cash and cash equivalents of million  from cash flows generated by operations  million from stock option proceeds and million from debt borrowings 
working capital as of march  was million 
this reflects an increase of million in working capital from the year ended march   largely due to increases in accounts receivable  inventories and short term borrowings  offset by a decline in cash and cash equivalents 
a summary of the company s contractual and commercial commitments as of march  were as follows see note and note to the consolidated financial statements payments due by period less than after contractual obligations in thousands total year years years years debt      operating leases      total      the decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents during the twelve months ended march  from operating  investing and financing activities before the effect of exchange rates represents a decrease in cash flow of million compared to the million in cash generated in the million decrease was a result of less cash generated by the company s operating activities  an increase in cash flows utilized by the company s financing activities  offset by a reduction of cash utilized on investing activities 
operating activities the company generated million in cash from operating activities during the twelve months ended march  as compared to million generated during the twelve months ended march  the million decrease in operating cash flow from fiscal year to fiscal year was a result of a million increase in inventories due to higher raw material  work in process and finished good levels needed to support higher sales  a million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales  a million decrease in accountspayable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities in and a million decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items 
the company measures its performance using an operating cash flow metric defined as net income adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment together with the investment in haemonetics equipment at customer sites  including sales type leases  and the change in operating working capital  including change in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses  excluding tax accounts and the effects of currency translation 
this alternative measure of operating cash flows is a non gaap measure that may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
it is intended to assist readers of the report who employ free cash flow and similar measures that do not include tax assets and liabilities  equity investments and other sources and uses that are outside the day to day activities of a company 
as measured by the company s operating cash flow metric  the company generated million and million of operating cash during fiscal and  respectively 
the operating cash generated for excludes the investment to acquire fifth dimension and the payment made to acquire technology under development  which amounted to million in the aggregate 
fiscal excludes cash spent to first invest in  and later acquire  transfusion technologies and the alpha therapeutics bottle plant  which amounted  in the aggregate  to million in fiscal the million of operating cash flow in fiscal resulted from million of net income adjusted for non cash items and million from the reduction of the company s net investment in property  plant and equipment and sales type leases 
offsetting these was million from increased working capital investment  primarily higher accounts receivable due to higher sales  with an increase in inventories of million 
these increased working capital investments were offset by increased cash from million in higher accounts payable and accrued payroll 
the million of operating cash flow in fiscal resulted from million of net income adjusted for non cash items and million from the reduction of the company s net investment in property  plant and equipment and sales type leases

such risks and uncertainties include technological advances in the medical field and the company s ability to successfully implement products that incorporate such advances  product demand and market acceptance of the company s products  regulatory uncertainties  the effect of economic conditions  the impact of competitive products and pricing  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in customers ordering patterns and the effect of uncertainties in markets outside the us including europe and asia in which the company operates 
the foregoing list should not be construed as exhaustive 
euro currency effective january   of the countries in the european union austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  holland  ireland  italy  luxembourg  portugal and spain adopted a single currency known as the euro 
for the three years following january   these countries were allowed to transact business in both the euro and in their own currencies at fixed exchange rates 
beginning on july   the euro will become the only currency for these countries 
operations in europe the introduction of the euro impacted the company s operations 
the company has subsidiaries located throughout europe  that generate one third of its sales 
date of conversion the conversion at the company s subsidiaries now using the euro currency was successfully achieved on april   which was the first day of the company s fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposures relative to market risk are due to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk greater than of the company s revenues are generated outside the us yet the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
foreign exchange risk arises because the company engages in business in foreign countries in local currency 
exposure is partially mitigated by producing and sourcing product in local currency 
accordingly  whenever the us dollar strengthens relative to the other major currencies  there is an adverse affect on the company s results of operations and alternatively  whenever the us dollar weakens relative to the other major currencies  there is a positive effect on the company s results of operations 
it is the company s policy to minimize for a period of time the unforeseen impact on its results of operations of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments known as forward contracts to hedge the majority of its firm sales commitments to customers that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also enters into forward contracts that settle within days to hedge certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
actual gains and losses on all forward contracts are recorded in operations  offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying transactions being hedged 
these derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the company s primary foreign currency exposures in relation to the us dollar are the japanese yen and the euro 
at march   the company had the following outstanding foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm sales commitments denominated in foreign currency buy sell weighted discounted hedged local forward us unrealized unrealized currency currency contract rate current fwd gain loss gain loss maturity euro     apr jun euro     jul sept euro     oct dec euro     jan feb japanese yen  per us    apr jun japanese yen  per us    jul sept japanese yen  per us    oct dec japanese yen  per us    jan feb total    the company estimated the change in the fair value of all forward contracts assuming both a strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to all other major currencies 
in the event of a strengthening of the us dollar  the change in fair value of all forward contracts would create an additional million unrealized gain  whereas a weakening of the us dollar would reduce the unrecorded gain by million 
interest rate risk all of the company s long term debt is at fixed rates 
accordingly  a change in interest rates has an insignificant effect on the company s interest expense 
the fair value of the company s long term debt however  would change in response to interest rates movements due to its fixed rate nature 
at march   the fair value of the company s long term debt was approximately million higher than the value of the debt reflected on the company s financial statements 
this higher fair market is primarily related to the company s million  fixed rate senior notes and the million  real estate mortgage 
these notes and the real estate mortgage represent approximately of the company s outstanding long term borrowings at march  at march   the fair value of the company s long term debt was million higher than the value of the debt reflected on the company s financial statements 
this higher fair market is primarily related to the million  fixed rate senior notes the company holds 
fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources and management estimates using a scenario analysis  the company evaluated the impact on all long term maturities of changing the interest rate from the rate levels  which existed at march  the effect was a change in the fair value of the company s long term debt  of approximately million 
concentration of credit risk and significant customers financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable and investment in sales type lease receivables 
sales to one unaffiliated japanese customer amounted to million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
concentration risk on the company s accounts receivable is attributable to this customer who accounted for  and of total accounts receivable for  and  respectively 
while the accounts receivable related to this customer may be significant  the company does not believe the credit loss risk to be significant given the consistent payment history by this customer
