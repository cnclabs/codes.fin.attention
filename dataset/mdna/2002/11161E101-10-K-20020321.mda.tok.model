item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks discussed in factors that may affect out future results below and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture and sell high performance all optical and electrical optical communications systems that we believe accelerate carrier revenue opportunities and lower the overall cost of network ownership for carriers 
our optical products have enabled a fundamental shift in network design and efficiency by allowing for the transmission  switching and management of communications traffic entirely in the optical domain 
by deploying our products  carriers eliminate the need for expensive and bandwidth limiting electrical regeneration and switching equipment  significantly reducing costs  increasing network capacity and allowing them to more quickly and efficiently provide new services 
our products also open new market opportunities for carriers by enabling a flexible  in service migration path from existing point to point and ring electrical optical networks to all optical mesh networks 
we currently have five customers  including broadwing communications  inc  williams communications  inc  qwest communications corporation  telefonica de espana sau  and an unnamed major global carrier 
during the first half of  we shipped  installed and activated laboratory trial systems and field trial systems for both broadwing and williams to allow for customer testing and inspection 
in july  we successfully completed the broadwing field trial and broadwing agreed to purchase million of our products and services as part of a multi year purchase agreement 
throughout the remainder of  we began the deployment of both transmission and switching equipment to broadwing and built up finished goods inventory necessary to support customer orders throughout shipments of equipment to broadwing continued throughout the year 
sales to broadwing through december  have totaled million 
in  the field trial system provided to williams was accepted and williams agreed to purchase up to million of our products and services in a multi year purchase agreement  million of which must be purchased prior to december  sales to williams through december  have totaled million 
shipment of commercial equipment to williams began late in the first quarter of and continues to date 
in late february  williams announced that it is considering restructuring options  which may include filing a chapter bankruptcy case 
at december   we were not aware of any factors that would indicate that williams would be unable to meet its obligations to us 
qwest agreed to purchase million of our products  some of which are currently under development  over a two year period beginning on the date that the products meet agreed technical requirements 
qwest s purchase obligations are also subject to our products being priced competitively 
although our agreement with qwest anticipated technical acceptance by december   qwest s testing of our equipment in its labs is ongoing 
recently  qwest terminated a million purchase order that it had issued to us under this agreement in april we expect to continue with further testing and product enhancements to meet qwest s unique specifications for its network 
we are currently in discussions with qwest to modify the terms of the agreement to permit ongoing testing and further product development 
these discussions are also likely to involve modifications to the agreement regarding network deployment schedules and purchase level obligations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully agree to modified terms  or if we do  whether the new terms will include minimum purchase obligations 
if we are able to agree on these modifications  it is likely that the agreement would provide qwest with the ability to terminate if  among other circumstances  corvis products do not meet the new technical requirements 
we expect that any new terms will be agreed to by march  and if new terms are not agreed to by that date  it is likely that the agreement will terminate 
in the second quarter  the company entered into a contract with an unnamed major global carrier and reached agreement with spanish operator telefonica for the delivery of our next generation optical products 
these contracts are in early stages and do not include significant purchase commitment levels  however  we hope to develop these arrangements into long term business relationships 
we have also entered into agreements and discussions regarding laboratory and field trials with other carriers 
upon successful completion of these trials  we hope to enter into agreements for commercial deployment with new carriers 
recently  economic conditions have resulted in reduced capital expenditures by telecommunications carriers 
in response to these conditions  we implemented restructuring plans  approved by our board of directors  designed to decrease our business expenses and to align resources for long term growth opportunities 
additionally  we evaluated the carrying value of our inventory and long term assets 
in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan for the reduction of operations 
as a result of the restructuring plan and our evaluation of the recoverability of long lived asset carrying values  we recorded charges of approximately million 
these charges were comprised of million in cost of revenue charges associated with the inventory write downs and losses on open purchase commitment cancellations  million associated with workforce reduction  million associated with consolidation of excess facilities and write downs of idle equipment  million associated with the write down of goodwill generated in the acquisition of algety telecom sa  and million associated with the permanent impairment charges on strategic equity investments carried at cost 
in the fourth quarter of  after continued unfavorable economic conditions and the lack of expected contract wins and product sales  our board of directors approved an additional plan for further reductions in operations  including the closure of our operations in canada 
as a result of this restructuring plan and evaluation of our inventory and recoverability of long lived assets carrying value in light of the continued decrease in customer activity  we recorded charges of approximately million 
these charges were comprised of million in cost of revenue charges associated with inventory write downs and losses on open purchase commitments and an unprofitable contract  million associated with workforce reductions  million associated with consolidation of excess facilities and write downs of idle equipment  million associated with write down of goodwill principally generated in the acquisition of algety  and million associated with permanent impairment charges on strategic equity investments carried at cost 
we continue to monitor our financial position and will make strategic decisions as necessary to position the company for long term success 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  product warranty liabilities  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon execution of a contract and the completion of all delivery obligations provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and collectibility is deemed probable 
customer contracts generally include extensive lab and field trial testing and some include other acceptance criteria 
to the extent customer contracts include acceptance criteria  to date the company has deferred revenue until customer acceptance criteria have been met 
our products can be installed by our customers  third party service providers or by us 
revenue from installation services is recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply contract combine product acceptance with installation  in which case revenues for installation services are recognized when the terms of acceptance are satisfied and installation is completed 
to the extent customer contracts include both product sales and installation services  revenues are recognized on their respective fair values 
revenues from installation service fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each installation contract 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet 
costs of revenue 
costs of revenue include the costs of manufacturing our products and other costs associated with warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing  engineering  finishing and installation operations 
warranty reserves are determined based upon actual warranty cost experience  estimates of component failure rates and management s industry experience 
inventory obsolescence costs are estimated using certain assumptions  including projected sales and sales mix 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we continually monitor component failures  technical changes  and levels of on hand inventory and adjust our estimates accordingly 
if  however  actual results vary significantly from our estimates  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
allowance for bad debt 
during  we have relied on two customers for all of our revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers 
we monitor the financial conditions of these customers closely and concluded that no allowance for bad debt was appropriate as of december  at december   million or percent of our trade accounts receivable are due from williams  with the balance due from broadwing 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  williams has paid us approximately million of the december  accounts receivable as it became due 
at december   all amounts due from williams were current and  based on our historical collections from williams and all publicly available financial information  we determined that no allowance for uncollectible amounts was necessary 
subsequent to year end  williams has disclosed certain recent events that may potentially adversely affect its financial condition 
based on these events  in late february  williams announced that it is considering restructuring options  which may include filing a petition for chapter bankruptcy protection 
if a customer files for bankruptcy protection under chapter  we cannot be certain when we will receive outstanding payments  and if we do  how much will actually be received 
in addition  there may be other provisions under bankruptcy laws that would impact our ability to collect any amounts owed and may affect some payments that we have already received 
bankruptcy laws may also allow williams  under certain circumstances  to reject the purchase agreement 
we continue to evaluate the need for allowances for accounts receivable and can give no assurances we will not be required to write off some or all these outstanding amounts 
restructuring and other charges 
during  after continued unfavorable economic conditions and continued lack of expected customer wins and product sales  our board of directors approved plans for the reduction of operations including the consolidation of facilities  reduction of employees and the discontinuation of certain product lines 
in addition  we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value of our inventory and long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded charges associated with estimated excess inventory and open purchase commitments based on projected sales volumes  facility consolidation costs based on assumed exit costs and time tables  disposal of property and equipment based on estimated salvage values and goodwill impairment charges based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  we will adjust our reserves and allowances accordingly 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions 
through december   goodwill and intangibles have been amortized on a straight line basis over their respective lives of between and years 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we will cease amortizing goodwill and will perform an annual impairment analysis to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
litigation 
in july  ciena corporation ciena informed us of its belief that there is significant correspondence between products that we offer and several us patents held by ciena relating to optical networking systems and related dense wavelength division multiplexing communications systems technologies 
on july   ciena filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging that we are willfully infringing three of ciena s patents 
ciena is seeking injunctive relief  monetary damages including treble damages  as well as costs of the lawsuit  including attorneys fees 
on september   we filed an answer to the complaint  as well as counter claims alleging  among other things  invalidity and or unenforceability of the three patents in question 
on march   a motion was granted  allowing ciena to amend its complaint to include allegations that we are willfully infringing two additional patents 
a trial date had originally been set for april   however  it has recently been postponed by the court 
the litigation is currently in the pre trial phase 
between may  and june   nine putative class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york relating to our initial public offering on behalf of all persons who purchased our stock between july  and the filing of the complaints 
each of the complaints names as defendants corvis  our directors and officers who signed the registration statement in connection with our initial public offering  and certain of the underwriters that participated in our initial public offering 
the complaints allege that the registration statement and prospectus relating to our initial public offering contained material misrepresentations and or omissions in that those documents did not disclose that certain of the underwriters had solicited and received undisclosed fees and commissions and other economic benefits from some investors in connection with the distribution of our common stock in the initial public offering and that certain of the underwriters had entered into arrangements with some investors that were designed to distort and or inflate the market price for our common stock in the aftermarket following the initial public offering 
the complaints ask the court to award to members of the class the right to rescind their purchases of corvis common stock or to be awarded rescissory damages if the class member has sold its corvis stock and prejudgment and post judgment interest  reasonable attorneys and experts witness fees and other costs 
plaintiffs have move to appoint lead plaintiff and lead counsel 
by order october   the court appointed an executive committee of six plaintiffs law firms to coordinate their claims and function as lead counsel 
the motion to appoint lead plaintiff is pending 
on october   a group of underwriter defendants moved for judge scheindlin s recusal 
judge scheindlin denied that application 
on december   the moving underwriter defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus seeking the disqualification of judge scheindlin in the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
the petition is currently pending before the second circuit 
judge scheindlin issued a short order  stating that the court will continue to hold case management conferences  and will continue to handle other administrative and procedural matters 
however  the court will refrain from making any substantive rulings pending the second circuit s decision on the mandamus petition 
dispositive motions have not yet been filed 
no discovery has occurred 
the court has ordered plaintiffs to file consolidated amended complaints in each consolidated action at the end of march based on the status of the litigation  we cannot reasonably predict the likelihood of any potential outcome 
we continue to monitor the status of the litigation  however we can give no assurances that an unfavorable outcome will not result in future charges 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in revenue is attributable to the increased sales of our products for commercial use 
revenue for the year ended and is attributable to two customers and one customer  respectively 
during  our quarterly revenues have decreased from a high of million in the first quarter of to a low of million in the fourth quarter 
we expect revenue for the first quarter of to be at or below fourth quarter levels 
gross profit loss 
costs of revenue consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering  finishing and installation operations 
in association with discontinued product lines under our restructuring plans and excessive inventories due to reduced capital expenditures by telecommunication carriers  during we recorded cost of revenue charges totaling million comprised of inventory write downs of million and losses from open purchase commitments and loss contracts of approximately million 
gross profit loss decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the fiscal year ended december  from for the fiscal year ended december  excluding inventory write downs and other charges of million for the fiscal year ended december   gross profit and gross margin were million and  respectively 
due to current competitive and economic pressures on our prices  we expect that gross margin  excluding inventory write downs and other charges  may decrease in the coming quarters 
research and development  excluding equity based expense 
research and development  excluding equity based expense consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  test and prototype expenses related to the design of our hardware and software products  laboratory costs and facilities costs 
all costs related to product development  both hardware and software  are recorded as expenses in the period in which they are incurred 
due to the timing and nature of the expenses associated with research and development  significant quarterly fluctuations may result 
we believe that research and development is critical in achieving current and future strategic product objectives 
research and development expenses  excluding equity based expense  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to increases in headcount and increased expenses associated with prototype development and laboratory materials 
sales and marketing  excluding equity based expense 
sales and marketing  excluding equity based expense consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory trial systems provided to customers  trade shows  other marketing programs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding equity based expense  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to increases in headcount  increases in promotional and trade show activities and expenses related to laboratory systems provided to current and potential customers

equity based expense related to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative functions for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in equity based compensation resulted from options granted with exercise prices below fair value at the date of grant related primarily to pre ipo grants 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets primarily relates to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of algety telecom sa as a result of the issuance of sfas no 
 we will no longer record amortization of goodwill on a straight line basis  rather goodwill will be tested at least annually for impairment 
there may be more volatility in reported income loss than previous standards because impairment losses are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that are separate and have finite useful lives  such as acquired patent rights and intellectual property licenses  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as a result  amortization expense associated with goodwill should decrease in future periods 
amortization of intangible assets expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the acquisition of algety telecom sa  which resulted in approximately million in goodwill  excluding the impacts of the impairment charges described above  that is amortized over five years 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million of net interest income for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average invested cash balances from the proceeds of the initial public offering and other private placements and lower average returns on investments  offset in part by interest incurred under various credit facilities 
year ended december  compared to year ended january  revenue 
revenue increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from zero for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in revenue is attributable to the acceptance of a field trial system and the subsequent sale of network hardware and software to broadwing under a million two year purchase agreement 
gross profit 
costs of revenue consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering  finishing and installation operations

equity based expense related to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative functions for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended january  the increase in equity based compensation resulted from options granted with exercise prices below fair value at the date of grant  as well as expenses recognized upon the waiving of certain forfeiture provisions contained in warrants granted to certain customers 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets primarily relates to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of algety telecom sa as a result of the issuance of sfas no 
 we will no longer record amortization of goodwill on a straight line basis  rather goodwill will be tested at least annually for impairment 
there may be more volatility in reported income loss than previous standards because impairment losses are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives  such as acquired patent rights and intellectual property licenses  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as a result  amortization expense associated with goodwill should decrease in future periods 
amortization of intangible assets expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisition of algety telecom sa  which resulted in approximately million in goodwill  before considering the impairment charges described above  that is amortized over five years 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased to million for the year ended december  from million of net interest expense for the year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to average higher invested cash balances from the proceeds of the initial public offering and other private placements  offset in part by interest incurred under various credit facilities 
liquidity and capital resources since inception through december   we have financed our operations  capital expenditures and working capital primarily through public and private sales of our capital stock  borrowings under credit and lease facilities and cash generated from operations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and january   respectively 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a net loss of  million  million of inventory increases  and a decrease in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities payable of million and non cash expense items approximating  million including restructuring  goodwill impairment and other charges of million  depreciation and amortization of million equity based expense of million  and asset impairment and other charges of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   december  and january  was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to purchases of manufacturing and test equipment  information systems equipment and office equipment and purchases of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to the sale of investments associated with restricted cash  partially offset by the repayment of principal on notes and capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  million  primarily attributable to proceeds from our initial public offering and other private placements  and the issuance of notes payable  offset in part by the payment of debt and an increase in restricted cash 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended january  was million  primarily attributable to private placements and the proceeds from the issuance of notes payable 
as of december   long term restricted cash totaled million associated with outstanding irrevocable letters of credit relating to lease obligations for various manufacturing and office facilities and other business arrangements 
these letters of credit are collateralized by funds in our operating account 
various portions of the letters of credit expire at the end of each respective lease term or agreement term 
due to competitive economic conditions  we have and may be required to sell our product to future customers at lower margins or be required to provide customers with financing which could result in reduced gross margins  extended payment terms or delayed revenue recognition  all of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
our liquidity will also be dependent on our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
changes in the timing and extent of the sale of our products will affect our liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
we currently have a limited number of customers that could provide substantially all of our revenues for the near future and these customers are operating in a troubled economic environment 
the loss of any of these customers  any substantial reduction in current or anticipated orders or an inability to attract new customers  could materially adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
we plan to diversify our customer base by seeking new customers both domestically and internationally 
at december   million or percent of our trade accounts receivable are due from williams with the difference due from broadwing 
in february  williams announced that it is considering restructuring options  which may include filing a chapter bankruptcy case 
as of february   williams owes us approximately million 
if williams files for bankruptcy protection under chapter  we cannot be certain when we will receive these outstanding payments  and if we do  how much will actually be received 
in addition  there may be other provisions under bankruptcy laws that would impact our ability to collect these amounts and that may affect some payments that we have already received 
bankruptcy laws may also allow williams under certain circumstances  to reject the purchase agreement 
we cannot give any assurances or make any predictions as to whether williams will file for bankruptcy and what effect that  or any other decisions that they make  will have on our business 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements through at least the next twelve months 
if cash on hand and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing shareholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
increasingly  as a result of the financial demands of major network deployments  carriers are looking to their suppliers for financing assistance 
from time to time  we may provide or commit to extend credit or credit support to our customers as we consider appropriate in the course of our business 
algety telecom sa on july   we acquired algety telecom sa  a french company that develops and markets high capacity  high speed optical transmission equipment 
algety  based in lannion  france  was formed in april  and was a development stage company with no revenue 
at the initial closing on july   we delivered to the algety shareholders  shares of our series i convertible preferred stock  which converted into  shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering 
we also delivered  shares of series i convertible preferred stock to our escrow agent to secure potential warranty claims  which converted into  shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering 
in addition  we placed into escrow  shares of common stock that will be released contingent upon satisfaction of certain minimum employment terms for certain algety employees 
we incurred approximately million of transaction costs relating to the transaction 
on november   consistent with the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company completed a second closing in which an additional  shares of common stock were delivered to the former algety stockholders 
total value of all shares delivered in the first and second closings was million 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method whereby the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired of million  based upon the purchase price allocation  was being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
in addition  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and technology and was expensed immediately 
during  the company recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately million associated with the impairment of the goodwill 
under sfas  described below  the remaining balance of million will no longer be amortized on a straight line basis  but rather goodwill will be tested at least annually for impairment 
subsequent event on january   we announced that we had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire dorsal networks  inc  a privately held provider of next generation transoceanic and regional undersea optical network solutions 
subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions  including the approval by our shareholders and the shareholders of dorsal  we will acquire dorsal in a stock transaction for approximately  shares of common stock 
the shareholders meeting is expected to take place in the first half of the acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the purchase price of dorsal will be allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired from dorsal  with the excess being treated as goodwill 
we preliminarily estimate that the acquisition will result in an in process research and development charge of approximately million as well as the recognition of certain intangible assets of million  which will be amortized over an estimated life of five years 
in addition  the acquisition will result in goodwill of approximately million  which will have an indefinite life  but will be subject to periodic impairment tests 
dr 
david r 
huber  our president and chief executive officer  owns  directly or indirectly  approximately percent of the outstanding stock of dorsal 
effective upon the completion of the dorsal transaction  jim bannantine  the current president and ceo or dorsal networks  will become the new president of corvis corporation  responsible for the day to day operations of the company 
prior to completion of the dorsal merger  jim will lead the transition and integration planning efforts for both companies

the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
factors that may affect our future results risks related to our financial results we have incurred significant losses since inception  and we expect losses to continue in the future 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion 
we expect to incur significant losses in the near term 
we cannot be certain that we will ever achieve profitability 
we will need to generate significant revenue and control costs to achieve profitability 
our limited operating history makes financial forecasting and evaluation of our business difficult 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
we have only a limited history selling our optical network products 
although we began operations in  we began generating revenue in the second half of because we have a limited history upon which to base forecasts of future operating results  you should not rely on our past financial performance to evaluate our future financial performance and any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer  more stable business history 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenue and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate 
the primary factors that may affect our quarterly results include the following 
loss of customers or the ability to attract new customers  
satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria  
cancellation of or delays in customer orders  
demand for optical networking products and services  
the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products and services  
the timing and size of sales of our products and services  
our ability to maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products and services  
our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components  
changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  
increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  
new product introductions and enhancements by our competitors  
our ability to develop  introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner  
the timing and magnitude of product development expenses  
our ability to attract and retain key personnel  
issuances or sales by us of common stock or other securities in the future  
costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and 
general economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications and related industries 
a delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
it is possible that in some future quarters our results may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
certain of our products are designed to enable all optical transmission and switching of data traffic over long distances 
we expect that customers who purchase these products will do so as part of a large scale deployment of these products across their networks 
we also offer point to point solutions which we expect to be purchased by customers to cover high traffic routes 
in each case  a customer s decision to purchase our all optical network products will involve a significant commitment of its resources 
a lengthy testing and product qualification process  a portion of which is funded by us  will precede any final decision to purchase our products 
throughout this sales and qualification cycle  we will spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the uses and features of our products 
the timing of deployment of our products may vary widely and will depend on the specific network deployment plan of the customer  the installation skills of the customer  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary 
customers with substantial or complex networks have traditionally expanded their networks or upgraded their systems in large increments on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis 
in addition  customers may request the cancellation of purchase orders 
because of our limited operating history and the nature of our business  we cannot predict the timing or size of these sales and deployment cycles 
long sales cycles  as well as our expectation that customers will tend to place large orders sporadically with short lead times  may cause our revenue and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
we currently have five customers and we expect that substantially all of our revenue will be generated from a limited number of customers 
the target customers for our products are carriers that operate communications networks 
there are only a limited number of potential customers in our target markets 
we currently have five customers who have signed agreements to purchase our products 
each of these agreements contains significant obligations  the breach of which could result in termination of the agreement 
qwest communications corporation has agreed to purchase million of our products  some of which are currently under development  over a two year period beginning on the date that the products meet agreed technical requirements 
qwest s purchase obligations are also subject to our products being priced competitively 
although our agreement with qwest anticipated technical acceptance by december   qwest s testing of our equipment in its labs is ongoing 
recently qwest terminated a million purchase order that it had issued to us under this agreement in april we expect to continue with further testing and product enhancements to meet qwest s unique specifications for its network 
we are currently in discussions with qwest to modify the terms of the agreement to permit ongoing testing and further product development these discussions are also likely to involve modifications to the agreement regarding network deployment schedules and purchase level obligations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully agree to modified terms  or if we do  whether the new terms will include minimum purchase obligations 
if we are able to agree on these modifications  it is likely that the agreement would provide qwest with the ability to terminate if  among other circumstances  corvis products do not meet the new technical requirements 
we expect that any new terms will be agreed to by march  and if new terms are not agreed to by that date  it is likely that the agreement will terminate 
at december   million or percent of our trade accounts receivable are due from williams  with the balance due from broadwing 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  williams has paid us approximately million of the december  accounts receivable as it became due 
at december   all amounts due from williams were current and  based on our historical collections from williams and all publicly available financial information  we determined that no allowance for uncollectible amounts was necessary 
subsequent to year end  williams has disclosed certain recent events that may potentially adversely affect its financial condition 
based on these events  in late february  williams announced that it is considering restructuring options  which may include filing a petition for chapter bankruptcy protection 
if williams files for bankruptcy protection under chapter  we cannot be certain when we will receive these outstanding payments  and if we do  how much will actually be received 
in addition  there may be other provisions under bankruptcy laws that would impact our ability to collect these amounts and that may affect some payments that we have already received 
bankruptcy laws may also allow williams  under certain circumstances  to reject purchase agreement with us 
we cannot give any assurances or make any predictions as to whether williams will file for bankruptcy and what effect that  or any other decisions that they make  will have on our business 
we expect that in the future substantially all of our revenue will depend on sales of our optical network products to a limited number of potential customers 
the rate at which customers purchase products from us will depend  in part  on the increasing demand for bandwidth by carriers customers 
any failure of carriers to purchase products from us for any reason  including any downturn in their business  may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  manufacturing  operations  sales  marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  including dr 
david huber  our founder  president and chief executive officer  could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have significant experience in international markets and may have unexpected costs and difficulties in developing international revenue 
we plan to expand the marketing and sales of our products internationally 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop international sales and support channels 
we have developed a sales and marketing staff outside of the united states 
international operations may be subject to certain risks and challenges that could harm our results of operations  including 
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  
longer sales cycles for our products  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights  
difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  
longer sales cycles for our products  
compliance with international standards that differ from domestic standards  
political and economic instability  
fluctuations in exchange rates  
changes in regulatory requirements in the communications industry  
expenses associated with developing and customizing our products for foreign countries  
tariffs  quotas and other import restrictions on communications products  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
risks related to the industry our business has been adversely affected by recent developments in the communications industry and the economy in general 
for much of the last five years the market for our equipment has been influenced by the entry into the communications services business of a substantial number of new companies 
in the united states that was due largely to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in new equipment  causing an acceleration in the growth of the market for telecommunications equipment 
recently  we have seen a reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
this  in turn  has caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy  but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
the combination of these factors has caused customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is both reduced in absolute size and more difficult to predict and plan for 
we expect the factors described above to affect our business  for at least several more quarters  if not longer  in several significant ways compared to the recent past 
it is likely that our markets will be characterized by reduced capital expenditures by our customers  and 
our ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales will be substantially reduced 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers 
industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers and potential customers 
to sell to some of these customers  we may be required to extend favorable payment terms 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have provided extended credit terms to some of our customers 
while we have done only a limited amount of this type of financing in the past  the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate may require us to engage in more competitive financing arrangements 
our ability to recognize revenue from financed sales will depend on the relative financial condition of the specific customer  among other factors 
any change in the financial condition of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for optical networking products are evolving and uncertain and our business will suffer if they do not develop as we expect 
most carriers have made substantial investments in their current network infrastructure  and may have announced significant reductions in their capital expenditures 
it is uncertain when these reductions in capital expenditures will be reversed 
in addition  carriers may elect to remain with current network architectures or to adopt new architectures in limited stages or over extended periods of time 
a decision by a customer to purchase our optical networking solutions will involve a significant capital investment 
we will need to convince these carriers of the benefits of our solutions for future network deployment 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will further develop or be sustainable 
if this market does not develop further  or develops more slowly than we expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
competition in optical networking markets is intense 
these markets have historically been dominated by large companies  such as alcatel  cisco  lucent  nec and nortel 
we may face competition from other large communications equipment companies that are currently in or that may enter our market 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new all optical products to address the same network needs that our products address 
due to several factors including the lengthy sales cycle  testing and deployment process and manufacturing constraints associated with large scale deployments of our products  we may lose any advantage that we might have by being an early provider of all optical network products prior to achieving market penetration 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more vendor financing than we can 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that compete with our products or render our products obsolete 
due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter our markets  further intensifying competition 
in order to compete effectively  we must deliver products that 
provide high reliability  
provide an overall cost effective solution for carriers  
reduce operating costs  
increase network capability easily and efficiently with minimal disruption  
operate with existing equipment and network designs  
reduce the complexity of the network in which they are installed by decreasing the amount of equipment required  and 
provide effective network management 
in addition  we believe that a knowledge of the infrastructure requirements applicable to carriers  experience in working with carriers to develop new services for their customers  and an ability to provide vendor financing are important competitive factors in our market 
we have limited knowledge of carriers infrastructure requirements and limited experience in working with carriers to develop new services 
we currently provide only a limited vendor sponsored financing program 
many of our competitors  however  are able to offer more complete financing programs  which may influence prospective customers to purchase from our competitors rather than from us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  we may have difficulty obtaining customers  and could experience price reductions  order cancellations  increased expenses and reduced gross margins  any one of which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the communications industry is subject to government regulations that could harm our business 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry and  as a result  our products and our customers products are subject to fcc rules and regulations 
current and future fcc rules and regulations affecting communications services  our products or our customers businesses or products could negatively affect our business 
in addition  international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international carriers in the future 
delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may  in the future  be required to operate our business 
risks related to product manufacturing we have limited manufacturing experience and unproven manufacturing capabilities 
if we are unable to adjust our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or if we do not accurately project demand  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and manufacture our products cost effectively 
to do so  we will have to develop manufacturing processes that will allow us to produce sufficient quantities of products at competitive prices 
we have limited manufacturing experience and have only used our current facilities for limited quantities of commercial products 
due to the complexities of the optical product manufacturing process  we may not be able to supplement our internal manufacturing capability by outsourcing manufacturing of our products to meet demand 
if we are unable to adjust our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or if we do not accurately project demand  we will have insufficient capacity or excess capacity  either of which will seriously harm our business 
there are numerous risks associated with adjusting manufacturing capabilities  including the following 
the inability to purchase and install the necessary manufacturing equipment  
the scarcity and cost of manufacturing personnel  
difficulties in achieving adequate yields from new manufacturing lines  and 
the scarcity and cost of certain components 
our manufacturing facilities and related capital expenditures assume a level of customer orders that we may not realize or  if we do realize  may not be sustained over multiple quarters 
if we do not receive anticipated levels of customer orders  our gross margins will decline and we will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly enough to prevent a decline in our operating results 
we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components 
if we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will be unable to meet our customers product delivery requirements  which would harm our business 
we currently purchase several key components from single or limited sources 
from time to time  there have been industry wide shortages of some optical components 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers experiences capacity constraints  work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output  they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule 
our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  be acquired by our competitors  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their products from their suppliers  and we may be unable to develop alternative sources for the components 
even if alternate suppliers are available  identifying them is often difficult and time consuming 
we have key components that are available from only one qualified supplier 
the process of qualifying vendors can take a significant amount of time and is not always successful 
if we do not qualify multiple vendors or receive critical components in a timely manner  we will be unable to manufacture our products in a timely manner and would  therefore  be unable to meet customers product delivery requirements 
any failure to meet a customer s delivery requirements could harm our reputation and decrease our sales  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our competitors are also our suppliers and if our supply relationship with them deteriorates  it could harm our business 
some of our component suppliers are both our primary source for those components and major competitors in the market for communications equipment 
for example  we buy some of our key components from lucent and alcatel  each of which offers communications systems and equipment that compete with our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if these supply relationships were to change in any manner adverse to us 
risks related to our products because optical networking products are complex and are deployed in complex environments  our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment  which could seriously harm our business 
optical products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks 
because of the nature of the products  they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic 
our customers may discover errors or defects in the hardware or the software  or our products may not operate as expected  after they have been fully deployed 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems that may be identified in full deployment  we would experience 
loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  
loss of existing customers  
failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  
diversion of development resources  
increased service and warranty costs  
legal actions by our customers  and 
increased insurance costs 
the occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could negatively affect market acceptance for our products 
our customers could also seek damages for losses from us  which  if the customers were successful  would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly and would put a strain on our management and resources 
our business will suffer if we do not respond rapidly to technological changes 
the market for network communications equipment is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements 
we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
the constant introduction of new products by competitors  market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards has led to significant inventory write downs and could render our existing or future products obsolete  which may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in developing our products  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions about the industry standards that may be adopted by our competitors and potential customers 
if the standards adopted are different from those that we have chosen to support  market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or delayed and our business will be seriously harmed 
in addition  the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete 
in order to introduce products incorporating new technologies and new industry standards  we must be able to gain access to the latest technologies of our suppliers  other network vendors and our potential customers 
any failure to gain access to the latest technologies may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will suffer if our current and future products do not meet specific customer requirements 
customers may require product features and capabilities that our products do not have 
to achieve market acceptance for our products  we must anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands 
our failure to develop products or offer services that satisfy customer requirements may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to continue to invest in product and technology development 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older to newer products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
our inability to effectively manage this transition may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third party challenges 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute and in the future we may become involved in similar disputes  which could subject us to significant liability  divert the time and attention of our management and prevent us from selling our products 
on july   ciena filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging that we are willfully infringing three of ciena s patents 
ciena is seeking injunctive relief  monetary damages including treble damages  as well as costs of the lawsuit  including attorneys fees 
on september   we filed an answer to the complaint  as well as counter claims alleging  among other things  invalidity and or unenforceability of the three patents in question 
on march   a motion was granted  allowing ciena to amend its complaint to include allegations that we are willfully infringing two additional patents 
we are currently in the pre trial phase of the litigation and a trial date had originally been set for april   however  it has recently been postponed by the court 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these claims 
an adverse determination in  or settlement of  the ciena litigation could involve the payment of significant amounts by us  or could include terms in addition to payments  such as an injunction  preventing us from selling some of our products until we are able to implement a non infringing design to any portion of our products to which such determination applied 
an adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are required to redesign our products  we may have to stop selling our current products until they have been redesigned 
we believe that defense of the lawsuit may be costly and may divert the time and attention of some members of our management 
we or our customers may be a party to additional litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or to respond to allegations that we infringe others intellectual property 
any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers against the alleged infringement 
if we are unsuccessful in any intellectual property litigation  we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights 
intellectual property litigation  regardless of its success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
in addition  we could be forced to do one or more of the following 
stop selling  incorporating or using products that include the challenged intellectual property  
obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or 
redesign those products that use the technology  which may be time consuming or impossible 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our business would be seriously harmed 
we currently license technology  and from time to time we may be required to license additional technology  from third parties to sell or develop our products and product enhancements 
our existing and future third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to maintain or obtain any third party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the development of our business our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key individuals within our prospective customers organizations 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop and manage these relationships 
this effort requires specialized sales personnel as well as experienced sales engineers 
competition for these individuals is intense because there are a limited number of people available with the necessary business background and understanding of our market 
when we hire them or contract for these personnel  they may require extensive training in our network products 
we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel and sales engineers required for us to be successful 
if we are unable to adjust our sales  customer service and support operations  we may not be able to effectively market our products  which may prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
we have previously offered warrants to purchase our common stock to three of our customers 
we may be unable to attract new customers unless we continue to offer similar equity arrangements 
two of our customers purchased an equity interest in us  and a third customer holds a warrant to purchase our common stock 
although these customers purchased the equity interests at fair value and the warrant has an exercise price equal to the fair value on the date of grant  the opportunity to invest in us provided these customers with an additional incentive to purchase our products 
we may be unable to attract new customers  unless we offer equity to them 
it is not our intention to offer equity to customers in the future 
our business will suffer if we fail to properly manage our size and continually improve our internal controls and systems 
we continue to adjust the scope of our operations  as well as our in house manufacturing and customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels and fund research and development 
our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
in order to manage our size properly  we must 
retain existing personnel  
hire  train  manage and retain additional qualified personnel  including engineers and research and development personnel  
manage our manufacturing operations  controls and reporting systems  
effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties  and 
implement additional operational controls  reporting and financial systems and procedures 
failure to do any of the above in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or management s attention could be diverted away from our operations 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have received claims of this kind in the past  and we may receive claims of this kind in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel or that those claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in addition  defending ourselves from such claims could divert the attention of management away from our operations 
we may need additional capital to fund our existing and future operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing and sales efforts  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development  marketing and sales of new products is expected to require a significant commitment of resources 
we may incur significant operating losses or expend significant amounts of capital if 
the market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated  
we fail to establish market share or generate revenue  
our capital expenditure forecasts change or prove inaccurate  and 
we need to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
as a result  we may need to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing and sales efforts  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the dorsal acquisition 
we may not realize any benefits from the merger 
although there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed  we and dorsal entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger will result in benefits to each company  including 
significantly broadening our addressable market opportunities  
positioning us as one of the few end to end vendors of next generation terrestrial and undersea optical networking solutions  
accelerating sales to global carriers  
leveraging the two companies complementary technologies and enhancing their competitive strengths  
leveraging both companies sales and marketing resources to provide opportunities to increase market penetration and revenue growth  
realizing cost savings in operations and new product development  
addressing an attractive market opportunity in light of the current competitive landscape and compared to other areas of potential acquisition for us in the terrestrial space  
expanding new product development opportunities through the integration of existing products and services  
having greater capacity to respond to competition  market demands and technological change  and 
increasing management breadth and depth 
achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the successful integration of our and dorsal s operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner 
integrating corvis and dorsal will be a complex and time consuming process 
employees and management of each of corvis and dorsal have played a key role in creating each company 
the successful integration of these two companies will alter prior relationships and may affect productivity 
in addition  the merger is likely to divert the attention of management of each company and could negatively affect the combined company s ability to operate and retain key employees after the merger 
we cannot assure you that the operations of the companies can be successfully integrated or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and common stock price 
if we and dorsal cannot quickly and efficiently make our technology  products and services operate together  many of the potential benefits of the merger may not be realized 
we intend to make dorsal s technology  products and services operate together with our own products and services  as well as to offer dorsal s technology  products and services separately 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so quickly and effectively 
in order to obtain the benefits of the merger  we must make dorsal s technology  products and services operate together with our technology  products and services 
we may be required to spend additional time and money on integration  which would otherwise be spent on developing our own products and services 
if we do not integrate the technology effectively or if our management spends too much time on integration issues  it could harm the combined company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
merger related accounting charges may delay and reduce our profitability 
we will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the purchase price of dorsal will be allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired from dorsal with any excess being treated as goodwill 
as a result  we will incur accounting charges from the merger that may delay our profitability 
these charges are currently preliminarily estimated to include an in process research and development charge of approximately million to be expensed in the period in which the merger is consummated 
in addition  the merger will generate certain intangible assets of approximately million which will be amortized over varying periods and estimated goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives of approximately million  which will be subject to periodic impairment tests and could result in potential write down charges in future periods 
these estimates may change based on a final independent valuation 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger 
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger if 
the integration of corvis and dorsal is unsuccessful or takes longer than expected  
the perceived benefits of the merger are not achieved as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors  
the effect of the merger on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors  or 
dilution from the stock issued for the merger 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
we maintain instruments subject to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we categorize all of our market risk sensitive instruments as non trading or other instruments 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities including commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
substantially all amounts are in money market funds as well as high grade  short term commercial paper and certificates of deposit  the value of which is generally not subject to interest rate changes 
we believe that a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income or cash flows 
our long term debt obligations bear fixed interest rates 
as such  we have minimal cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes associated with our long term debt obligations 
foreign rate sensitivity we primarily operate in the united states  however  we have expanded operations to include research and development and sales offices in various european countries 
as a result  we may have sales in foreign currencies exposing us to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded no sales in a foreign currency 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency changes  associated with the euro  for our european subsidiaries  financial instruments  which are limited to cash and cash equivalents 
it is the policy of management to fund foreign operations on a monthly basis  thus minimizing average cash and overnight investments in the euro 
at december   our european subsidiaries maintained cash and cash equivalents of approximately euro million 
we believe that a increase or decline in the euro exchange ratio would not be material to cash and cash equivalent balances  interest income  or cash flows from consolidated operations
