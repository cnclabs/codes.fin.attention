item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  market and support software infrastructure and application service provider asp services for live elearning and real time business collaboration 
our enterprise products provide a comprehensive range of knowledge delivery and services which include features such as voice over the internet  software application sharing  real time data exchange  shared workspaces  record and playback  and standards compliant content management and monitoring 
our products to date have been sold primarily to global businesses and have consisted of product offerings and network service solutions for corporate elearning and training  collaborative sales and marketing  and one to one customer  partner and employee relationships 
on april   we acquired mindlever 
com  inc mindlever  a provider of management systems for learning content  for million in cash and  shares of common stock valued at approximately million  plus acquisition costs in the approximate amount of  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with apb no 
accordingly  the results of operations of mindlever have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
through december   our revenues were derived from licenses of our software products  from related maintenance  and from the delivery of implementation consulting  training  hosting and asp services 
we price the license of our enterprise application software on a rental or purchase basis under a variety of licensing models  including perpetual named user licenses  perpetual concurrent user licenses  time limited licenses and revenue sharing 
customers who license our enterprise application software typically purchase renewable maintenance contracts that provide telephone support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis over a stated term  usually a twelve month period 
maintenance is priced as a percentage of our license fees 
we also offer implementation consulting  training  and education services to our customers  primarily on a time and materials basis  but also for education  on a course subscription or per course basis 
in addition  we offer hosting services for customers under hosting agreements  with terms typically ranging from six to twelve months  to outsource the administration and infrastructure necessary to operate our enterprise application software 
the hosting fees include a set up fee and a monthly service fee  in addition to license fees for the software 
finally  we offer all of our licensed products as an asp service  with terms typically ranging from three to twelve months 
the asp service fees include a set up fee and monthly  hourly or per event subscription fee 
centra executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license  maintenance arrangement and other services arrangements 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  is allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
centra uses the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized 
centra has established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence for the value of its consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with consulting  training  and other services 
revenues from license fees are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the products are shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met 
centra s products do not require significant customization 
billings to customers are generally due within days of the invoice date 
the company has offered extended payment terms greater than days but less than months to certain of its customers for which license revenue is recognized upon shipment 
these customers are well capitalized and typically have entered into enterprise wide license arrangements with the company 
the company believes that it has sufficient history of collecting all amounts due within the stated terms under these types of arrangements to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time license revenues are recognized 
revenues related to maintenance and software application hosting are recognized on a straight line basis over the period that the maintenance and hosting services are provided 
revenues related to asp services are recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period that the asp services are provided  or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
revenues allocable to implementation  consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period  or upon completing project milestones if defined in the agreement 
we record as deferred revenues any billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenues recognized 
deferred revenue at december  consisted primarily of deferred contract maintenance  deferred asp services  deferred consulting services  deferred license revenue  deferred hosting services and deferred education services 
we sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force and through relationships with distributors  resellers and other strategic partners 
we have established european direct sales and service operations headquartered in the united kingdom and have master distributors in japan and korea 
in addition  we have value added resellers throughout europe  the middle east  the pacific rim  china  india  brazil and south africa 
revenues from sales outside of the united states were   and  or  and of our total revenues for  and  respectively 
during  and  we have invested in the infrastructure necessary to expand our global operations  including the formation and staffing of our european subsidiaries and our asian operations 
we expect to continue to invest in our international operations as we expand our international direct and indirect channels and enhance our marketing efforts to increase worldwide market share 
we anticipate that revenues derived from outside the united states will increase both in terms of percentage of revenues and absolute dollars 
our cost of license revenues includes royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  as well as costs of product documentation  media used to deliver our products  and fulfillment 
our cost of service revenues includes a salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education  technical support and information technology services organizations  b an overhead allocation consisting primarily of that portion of our facilities  communications and depreciation expenses that is attributable to providing our services  and c direct costs related to our hosting and asp service offerings 
our operating expenses are classified into six general categories sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  compensation charge for issuance of stock options  acquired in process research and development  and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of a salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel and b costs associated with marketing programs  including trade shows and seminars  advertising  public relations activities and new product launches 

product development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  fees for outside consultants and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  purchase of third party source code  quality assurance  testing  documentation and third party localization costs 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  financial  administrative and information technology personnel  as well as outside accounting  legal  investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company 

compensation charge for issuance of stock options represents the amortization  over the vesting period of the option  of the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees and the deemed fair market value of the options for financial reporting purposes 

acquired in process research and development represents the cost of incomplete research and development projects acquired through the mindlever acquisition 
the cost is the estimated fair value of the research and development projects based on risk adjusted cash flows 
these costs were expensed as of the date of acquisition 

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets represents the amortization  over five and three year periods respectively  of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable tangible net assets acquired and the valuation of the developed technology and know how and assembled workforce 
in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  our software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant and all costs related to internal product development have been expensed as incurred 
our previously outstanding series a and series b preferred stock had participation rights that allowed holders to receive a premium equal to of their original investment upon redemption  liquidation or automatic conversion of the preferred stock into common stock 
for financial reporting purposes  we discounted the value of series a and series b preferred stock by the value of these participation rights 
prior to february  we had been increasing the carrying value of the series a and series b preferred stock for the liquidation premium and participation discount through charges to stockholders deficit over the redemption period 
this increase is also reflected in the accretion of discount on preferred stock in our statement of operations 
upon the automatic conversion of the series a and series b preferred stock into common stock in february   in unamortized liquidation premium and participation discount on the series a and series b preferred stock was accreted 
we have experienced substantial losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and our accumulated deficit have resulted from our initial lack of substantial revenues  as well as the significant costs incurred in the development of our products and services and in the preliminary establishment of our infrastructure 
we expect to increase our expenditures in all areas in order to execute our business plan  and to expand further internationally  particularly in sales and marketing 
the planned increase in sales and marketing expense will result principally from the hiring of additional sales force personnel and from marketing programs to maintain brand awareness 
accordingly  we expect to experience additional losses during although we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods  our recent rate of revenue growth may not be sustainable 
we may not be able to continue to increase our revenues or to attain profitability and  if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain profitability for any period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future financial performance 
see factors that may affect future results below

we anticipate that the cost of services revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars to the extent that we continue to generate new customers and associated services revenues and continue to expand our asp service business

in conjunction with our acquisition of mindlever  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects

accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the date of acquisition

total cost of revenues also have generally increased in absolute dollars over the periods presented due to increased royalty costs resulting from increased revenues and an increase in the number of professional services personnel 
operating expenses have experienced significant variations from quarter to quarter primarily as the result of the timing and number of additions of personnel and related compensation costs for sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  variations in sales and marketing are also related to the timing  number and significance of specific marketing activities  such as advertising  trade shows  product launches and other promotional activities 
operating expenses will continue to increase as we grow our infrastructure to support our expanding operations 
liquidity and capital resources on february   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock

amounts outstanding are payable in equal monthly installments beginning on october  additionally at december   centra had outstanding borrowings under the original equipment line of credit of  bearing interest at prime rate plus per annum 
all borrowings are secured by substantially all of centra s assets

purchases of computer equipment represent the largest component of our capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures to continue for the foreseeable future as we increase our number of employees  increase the size of our operating facilities  increase our asp service infrastructure and improve and expand our information systems

however  thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds to support more rapid expansion of our sales force  develop new or enhanced products or services  respond to competitive pressures  or acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if we seek to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain funds on terms which are favorable or acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  the securities could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock

under the merger agreement  holders of our common stock will receive smartforce american depositary shares adss for each share of our common stock outstanding at the time of the merger 
the merger  which is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of  is subject to certain conditions including the approval of the merger by our stockholders and the approval by smartforce s shareholders of the issuance of smartforce adss in the merger

factors that could affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report relating to management s expectations concerning our future results of operations and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
centra disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information or future events or otherwise 
except as otherwise expressly stated  forward looking statements contained in this report assume that we will continue to operate as an independent company and do not give effect to our proposed merger with smartforce public limited company  described under subsequent event on page consummation of the proposed merger with smartforce will cause our business plans and our results to differ in material respects from those indicated in the forward looking statements appearing herein 
important factors that may cause our actual results to differ from the forward looking statements described above include  but are not limited to  the following factors discussed below 
risks related to the proposed merger with smartforce failure to complete the merger with smartforce could damage our financial condition and our business 
if the merger with smartforce is not completed for any reason  we will be subject to a number of material risks  including 
the provision in the merger agreement which provides that under certain circumstances described in the merger agreement  we could be required to pay smartforce a termination fee in the amount of million  
costs related to the merger  such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking fees  must be paid even if the merger is not completed  
benefits that we expect to realize from the merger would not be realized  and 
the diversion of management attention from our day to day business and the unavoidable disruption to our employees and our relationships with customers and suppliers during the period before consummation of the merger may damage our competitive position and our business 
during the pendency of the merger  we may not be able to enter into a merger or business combination with another party that might be advantageous to us  because of restrictions in the merger agreement 
covenants in the merger agreement may impede our ability to make acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the merger 
as a result  if the merger is not consummated  we may be at a disadvantage to our competitors 
in addition  while the merger agreement is in effect and subject to narrowly defined exceptions  we are prohibited from soliciting  initiating  encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions  such as a merger  sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business with any third party 
as a result  we might be prevented from entering into transactions which might otherwise have been favorable to our stockholders 
we may lose key personnel  customers and business partners due to uncertainties associated with the merger 
pending the closing of the merger  our current and prospective employees  customers and business partners may experience uncertainty about their future relationships with the resulting combined company 
such uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
current and prospective customers and business partners may  in response to the announcement of the merger agreement  delay or cancel purchasing decisions 
any delay in  or cancellation of  purchasing decisions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
partners or customers may react unfavorably to the proposed combination 
we seek to enter relationships with numerous other technology companies  including software and services firms  to deliver our products and services to customers 
some of these partners may feel that the proposed merger poses new competitive threats to their businesses and as a result may discontinue their relationships with us 
in addition  some of our customers may view smartforce as a competitor to them and  therefore  terminate their relationships with us 
other risks our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
this makes it more difficult to predict our future financial performance  and increases the likelihood that our results for a particular quarter could fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our stock to drop rapidly and severely 
we have in the past experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and anticipate that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future 
as a result  it is likely that in one or more future quarters our results of operations will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  in october  we announced revenues for the quarter ended september  that were substantially lower than had been expected by the investment market 
as a result of this announcement  the trading price of our common stock declined approximately by the end of the following trading day 
our operating results have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including 
the evolution of the market for live elearning and business collaboration solutions  
market acceptance of our products and services  
our success and timing in developing and introducing new products and enhancements to existing products  
the introduction of products and services by our competitors  
changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  
the length of our sales cycle  
changes in customer buying patterns  and 
market entry by new competitors 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue increases 
as a result  any shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in increased quarterly losses 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
we began shipping our first product in july and began to provide our emeeting product as an asp service in june and our symposium and conference products as an asp service in october additionally  we began shipping our centra knowledge products in june our limited operating history may make it difficult for investors to evaluate our future prospects 
we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not achieve profitability in the future 
since we began operations  we have incurred substantial net losses in every fiscal period 
we cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all  and if we do  we may not remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the time frame expected by investors  the market price of our common stock may fall 
we had net losses of million in and million in and million in as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not sustain our growth or generate sufficient revenues to attain profitability 
our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
we have a long sales cycle because we generally need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of our live online elearning and business collaboration products and services prior to sale 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase and whether we have conducted business with a potential customer in the past 
potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization prior to making purchase decisions 
our long sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several months or more  makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenues and operating results for any particular period 
the development of a market for our live elearning and business collaboration products and services is uncertain 
the market for live elearning and business collaboration products and services is immature and rapidly evolving 
if the market for elearning and business collaboration solutions does not grow at the rate we expect  this will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as is typical for new and rapidly evolving industries  customer demand for recently introduced elearning and business collaboration products and services is highly uncertain 
we expect to depend on sales of our centra symposium tm solution for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that revenues from our centra symposium tm product and related services will continue to constitute a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  any decline in the demand for centra symposium tm would seriously harm our business 
we face significant competition from other technology companies and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for live elearning and collaboration solutions is immature  competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect that the intensity of our competition will increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our collaboration solution from a variety of software and services vendors 
in addition  bigger companies with more resources than we have could enter our market and either reduce our sales or require us to lower our prices  or both 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
some have significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
our success depends on our ability to expand our sales force and distribution channels 
to increase our revenues  we must increase the size of our sales force  the number of our indirect channel partners  including value added resellers and systems integrators and the number of our alliance partners  including technology  content and service providers 
as of december   our sales organization consisted of professionals 
we intend to increase our sales organization over the next twelve months 
however  there is competition for qualified sales personnel in our business  and we cannot assure that we will be successful in attracting  integrating  motivating and retaining new sales personnel 
our existing or future channel partners and alliance partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
in addition  we may face conflicts among our sales force and our channel and alliance partners 
our inability to increase our direct sales force and our number of indirect channel partners and alliance partners may limit our future revenue growth and hurt our future operating results 
if we lose the services of our chief executive officer  chief operating officer or any other member of our management team  our business could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skill  experience and efforts of leon navickas  our chief executive officer  anthony mark  our president and chief operating officer  and the other members of our management team 
the loss of any member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not have agreements with any of our executive officers which commit them to remain employed by us 
future regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of electronic commerce 
as commercial use of the internet increases  federal  state and foreign agencies could enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  such laws or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although they might not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws or rules regulating personal and consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
it is possible that such legislation or regulation could expose companies involved in e commerce to liability  which could limit the growth of web use and e commerce generally and thereby reduce demand for our products and services 
such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth in web usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce 
our failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could hurt our business 
our failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our products  our ability to retain key personnel  and on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth that has been placing a significant strain on all of our resources 
from january  to december   the number of our employees increased from to to manage our future growth  if any  effectively  we must continue to enhance our information technology infrastructure  financial and accounting systems  controls and personnel  integrate a significant number of new hires  and manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations 
in addition  we may need to identify and move to alternative facilities to accommodate our growth  which could disrupt our business and hurt our operating results 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and broaden our live elearning and business collaboration products and services to meet the evolving needs of the market 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions  and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbate these market characteristics 
to achieve our goals  we need to respond effectively to technological changes and new industry standards and developments 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the introduction of new products 
in addition  our product enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our products  services or information technology infrastructure to adapt to these changes  standards and developments 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we will face new business risks that we have not encountered previously 
in addition to our north american operations  we have established sales  marketing and service operations in europe and the pacific rim 
this expansion will require additional resources and management attention and will subject us to new regulatory  economic and political risks 
given our limited experience in international markets  we cannot be sure that our international expansion will be successful 
in addition  we will face new risks in doing business internationally 
these risks could reduce demand for our products and services  lower the prices at which we can sell our products and services  or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating results 
among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are 
longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  
adverse changes in trade and tax regulations  
the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  
the adoption of data privacy laws or regulations  
political and economic instability  and 
currency risks 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights  other companies might copy our technology and introduce products or services which compete with ours  without paying us for our technology 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our proprietary technology includes the centra r trademark  among others  and two patent applications  neither of which has been issued 
we depend upon a combination of patent and trademark laws  license agreements  non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary and distribution rights in our products 
in addition  we attempt to protect our proprietary information and those of our vendors and partners through confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  they may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  even if we were to prevail 
claims by other companies that we infringe their proprietary technology could force us to redesign our products or otherwise hurt our financial condition 
if we were to discover that any of our products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reengineer the product or to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  that would enable us to continue offering the product without substantial reengineering 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly developing technology environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products or cause our customers to stop using our products 
our business could be adversely affected if our products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs that result in product failures 
from time to time we have identified errors in our products after commercial introduction of the products 
while we have not been materially harmed by errors in the past  the occurrence of errors in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenues  loss of market share  diversion of product development resources  injury to our reputation or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products and services 
many of the business interactions supported by our products and services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other collaborative activity caused or allegedly caused by our products and services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
we may require additional funds 
we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to provide us with sufficient working capital for at least the next months 
however  our current plans and projections may prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flow may prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of product delays  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
therefore  we may need to raise additional capital in order to fund the development and marketing of our products and services 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest  particularly in business collaboration software companies 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  defer our product development activities  or delay our continued roll out of new products and product versions 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
our historical operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
because of the foregoing factors  our operating results are difficult to forecast 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful  and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
you should also evaluate our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable early stage companies in new and rapidly emerging markets 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address the risks and challenges that face us 
in addition  although we have experienced significant revenue growth recently  we cannot assure you that our revenues will continue to grow or that we will become or remain profitable in the future 
we may not successfully integrate the technologies and or personnel of mindlever 
com  inc or any other entity that we acquire in the future and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions 
on april   we acquired mindlever 
com  inc there can be no assurance that the integration of all of the acquired technologies will be successful or will not result in unforeseen difficulties that may absorb significant management attention 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses or product lines 
the recently completed acquisition  or any future acquisition  may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as expected 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which we might otherwise devote to our existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
if we pursue a future acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort identifying and completing the acquisition 
if we make a future acquisition  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  incur a one time charge or be required to amortize goodwill  or any combination of the foregoing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since some of our sales are currently priced in us dollars and translated to local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly since our investments are in short term instruments and our long term debt and available line of credit require interest payments calculated at variable rates 
based on the nature and current levels of our investments and debt  however  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
in january  we liquidated certain short term debt obligations of california based electric utilities when their ratings dropped to below investment grade  which resulted in a realized loss of approximately  our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to seek to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we currently use a registered investment manager to place our investments in highly liquid money market accounts and government backed securities 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents
