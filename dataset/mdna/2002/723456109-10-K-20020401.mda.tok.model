risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   one should carefully consider the following factors 
all of the company s properties are dependent upon retaining existing and attracting new customers within their respective geographical markets 
the company is continually developing new and different marketing programs to retain existing and attract new customers to its properties 
such programs include mailing coupons and other direct mail offers to customers  providing complimentary rooms  food and beverage based on the amount wagered in the casino to frequent players  sponsoring gaming tournaments that provide significant rewards to the winners  and other offers that both provide incentives to existing customers and attract new customers 
the cost of such programs can be significant and can reduce the overall profitability of the specific location and the company as a whole 
in addition  certain programs may not generate incremental revenue if the customer merely takes advantage of the marketing program for the short term and does not become a frequent customer 
in addition to competing with other gaming operators in the various markets the company operates  the company is competing for customers  and their available discretionary spending resources  with other entertainment and leisure companies and attractions 
such companies and attractions may also offer rewards and incentives that would reduce the number of visits to and or the amount spent by new and existing customers at the company s properties 
finally  further terrorist attacks on the united states or its interests  such as that of september   could have a material adverse effect on the desire of existing and future customers to want to travel and frequent the company s facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract a sufficient number of customers necessary to make its operations profitable 
the company faces intense competition in all the markets which it operates 
see item description of business competition for a description of competition faced by the company 
loss of land based  riverboat or dockside facilities from service would adversely affect the company s operations 
the company s riverboat and dockside gaming facilities in indiana  louisiana and mississippi  as well as any additional riverboat casino properties that might be developed or acquired  are subject to risks in addition to those associated with land based casinos  including loss of service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  flood  hurricane  snow and ice storms or other severe weather conditions 
for cruising riverboats there are additional risks associated with the movement of vessels on waterways  including risks of casualty due to river turbulence and severe weather conditions 
in addition  the company s boomtown reno  nevada facility is subject to severe winter weather conditions that can cause the closure of interstate and reduce the amount of customers visiting the property 
finally  the company s casino magic argentina operation is subject to continued political and economic instability 
in july  the miss belterra was struck by a barge while en route to vevay  indiana 
the incident caused the opening of the belterra casino resort to be delayed from august to october there can be no assurance that the company s water based facilities will not be struck by other vessels while on the waterways 
in september  a hurricane struck the gulf coast region and boomtown biloxi  boomtown new orleans  casino magic biloxi  and casino magic bay st 
louis were forced to shut down operations for approximately one week  though none of the properties sustained significant damage 
if any of the company s casinos  be it riverboat  dockside or land based  cease operations for any period of time  it could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although the company carries property and business interruption insurance for these types of items  there can be no assurances similar  or other  events will not occur in the future that could cause the loss of service of the company s facilities 
the substantial amount of debt of the company could materially adversely affect the company s business 
as of december   the company had  of debt  including  of unsecured notes due february and  of unsecured notes due august see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  cash flow to service the company s debt was  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  including  related to the and notes 
while the company currently believes that there are sufficient cash and cash generating resources to meet its debt service obligations during the next year  there can be no assurance that in the future the company will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or through asset sales to meet its long term debt service obligations 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
such debt and the related debt service obligations could have important adverse consequences to the company  including but not limited to a limiting the company s ability to obtain additional financing  b requiring a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations to be used for payments on the debt and related interest  c reducing the company s ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements  d limiting the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the business and the industry  and  e restricting the company s activities compared to those of competitors with less debt or greater resources 
limited operating history at the belterra casino resort does not allow the company to effectively measure various improvements the company has implemented at the facility 
the belterra casino resort opened in october and  through december   has generated a net loss in excess of  including an ebitda loss in excess of  see item selected financial data for a definition of ebitda 
the company attributes the poor performance to  among other things a a location that is not easily accessible from local interstate freeways  b over staffing in anticipation of higher revenue and a greater number of customers frequenting the property than did in fact visit the facility  c additional marketing costs to promote the facility which is customary for new gaming facilities  d opening the property in october  which is traditionally the slowest period of the year  and e severe winter weather conditions in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of in an attempt to improve the overall financial performance of the facility  during the fourth quarter of  the company undertook an aggressive cost containment program at the property  including reducing the property s labor levels including management positions to be more consistent with its business levels  eliminating certain marketing programs and reducing operating costs by eliminating and or combining certain operations 
in addition  changes were made in the casino  including the slot machine mix  to become more appealing to the customer 
results of these efforts appear to be positive  however  there can be no assurances such actions will materially improve the long term profitability of the belterra casino resort 
in addition  there is currently planned the construction of a mile roadway from interstate  a main thoroughfare in northern kentucky  to the ohio river  which ending point would be approximately mile from the belterra casino resort 
it is anticipated the construction would begin in and be completed in the cost of the construction is to be borne by the state of kentucky  which currently has the funds set aside for such construction 
in the event the construction is completed  the company believes this roadway will improve access to its facility  however  there can be no assurances the roadway will be constructed  and if constructed  that such roadway would materially increase the number of customers visiting the belterra casino resort  and therefore improve the financial results of the property 
development of the lake charles project could exhaust all of the company s available capital and not provide for a sufficient return 
the company has been selected to receive the fifteenth and final gaming license for a proposed project in lake charles  louisiana 
issuance of the license is subject to a number of conditions  which conditions were finalized by the company and the gaming control board in november the lake charles conditions 
the lake charles conditions include  but are not limited to  the approval of the voters of calcasieu parish  where the lake charles project is located  currently scheduled for april  there are no assurances such referendum will not be delayed beyond april  and if held  that it will pass 
in addition to the april  calcasieu parish vote noted above  other lake charles conditions include  but are not limited to  building a facility consistent with the july presentation  meeting certain construction milestone dates and satisfying the financing requirements to complete the project including segregating  in a refundable escrow account upon the voter approval of the project in calcasieu parish and demonstrating the company has available financial resources in cash and credit facility access for the full project amount of  once construction commences 
construction is scheduled to commence in late the company anticipates it will continue to meet each of the lake charles conditions  however there can be no assurances the company will do so  in which event the company would not be licensed to operate a casino in lake charles  louisiana 
the proposed project is the construction and operation of a  excluding capitalized interest dockside riverboat casino  hotel and golf course resort complex in lake charles  louisiana 
the company is considering various financing options for the development of the proposed project and therefore compliance with the financing requirement of the lake charles conditions  including  but not limited to  utilizing the company s existing credit facility see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  a new credit facility or other senior debt  leasing arrangements and joint venture arrangements 
in february  the governor of louisiana signed a compact with the jena band of choctaw indians the choctaw indians to allow for the development and operation of a land based casino in the city of vinton  louisiana which city is in calcasieu parish and is miles closer to houston  texas  the major marketing area for casinos in lake charles  than the company s proposed lake charles project 
in march  such compact was disapproved by the us department of the interior 
there can be no assurances the choctaw indians will not seek to amend the compact  negotiate a revised compact with the state of louisiana and seek to resubmit with the department of the interior 
in the event the choctaw indians are successful in obtaining the approval of the department of the interior for a new compact for their site in vinton  louisiana  the company believes such facility would have a material adverse effect upon the company s decision to develop it s proposed lake charles project 
in the absence of an additional indian gaming facility in calcasieu parish as one currently exists to the east of the company s proposed lake charles project  the company anticipates building a facility similar in design and scope to that of belterra casino resort 
in the event the company elects to proceed with the lake charles project  the capital required to complete the project is significant 
depending on the source of funding to develop the project credit facility  leasing arrangements  joint venture partner  etc  such capital requirement to the company may exhaust all available capital of the company 
there can be no assurance that  in the event the project is commenced  there will be sufficient capital for other business activities of the company 
in addition  there are risks that  once completed  the revenue generated from the new development is not sufficient to pay its expenses  and the company is required to infuse cash to pay its bills 
there can be no assurance such new facility will be able to cover its own cash flow requirements 
adverse regulatory changes or changes in the gaming environment in any of the jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
see item description of business government regulation and gaming issues and competition 
for more information on the potential factors which could affect the company s financial results  please see forward looking statements and factors affecting future operating results and review the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to apply significant judgment in defining the estimates and assumptions 
our accounting policies that require significant judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions include policies for insurance reserves  asset disposition reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset impairment and other reserves  valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  depreciable lives of various assets and the calculation of income tax liabilities 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience of the company  terms of various past and present agreements and contracts  industry trends  and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the estimates 
factors affecting future operating results goodwill amortization in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas no 
and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
which are effective july  and january   respectively  for the company see note goodwill to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  with the adoption of sfas no 
on january  earlier adoption is not permitted  goodwill is no longer amortized over its estimated useful life  which  for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company is in the process of completing its evaluation of the financial statement impact of adoption of sfas no 
and anticipates there will be an impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of related to its casino magic locations which unamortized goodwill was  as of december  see note goodwill to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 any such transition related impairment charge would be classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in addition  under the new rules  any future acquired intangible asset will be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
intangible assets with definitive lives will be amortized over their useful lives 
argentina during the second half of  the political and economic condition of argentina deteriorated  including an increase in the risk of being unable to repatriate funds out of the country  the fall of international reserves  continuous fiscal imbalance  and a decrease in the financial system deposits 
in december  these events culminated in the resignation of the then president of the country  the imposition of restrictions on cash withdrawals  the delaying of payment of wages to government employees  and the closing of the banking system from late december to early january in an effort to stabilize the country  the new government of argentina decided to devalue the argentine peso in early january which had been pegged to the us dollar for over ten years  as well as stop all transfers of us dollars out of the country 
as a result of the actions taken  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation sfas no 
 the company recorded a translation loss in a separate component of stockholders equity in the amount of  as of december  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   total assets of the company in argentina were  or less than of the company s consolidated assets 
the company anticipates the cumulative translation loss will fluctuate in the future based on changes in the currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the argentine peso 
in addition  the company reclassified the cash  maintained in argentina as restricted cash at december   until such time as the argentine government amends its position regarding transferring funds out of the country  as such cash can only be utilized by casino magic argentina and not by pinnacle entertainment or any of its other subsidiaries 
in february  the government authorized the central bank of argentina to review and approve transfers of cash after converting pesos to us dollars 
there is no assurance the central bank will continue to authorize such transfers for casino magic argentina 
the impact of these events to casino magic argentina include a significant reduction in revenue resulting from a decline in customer counts and lower discretionary spending by customers 
the company anticipates the economic instability will continue in and will therefore continue to adversely impact casino magic argentina operating results in belterra casino resort in october  the company opened the belterra casino resort located on acres adjacent to the ohio river in switzerland county  indiana  which is approximately miles southwest of downtown cincinnati  ohio 
the belterra casino resort features a story  room hotel  a cruising riverboat casino the miss belterra with  slot machines and table games  an hole tom fazio designed championship golf course  which opened in july  six restaurants  a  seat entertainment venue  a spa  retail areas and other amenities 
prior to august  the company owned a interest in the belterra casino resort  with the remaining held by a non voting local partner 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with the local partner whereby the local partner had the right to require the company to purchase  for a purchase price determined in accordance with the agreement  its entire ownership interest in the belterra casino resort at any time on or after january  a  deposit toward such ultimate purchase price was made by the company to the partner at that time 
in july  the local partner exercised the right to require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest held by the partner for approximately  as calculated in accordance with the agreement 
in august  the remaining payment of approximately  was made to the partner and the belterra casino resort is now wholly owned by the company 
legislation regarding dockside gaming in louisiana in march  the state legislature passed a law enabling riverboat casinos to remain dockside at all times and increased the gaming taxes paid to the state of louisiana from to of net gaming proceeds effective april  for the nine riverboats in the southern region of the state  including the company s boomtown new orleans property 
the gaming tax increase to of net gaming proceeds will be phased in over an approximately two year period for the riverboats operating in parishes bordering the red river  including the company s casino magic bossier city property 
the phase in included a increase on april   with another on each of april  and the company believes this change in the law will benefit its boomtown new orleans operations in the long term  as increased revenues are expected from casino patrons who will no longer be required to arrange their plans to coincide with a cruising schedule 
the company also believes the new legislation would benefit the proposed lake charles project see below  as it would enable the company to build a riverboat casino that would remain dockside at all times and thus compete more effectively with existing operators 
finally  during the nine months ended december   the company believes the increased gaming taxes had a negative impact at casino magic bossier city  as gaming was already being conducted on a dockside riverboat casino prior to the new legislation 
lake charles in november  the company filed an application for the fifteenth and final gaming license to be issued by the louisiana gaming control board the gaming control board 
in july  the company was one of three groups that presented their proposed projects to the gaming control board 
on october   the company was selected by the gaming control board to receive the license 
in connection with the application  pinnacle entertainment entered into an option agreement with the lake charles harbor and terminal district the district to lease acres of unimproved land from the district upon which such resort complex would be constructed 
the initial lease option was for a six month period ending january  with three six month renewal options all of which have been exercised  at a cost of  per six month renewal option 
in june and again in january  the district agreed to extend the option period for additional six month terms at a cost of  per six month term 
in the event the local referendum noted above is not held prior to the expiration of the current option extension  the company anticipates requesting an additional lease option extension from the district 
these lease option payments are expensed over the option periods 
if the lease option were exercised  the annual rental payment would be  with a maximum annual increase of  commencing upon opening of the facility 
the term of the lease would be for a total of up to years  with an initial term of years and six consecutive renewal options of years each 
the lease would require the company to develop certain on and off site improvements at the location 
all costs incurred by the company related to obtaining this license have been expensed as incurred 
assets held for sale assets held for sale of  at december  consist primarily of acres of surplus land in inglewood  california and the crystal park casino card club casino in compton  california see california card clubs below and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
assets held for sale at december  consist of the acres of surplus land 
the company is marketing the properties to prospective buyers 
california card clubs by california state law  a corporation may operate a gambling enterprise in california only if every officer  director and shareholder holds a state gambling license 
only or greater shareholders of a publicly traded racing association  however  must hold a state gambling license 
as a practical matter  therefore  public corporations that are not qualified racing associations may not operate gambling enterprises in california 
as a result  the hollywood park casino and crystal park casino  are leased to  and operated by  an unrelated third party 
in may  the california senate passed a bill  the effect of which would have been to permit the company to operate the hollywood park casino in inglewood  california  which was subsequently passed by the california state assembly 
the bill was vetoed by the governor of california in october therefore  the company anticipates leasing the hollywood park casino and the crystal park casino to the current operator for the foreseeable future 
in november  the operator of the crystal park casino requested  and the company granted  a reduction in rent to  per month from  per month  due to increased card club competition and the overall slowdown in the us economy 
in addition  in the fourth quarter  the company began aggressively seeking buyers for the facility  and accordingly  reclassified the assets as held for sale see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overall us economic conditions during the year ended december   the us economy experienced a significant economic slowdown 
these economic conditions were further impacted by the tragic events of september  the impact of these adverse conditions to the company s operations includes fewer guests visiting the properties and spending less while visiting 
the company developed cost control programs at its various locations  including labor and marketing spending reductions  and began implementing those programs in late at the various locations 
results of operations accounting for customer cash back loyalty programs in january  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue addressed in issue no

this eitf pronouncement requires that the cost of the cash back component of the company s customer loyalty programs be treated as a reduction in revenues

these costs were previously recorded as a casino expense

assets sold on august   the company completed the sale of casino magic bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi the mississippi casinos and on june   the company completed the sale of turf paradise see note to the notes to consolidate financial statements 
the results of operations of the mississippi casinos and turf paradise are included in the results of operations only until such respective dates

the increase in gaming revenues at boomtown new orleans is primarily attributed to increased coin in volume of slot play and resultant slot revenue in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
during  boomtown new orleans renovated the rd deck of its dockside riverboat casino and installed new slot machines  and built a new high limit table games area  as well as benefited from dockside legislation that became effective april   which no longer requires the customers to coordinate their schedules with the cruising times of the boat 
the decrease in gaming revenue at boomtown reno is primarily attributed to an overall reduction in customer volume for the year including a substantial reduction in september due to the adverse impact of september  to the reno market  combined with a reduction in guest spending while visiting the property although hotel occupancy and food covers were not substantially lower 
the decrease in casino magic bossier city gaming revenue is due primarily to lower guest counts  which translated into lower table game drop volume of table game play and slot coin in levels 
the reduced guests counts are due primarily to i increased competition from the opening of a new casino hotel in december and the opening of a new hotel tower at another competitor in january  ii severe winter rainfall in late february and early march  which flooded the first level of the property s multi level parking garage until mid may  and iii construction disruption to its casino operations from the installation of new slot machines 
the decrease in gaming revenue at casino magic argentina is primarily due to the economic and political instability that began in the third quarter of and culminated in december with the resignation of the then president of the country  the imposition of restrictions on cash withdrawals by its citizens and the delaying of payment of wages to government employees
