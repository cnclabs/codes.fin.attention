table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
management s discussion of income the consolidated statements of income included in item of this annual report summarize the operating performance of lafarge north america inc for the past three years 
to facilitate analysis  net sales and operating profit are discussed by operating segment and are summarized in the table below 
see segment and related information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further segment information 
our three operating segments are construction materials the production and distribution of construction aggregate  ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and asphalt  and the construction and paving of roads 
cement and cement related products the production and distribution of portland and specialty cements and slag  fly ash and associated blended products  and the processing of fuel quality waste and alternative raw materials for use in cement kilns 
gypsum the production and distribution of gypsum drywall and related products

sales volumes increased in all main product lines due to strong demand for our products and acquisitions 
additionally  aggregate and ready mixed concrete selling prices increased as well 
these increases were partly offset by lower average selling prices for gypsum drywall and cement 
despite the devaluation in the canadian dollar  canadian net sales improved million  or percent  to  million 
this increase was driven by recent acquisitions  most significantly the december merger with the warren paving materials group 
in addition  our heritage operations contributed to the canadian net sales increase as ready mixed concrete  aggregate and cement sales volumes increased by four percent  five percent and four percent  respectively 

table of contents construction materials net sales from construction materials operations reached a new high of  million  a percent increase from  reflecting improved sales volumes and average selling prices in both the us and canada 
overall ready mixed concrete shipments were million cubic yards in  seven percent higher than  and aggregate sales volumes were million tons  percent higher than asphalt and paving sales reached million  up percent from the warren paving materials group operations acquired in december and other recent acquisitions accounted for most of the improvement in shipments compared to last year 
in the us  net sales increased by million  or percent  to million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes increased by eight percent mainly due to strong demand and the acquisition  in february  of pine hill materials corp 
and american readi mix concrete corporation  partially offset by lower sales volumes in wisconsin where we sold our operations in the fourth quarter of average selling prices for ready mixed concrete in the us increased by four percent due to implemented price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
aggregate sales volumes in the us increased by percent due to the impact from recent acquisitions and a three percent increase in our heritage operations 
aggregate average selling prices increased by one percent compared to in canada  net sales increased by million  or percent  to  million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes in canada increased six percent from levels primarily due to increased demand brought on by the strength of the toronto economy and the absence of the effect of a ready mixed concrete drivers strike in toronto in ready mixed concrete average selling prices increased by three percent in local currency  however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  average selling prices declined one percent in us dollars 
the increase in average selling price resulted from general price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
canadian aggregate sales volumes were percent ahead of levels mainly due to the merger with the warren paving materials group at the end of excluding the impact of the warren operations  aggregate sales volumes increased six percent 
aggregate average selling prices increased six percent in local currency  however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  the effective increase in us dollars was reduced to two percent 
the average selling price was also favorably impacted by product and customer mix 
asphalt and paving sales increased percent to million  as heritage operations increased percent with the warren paving materials group accounting for the balance of the improvement 
cement and cement related products net sales from cement operations increased by two percent to  million from  million in due to increased sales volumes 
cement sales volumes totaled million tons  a two percent increase from  while the average selling price per ton in us dollars  net of freight costs net realization  declined slightly 
us net sales increased by million to million  as the benefit from mild weather in the fourth quarter led to a two percent increase in cement shipments 
net realization in the us declined one percent due to competitive pressures in certain markets and product and customer mix 
canadian cement net sales increased three percent to million from million in cement shipments in canada increased by four percent primarily due to the strong economy in ontario and favorable weather in the fourth quarter 
net realization rose by four percent in local currency  however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  the effective increase in us dollars was reduced to one percent 
the increase in net realization resulted from annual price increases and improved product and market mix 
also included in sales from our cement operations are sales of cement related products of million  a seven percent increase from  representing million tons of slag and fly ash 
gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in drywall sales volumes increased percent while average selling prices declined nearly percent compared to the volume increase reflects sales of million square feet of drywall from our new palatka  florida plant  which started production in january  as well as the ramp up of production at our silver grove  kentucky plant  where sales volumes increased million square feet over last year 
drywall prices continued 
table of contents the trend from and deteriorated through the first half of due to increased industry capacity 
we implemented three price increases in the second half of the year that have held fairly well  however  prices softened slightly late in the fourth quarter  following the normal seasonal pattern 
gross profit and cost of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent in  primarily reflecting a significant decline in gypsum results 
construction materials gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly to percent in from percent in due to a change in our product portfolio to more asphalt and paving  which has lower margins  arising from the december merger with the warren paving materials group 
cement gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to percent compared to percent in the average cash production cost per ton of cement in was equal to as lower fixed costs resulting from continued emphasis on performance improvement in our production facilities were offset by higher variable costs  primarily energy 
the cash production cost per ton increased slightly in the us due to purchased clinker at our sugar creek  missouri plant  but were offset by operating efficiencies at our canadian plants 
the following table summarizes our cement and clinker production in millions of tons and the clinker production capacity utilization rate years ended december cement production clinker production clinker capacity utilization cement production was essentially in line with  while clinker production declined two percent 
us cement production totaled million tons  down one percent  while canadian cement production increased four percent to million tons 
clinker capacity utilization at us plants declined to percent from percent due to slightly reduced production at several plants 
canadian clinker capacity utilization decreased slightly to percent from percent largely the result of decreased production at our exshaw  alberta plant where we extended the normal winter shutdown through the first quarter to help mitigate exorbitant gas prices 
gypsum operations reflect a negative gross profit as a percentage of net sales of percent  a decrease of percentage points from  due to the erosion of selling prices during  costs associated with the start up of a paper mill joint venture and the new production facility in palatka  florida  and increased energy costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increase resulted from growth in our construction materials operations and costs associated with the implementation of the shared service center for our construction materials group 
however  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent in  as efficiency programs helped to mitigate inflationary cost increases 
goodwill amortization amortization of goodwill was million in and million in the increase reflects amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger with the warren paving materials group 
in  we plan to fully adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized but rather be reviewed annually for impairment 

table of contents other income  net other income  net consists of a variety of items that management believes are non operating in nature 
key categories with amounts for and  respectively include gains on sale of fixed assets million and million  gains on divestitures of businesses million and million  loss on the sale of receivables under our securitization program million and million  losses on natural gas commodity contracts million and zero  losses or gains for other postretirement benefit expense for retirees and pension costs million loss and million gain  equity income million and million  expenses for restructuring million and zero  foreign exchange transaction gains or losses million loss and million gain  blue circle management fees million and zero and other miscellaneous gains or losses million loss and million net gain 
divestment gains in related primarily to the disposal of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and non strategic ready mixed concrete businesses in milwaukee  wisconsin 
the loss on the natural gas forward contracts resulted from recording a liability on the fair value of the commodity contracts in accordance with sfas no 
due to a decline in forward gas prices below the fixed contractual amounts 
restructuring costs in relate to the costs associated with reorganizing the cement business in the second half of performance by line of business construction materials operating profit from construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  million higher than this increase was driven by million of contribution from the warren operations  which were not part of lafarge in  positive contributions from other recent acquisitions and improvements in our heritage operations 
ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes and average selling prices both increased compared to these items were partially offset by a change in our product portfolio as the paving business  which operates at lower margins  represents a more significant portion of our total portfolio 
us operations earned million  million better than this increase was due to higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of eight percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete and aggregate of four percent and one percent  respectively 
these improvements were partially offset by increased rental expense and repair and maintenance costs 
despite a million reduction in earnings due to the impact of the weaker canadian dollar  the canadian operations earned million  million better than the increased earnings were due to higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of six percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices of three percent and six percent  respectively  in local currency 
however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  ready mixed concrete average selling prices declined one percent in us dollars and aggregate average selling prices increased only two percent in us dollars 
these items were partially offset by increased repair and maintenance costs 
cement and cement related products operating profit from cement operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  a million or one percent decline from the decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the canadian dollar and start up related costs for the new production line at our sugar creek  missouri plant 
during the second half of  we reorganized our cement operations into five geographic regions 
the new organization  designed to better serve our customers  was implemented effective january  in the us  operating profit totaled million  million or eight percent lower than the decrease resulted from a slight decline in net realization due to competitive pressures in certain markets and increased fuel and power costs  which were largely offset by a two percent increase in sales volumes 
there was also an increase in distribution costs arising from the spring flooding of the mississippi river  as well as start up costs for our new kiln line outside kansas city  missouri  which cost approximately million 
our canadian cement operations reported an operating profit of million  million higher than in  despite a million reduction in earnings due to the impact of the weaker canadian dollar 
the increased earnings were primarily due to increased sales volumes of four percent and net realization of four percent in local currency 
however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  the effective increase in us dollars was 
table of contents reduced to one percent 
these positives were partially offset by increased fuel and power costs 
operating profit from our cement related products slag and fly ash included in the cement results was million  a million increase from gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating loss of million  million higher than last year s operating loss of million 
the decrease in profitability was due to depressed drywall prices  increased energy costs  higher fixed costs associated with the start up of a paper mill joint venture and increased operating costs associated with the start up of the new palatka  florida drywall plant 
our silver grove and palatka drywall plants have both consistently improved their efficiency throughout the year and costs have progressively come down in both plants 
in the fourth quarter  the silver grove plant operated at a modest profit while the palatka plant was slightly below the breakeven level 
earnings before minority interests  interest and income taxes ebit in  ebit was million  a million or seven percent decline from this drop in profitability was affected by a million decline in our gypsum segment s results as well as approximately million of non recurring costs and a million impact from a decline in the value of the canadian dollar 
these were partially offset by the million gains on sale of assets  including the sale of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and certain non strategic ready mixed concrete businesses in wisconsin 
the non recurring costs consisted of million of natural gas derivative expense that is expected to reverse in and million of fixed costs related to the new sugar creek  missouri cement plant scheduled to start up in the first half of ebit in the us was million  million lower than ebit from canadian operations was million  million higher than despite a devaluation in the canadian dollar which had an impact of million 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in to million primarily due to higher debt levels in interest capitalized was million and million in and  respectively 
interest income interest income decreased million in  primarily from the absence this year of the favorable impact on last year s results of the million interest receivable from the canadian customs and revenue agency recorded from the settlement of transfer pricing and cost sharing issues for the to calendar years see income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the remaining decline relates primarily to a decrease in short term investments in canada see management s discussion of cash flows and a reduction in interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense decreased from million in to million in mostly from lower us pre tax income and the impact of lower federal and provincial tax rates in canada 
the income tax benefited from a one time adjustment of approximately canadian million approximately us million to reduce deferred tax balances to reflect the reduction in canadian tax rates 
we expect the multi year relief plan to positively impact earnings from canadian operations going forward 
excluding this one time adjustment  our effective income tax rate increased to percent for compared to percent in due to the impact of non tax deductible dividends paid to minority interests in net income we reported net income of million in compared with million in the major reason for the decline in profitability was the losses incurred in our gypsum operations  as well as non recurring 
table of contents charges consisting of a loss on natural gas derivatives and fixed costs related to the new sugar creek  missouri cement plant scheduled to start up in the first half of and a decline in the canadian dollar 
general outlook the company finished the year on a solid note as demand for our products remained strong throughout the fourth quarter  after recovering from a disappointing month of september 
however  the economic outlook in the us remains uncertain and we do not expect that there will be a clear sign of the trend of the construction business until the construction season begins in the spring 
the portland cement association has forecasted a percent reduction in us cement demand for if that forecast is accurate  it would negatively impact our business and profitability 
therefore  we are approaching the year with some caution 
we are focused on factors that we can control  such as performance improvement in our manufacturing and distribution operations  and we are taking those actions that we deem appropriate to provide the flexibility in our operations that will allow us to respond to unexpected changes  up or down  in the economic environment 
for our gypsum operations  we believe that price softness is likely to continue in the first quarter of when business is typically slower 
we have announced new price increases to be implemented in early march we will continue to seek to optimize our network of plants  and in particular to reduce costs in the older northeast facilities 
a positive factor for is our paperboard liner joint venture that is now producing paperboard liner  which we expect to benefit from in with lower cost materials 
also  in january we acquired continental gypsum  which is based in newark  new jersey 
this acquisition should strengthen our presence in the northeast market 
year ended december  net sales our net sales increased by two percent in to  million from  million in us net sales remained relatively unchanged from levels at  million as the result of several factors lower ready mixed concrete and cement sales volumes due to poor weather conditions in the fourth quarter and lower average selling prices for gypsum drywall 
these factors were mostly offset by aggregate sales volumes from the presque isle acquisition and increased ready mixed concrete and cement average selling prices due to implemented increases and changes in product mix 
canadian net sales were million  an increase of million or eight percent 
the increase was due to improving economic conditions in eastern canada  increased infrastructure spending and project work in british columbia and a strong oil and gas marketplace in northern alberta  which helped improve ready mixed concrete  aggregate and cement sales volumes and average selling prices 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations in the us and canada were  million  an increase of six percent from overall ready mixed concrete shipments to customers were million cubic yards in  two percent higher than  and aggregate sales volumes were million tons  percent higher than in the us  net sales increased by million  or two percent  to million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes decreased by one percent 
average selling prices for ready mixed concrete in the us regions increased by four percent due to implemented price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
aggregate sales volumes in the us increased by percent  of which six percent was due to growth in our existing operations with the remainder coming from volumes associated with the presque isle  michigan quarry acquired in june despite general price increases  average selling prices decreased by four percent when compared to the reduced selling price was due to increased sales of lower valued products and the impact of the presque isle quarry  which  because of its product mix  brought with it lower average prices than existing us operations 
in canada  net sales increased by million  or percent  to million  reflecting an increase in both sales volumes and 
table of contents average selling prices 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes in canada increased four percent from levels and average selling prices increased by three percent 
sales volumes increased over primarily due to increased project work 
the increase in average selling price resulted from general price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
canadian aggregate sales volumes were percent ahead of levels and average selling prices increased six percent 
volumes increased due to a strong market in ontario  and higher infrastructure spending  increased activity in the oil and gas sector and project work in western canada 
the average selling price increase was mainly due to a shift in the product mix to more premium products 
cement and cement related products net sales from cement operations increased by one percent to  million from  million in due to higher average selling prices 
cement sales volumes declined by million tons to million tons  which represents a one percent decline  while the average selling price per ton to customers  net of freight costs net realization  increased by percent 
us net sales decreased by million to million 
cement shipments through september were ahead of  but due to a percent decline in the fourth quarter brought on by heavy snowfall and extremely cold weather  annual cement shipments declined three percent 
net realization in the us increased only one percent due to competitive pressures in our markets 
canadian cement sales increased five percent to million from million in cement shipments in canada increased by four percent and net realization rose by two percent 
the improvement in volumes was primarily due to a strong northern alberta market  again in oil and gas infrastructure spending  increased oil well cement sales and expanded project work 
the increase in net realization resulted from improved product mix and annual price increases 
also included in sales of our cement operations are sales of cement related products of million  representing million tons of slag and fly ash 
this represents a nine percent increase in sales from gypsum despite a one percent increase in sales volumes  net sales from gypsum operations decreased by percent to million from million in average selling prices declined nearly percent compared to due to increased capacity in the industry and lower demand  with year end prices more than percent below those at year end the volume increase is due to million square feet of drywall sold from our new silver grove  kentucky plant  which started production in june this increase was mostly offset by reduced sales of imported drywall and a decline in sales of drywall from our newfoundland  canada plant 
a new drywall plant in northern florida began operating in early gross profit and cost of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent in  reflecting a significant decline in gypsum results and modest reductions in the cement operations 
construction materials gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained at percent in this was due to higher ready mixed concrete average selling prices in the us and canada and higher aggregate average selling prices in canada 
these factors were offset by higher material and fuel costs in all regions and increased operating costs in the western us and in eastern and western canada  as well as lower aggregate average selling prices in the us cement gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to percent compared to percent in the decline was the result of a four percent increase in cash production cost per ton partially offset by higher average selling prices 
in the us  cash production cost per ton increased slightly compared to in canada  cash production cost per ton increased by nine percent  primarily due to increased natural gas costs at the exshaw  alberta plant and increased maintenance and purchased clinker costs at the bath  ontario plant  partially offset by lower maintenance and fuel costs and other operating efficiencies associated with the new 
table of contents kiln at the richmond  british columbia plant 
the following table summarizes our cement and clinker production in millions of tons and the clinker production capacity utilization rate years ended december cement production clinker production clinker capacity utilization cement production was essentially in line with  while clinker production was one percent higher than us cement production totaled million tons  down two percent 
clinker capacity utilization at us plants declined to percent due to increases in capacity at several plants and slightly reduced production 
canadian cement production was million tons  up three percent 
canadian clinker capacity utilization decreased to percent from percent 
this decline was due to an increase in capacity  compared to prior year  at the richmond  british columbia plant 
gypsum s gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by percentage points to five percent  primarily due to erosion of selling prices during resulting from increased capacity in the industry  slowing demand  costs associated with the start up of two new production facilities  as well as increased raw material and energy costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increase was due to growth in our construction materials business  increased staffing particularly in the human resource and strategic development functions  the restructuring of the canadian gypsum operations  increased costs to support the billion square foot increase of gypsum drywall production capacity  costs associated with establishing a shared service center in our construction materials operations and the study and integration of several acquisitions throughout the year 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to percent from percent in goodwill amortization amortization of goodwill was million in both and we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in  we plan to fully adopt sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized but annually reviewed for impairment 
other income  net other income  net  consists of items such as equity income and gains and losses from divestitures 
other income  net  was million in compared with million in the million increase was primarily due to increased pension income of million  lower other postretirement benefit expense for retirees of million and higher gains on asset dispositions of million 
performance by line of business construction materials operating profit from construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  million higher than the improvement was due to higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes and higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete 
these items were partially offset by higher liquid asphalt  diesel and natural gas costs in most regions 
the significant increase in the cost of natural gas  diesel and liquid asphalt  as well as the costs associated with implementing a number of 
table of contents management training programs and establishing a shared service center for accounting and transaction processing  impacted year operating profit by approximately million 
us operations earned million  million better than this increase was due to higher aggregate sales volumes of percent  higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete of four percent and lower depreciation expense  partially offset by reduced ready mixed concrete sales volumes of one percent  and increased material  delivery and overhead costs 
earnings in the eastern us were favorably impacted by the acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june and the divestment of the unprofitable maryland asphalt and paving operations in in the western us  earnings were below prior year due to increased aggregate operating costs  primarily in central missouri  reduced ready mixed concrete sales volumes from poor weather conditions in the fourth quarter in the majority of our major markets and lower average selling prices for aggregate 
the canadian operations earned million  million better than  primarily reflecting higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of four percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices of three percent and six percent  respectively  partially offset by increased material  delivery and overhead costs 
cement and cement related products operating profit from cement operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  a million or one percent decline from the decline was due to lower cement sales volumes and higher energy and operating costs  partially offset by increased net realization due to general price increases 
for the full year  energy cost increases for process fuel and delivery totaled approximately million 
the most significant impact was at our exshaw  alberta plant 
in the us  where we burn primarily coal and petroleum coke  the process fuel cost increase was limited 
however  freight costs  particularly in the second half of the year  were affected more significantly 
in the us  operating profit was million  million two percent lower than the decline resulted from lower cement sales volumes of three percent due largely to poor weather in the fourth quarter and increased transportation costs 
our canadian cement operations reported an operating profit of million  million higher than in  primarily due to increased sales volumes of four percent and net realization of two percent  which was largely offset by rising fuel costs and increased maintenance and purchased clinker at the bath  ontario plant 
operating profit from our cement related products slag and fly ash included in the cement results was million  an increase of million from gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating loss of million  a million decline from s operating profit of million 
the swing in profitability was due to declining drywall prices  rising raw material costs  increased energy costs  costs associated with the start up of the new silver grove  kentucky plant in  preparations to start up the new palatka  florida plant in  and additional administrative and marketing costs required to support a billion square foot increase in production capacity 
average selling prices declined nearly percent compared to with year end prices off more than percent from a year ago 
earnings before minority interests  interest and income taxes ebit in  ebit was million  a million percent decline from this drop in profitability was due to the million swing in our gypsum segment s results 
through the first three quarters of  improvements in our construction materials and cement segments largely offset the reduction in gypsum profitability 
however  heavy snowfall and extremely cold weather in the last quarter reversed these earlier gains 
ebit in the us was million  million lower than ebit from canadian operations was million  million higher than interest expense interest expense decreased by million in to million primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest 
interest capitalized was million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents interest income interest income increased million in this increase is composed of million of interest receivable from the canadian customs and revenue agency recorded as the result of the settlement of transfer pricing and cost sharing issues for the to calendar years see income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
this was partially offset by lower average canadian short term investment balances during income taxes income tax expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to lower profits in in the us and a reduction in our effective income tax rate to percent in from percent in net income we reported net income of million in compared with million in the major reason for the decline in profitability was the losses incurred in our gypsum operations  as well as higher energy costs and higher selling and administrative expenses 
other factors affecting the company critical accounting policies certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reflected at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill goodwill is amortized using the straight line method over periods not exceeding years 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  derived from such goodwill over its remaining life 
similar to our review for impairment of other long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that it is probable that a liability for environmental matters has been incurred  an undiscounted estimate of the required remediation costs is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements  without offset of potential insurance recoveries 
costs that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from the sale of cement  concrete  concrete products  aggregate and gypsum drywall is recorded when the products are shipped 
revenue from waste recovery and disposal is recognized when the material is received  tested and accepted 
revenue from road construction contracts is recognized on the basis of units of work completed  while revenue from other indivisible lump sum contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling are included in net sales  and costs incurred by the seller for shipping and handling are classified as cost of goods sold 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use commodity based derivatives to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we periodically enter into natural gas forward purchase agreements for a portion of our anticipated gas purchases to hedge price risk associated with fluctuations in market prices 
to the extent possible  we elect to apply the normal purchases or sales exception in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas normal purchases and normal sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of something other than a financial instrument or derivative instrument that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by us over a reasonable period in the normal course of business 
often this exception to the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  will apply to purchases of commodities used on our production process that would otherwise be considered derivative instruments 
when applied  this exception allows us to not recognize these derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value as required by sfas no 
when the normal purchases or sales exception is not applied  the derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we may execute derivatives for purposes of hedging various commodity price and financial exposures 
for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting  on the date the derivative contract is entered into we designate the derivative and document the hedge relationship as either a fair value or cash flow hedge in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge relationship s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
the company will only apply hedge accounting to those relationships that have been properly designated and documented and are anticipated to be highly effective 
classification of a change in a derivative s fair value is determined by whether the derivative is designated in a qualifying hedge relationship 
for a derivative in a qualifying cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s fair value change is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
for a derivative in a qualifying fair value hedge  effective changes in the fair value are reported in the consolidated statements of income  along with changes in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged

environmental matters our operations  like those of our competitors  are subject to state  federal  local and canadian environmental laws and regulations  which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts  and require pollution control and prevention  site restoration and operating permits and or approvals to conduct certain of our operations 
federal environmental laws that impose liability for remediation include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  which together are referred to as superfund  and the corrective action provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra 
under superfund s current broad liability provisions  the 
table of contents us environmental protection agency epa may commence a civil action against potentially responsible parties prps or order prps to remediate sites containing hazardous substances and pollution associated with past or ongoing practices 
under superfund  strict liability for cleanup costs can be imposed even if a prp was not directly responsible for site conditions 
in addition  the liability is joint and several  which means that the epa can seek the entire cost of cleaning up a site from one prp  even if other prps were responsible for a substantial portion of the contamination 
some of the environmental laws intended to control or prevent pollution include the pollution control provisions of rcra controlling solid and hazardous wastes  the clean water act controlling discharge of pollutants into the waters of the us and the clean air act controlling emission of pollutants into the atmosphere 
to prevent  control and remediate environmental problems and maintain compliance with permitting requirements  we maintain an environmental program designed to monitor and control environmental matters 
this program is based upon our environmental policy and includes recruitment  training and retention of personnel experienced in environmental matters 
company employees are responsible for identifying potential environmental issues and bringing them to the attention of management who are responsible for addressing environmental matters 
in this regard  we require operational management to immediately report to corporate management any spills or material instances of non compliance 
further  routine environmental matters are required to be reported quarterly 
if necessary  we engage outside consultants to determine an appropriate course of action and estimate the likely financial exposure presented by the environmental matter 
we routinely audit our properties to determine whether remediation is required  the adequacy of accruals for such remediation  the status of remedial activities and whether improvements to the site are required to meet current and future permit or other requirements under the environmental laws 
our program also includes an environmental recognition award program  an environmental report and implementation of lafarge group s voluntary environmental partnership with the world wildlife fund focusing on biodiversity  indicators to measure continuing environmental improvement and a co reduction commitment 
currently  we are involved in one superfund remediation 
at this site  which the epa has listed on the national priority list  some of the potentially responsible parties named by the epa have initiated a third party action against parties  including us 
we also have been named a potentially responsible party for this site 
the suit alleges that in one of our predecessor companies sold equipment containing hazardous substances that may now be present at the site 
it appears that the largest disposer of hazardous substances at this new site is the us department of defense 
we understand that the department of defense has accepted a substantial share of responsibility for the site s remediation and is pursuing a remediation plan with the epa 
the suit has otherwise been dormant for several years 
we believe that this matter will not have a material impact on our financial condition 
we record environmental accruals when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
environmental remediation accruals are based on internal studies and estimates  including shared financial liability with third parties 
accruals are adjusted when further information or additional studies warrant 
environmental accruals are undiscounted estimates of required remediation costs without offset of potential insurance or other claims 
when such recoveries become probable  those amounts are reflected as receivables in the financial statements  and are not netted against the accruals 
recorded environmental liabilities are not material to us 
while we believe the possibility of incurring material environmental liability in excess of recorded amounts is remote  we may incur environmental costs in excess of amounts recorded at december  environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
for the years ended december   and  our environmental capital expenditures and remediation expenses were not material 
however  our environmental expenditures have increased and are likely to increase in the future 
currently  proposed changes or new environmental laws or regulations include promulgation of revised epa boiler and industrial furnaces regulations under rcra and the maximum achievable control technology provision of the clean air act  promulgation of new cement kiln dust management standards under rcra and or implementation under state solid waste laws and regulations  promulgation of final clean air act maximum achievable control 
table of contents technology regulations governing air toxic emissions from non waste burning cement plants  state revisions of clean air act state implementation plans to require nox reductions for cement plants operating in certain areas east of the mississippi  state revisions of clean air act state implementation plans to require reduction of particulate matter particles microns or less from our various operations  federal permit requirements under title v of the clean air act  and implementing the kyoto protocol  primarily in canada  which may require us to reduce co emissions and or carbon concentrations in our final product 
we cannot presently determine the exact timing of their impact  whether these proposed changes will require capital expenditures or other remedial actions  or the effect of such changes on our financial statements 
because of different requirements in the environmental laws of the us and canada  the complexity and uncertainty of existing and future requirements of environmental laws  permit conditions  costs of new and existing technology  potential preventive and remedial costs  insurance coverages  and enforcement related activities and costs  we cannot determine at this time whether capital expenditures and other remedial actions that we may be required to undertake in the future will materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
with respect to known environmental contingencies  we have recorded provisions for estimated probable liabilities and do not believe that the ultimate resolution of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
management s discussion of cash flows the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our main sources and uses of cash 
these statements show the relationship between the operations presented in the consolidated statements of income and liquidity and financial resources depicted in the consolidated balance sheets 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of our capital expenditures  working capital needs  debt service obligations and dividends 
we usually meet our operating liquidity needs through internal generation of cash except in the event of significant acquisitions 
short term borrowings are generally used to fund seasonal operating requirements  particularly in the first two calendar quarters 
cash flows from operations the net cash provided by operations for each of the three years presented reflects our net income adjusted for non cash items 
the changes in working capital are discussed in management s discussion of financial position 
depreciation  depletion and amortization in increased million due to increases from capital expenditures and acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization in remained at levels as increases from capital expenditures and acquisitions were offset by lower depreciation expense in our construction materials business 
gains on sale of assets increased million in due to the disposal of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and non strategic ready mixed concrete businesses in milwaukee  wisconsin 
cash flows from investing capital expenditures decreased million in largely because ongoing development projects  such as the construction of the silver grove  kentucky and palatka  florida gypsum drywall plants  were completed in or early capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million to million in we intend to invest in projects that maintain or improve the performance of our plants as well as in acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our competitive position in the us and canada 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on slag production and grinding operations in chicago  million on the sugar creek  missouri cement plant  million on a deep water import terminal in louisiana and million on the optimization of our joppa  illinois cement plant 
spending on acquisitions decreased million from the relatively high level in due to the merger with the warren paving materials group in late december and the acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june redemptions of short term investments  net  decreased million from due to selling short term investments in the prior year to finance the merger with the warren paving materials group 
proceeds from 
table of contents the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items totaled million in compared to million in due mainly to the disposal of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and milwaukee ready mixed concrete businesses 
capital expenditures increased in from due largely to ongoing development projects such as the construction of the silver grove  kentucky and palatka  florida gypsum drywall plants and the sugar creek  missouri cement plant expansion 
spending for acquisitions in increased from due to the merger with the warren paving materials group late in december and the acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items  including the disposition late in of asphalt and paving operations in maryland  totaled million for and million for cash flows from financing in  net cash consumed by financing was million compared to net cash provided from financing of million in this change resulted from a decrease in short term borrowings  partially offset by a decrease in the repurchase of common stock see common equity interests in the notes to consolidated financial statements concerning the buyback program of common stock 
we have access to a wide variety of short term and long term financing alternatives in both the us and canada and have a syndicated  committed  five year revolving credit facility with nine participants totaling million 
at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under these credit facilities 
during  we entered into a receivables securitization program to provide a cost effective source of working capital and short term financing 
under the program  we agreed to transfer  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to unrelated third party purchasers up to a maximum of million 
under the agreements  new receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold receivables 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold  which as of december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
since this program is accounted for as a sale of receivables  the related cash flows are included in net cash provided by operations 
management s discussion of financial position the consolidated balance sheets summarize our financial position at december  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our canadian revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  as well as interest rate risk inherent in our debt 
as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we primarily use fixed rate debt instruments to reduce the risk of exposure to changes in interest rates and have used forward treasury lock agreements in the past to hedge interest rate changes on anticipated debt issuances 
the value reported for canadian dollar denominated net assets decreased from december  as a result of a decline in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
at december   the us dollar equivalent of a canadian dollar was versus at december  based on results  if the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar changed by percent  our consolidated net assets would change by approximately four percent and net income would change by approximately six percent 
liquidity is not materially impacted  however  since canadian earnings are considered to be permanently invested in canada 
working capital  excluding cash  short term investments  current portion of long term debt and the impact of exchange rate changes million  increased million from december  to december  accounts receivable  excluding an exchange rate impact of million  increased million primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter  recent acquisitions and a decrease in receivables sold under our securitization program 
inventories decreased million  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  due to increased levels of sales in the fourth quarter 
the increase of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  resulted mainly from our growth and an increase in amounts payable under our receivable sales agreement to settle a 
table of contents year end decrease in securitized receivables 
income taxes payable increased million  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  due to increased levels of fourth quarter income and the timing of installment payments 
net property  plant and equipment increased million during  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  primarily due to acquisitions and the expansion of the sugar creek  missouri cement plant and the construction of slag production and grinding operations in chicago 
capital expenditures and acquisitions of fixed assets totaled million in goodwill relates primarily to the redland  warren and presque isle transactions 
our capitalization is summarized in the following table december long term debt other long term liabilities and minority interests shareholders equity total capitalization the increase in shareholders equity as a percentage of total capitalization is discussed in management s discussion of shareholders equity 
management s discussion of shareholders equity the consolidated statements of shareholders equity summarize the activity in each component of shareholders equity for the three years presented 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million and the exercise of stock options for million 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a six percent decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  share repurchases of million and the recognition of a million minimum pension liability  net of income taxes 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million and the issuance of a common stock warrant for million 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a four percent decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and share repurchases of million 
common equity interests include our par value per share common stock and the lafarge canada inc exchangeable preference shares  which are exchangeable into our common stock and have comparable voting  dividend and liquidation rights 
our common stock is traded on the new york and toronto stock exchanges under the ticker symbol laf and the exchangeable preference shares on the toronto stock exchange under the ticker symbol lcipre the following table reflects the range of high and low closing prices of common stock by quarter for and as quoted on the new york stock exchange quarters ended mar jun sep dec stock prices high low stock prices high low 
table of contents dividends are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december common equity dividends less dividend reinvestments net cash dividend payments common equity dividends per share there have been no changes in the dividend rate since october management s discussion of selected consolidated financial data the selected consolidated financial data highlights certain significant trends in our financial condition and results of operations 
net sales in increased by percent primarily due to the addition of the redland operations as well as increased shipments and prices 
in  net sales increased by eight percent primarily due to favorable economic conditions supporting demand in most segments and increased average selling prices 
in  net sales increased by two percent due to acquisitions throughout our operations and improving economic conditions 
in  net sales increased by percent mainly due to recent acquisitions  increased volumes from our heritage operations as well as increased average selling prices for ready mixed concrete and aggregate and canadian cement 
these were partially offset by reduced average selling prices for cement in the us and gypsum drywall 
see management s discussion of income for additional details 
inflation rates in recent years have not been a significant factor in our net sales or earnings growth 
we continually attempt to offset the effect of inflation by improving operating efficiencies  especially in the areas of selling and administrative expenses  productivity and energy costs 
we compete with other suppliers of our products in all of our markets 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 
net cash provided by operations consists of net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and changes in operating working capital 
we are in a capital intensive industry and  as a result  we recognize large amounts of depreciation 
we have used our cash provided by operations to expand our markets  improve the performance of our plants and other operating equipment  and for the years prior to the redland acquisition  to reduce debt 
capital expenditures and acquisitions  excluding the redland assets that were acquired for million in but were accounted for similar to a pooling of interests  totaled  million over the past five years  which included the construction of new drywall plants in kentucky and florida  acquisition of a cement plant and related limestone quarry  cement plant projects to increase production capacity and reduce costs including the new richmond  british columbia cement plant and the sugar creek  missouri cement plant  the installation of receiving and handling facilities for substitute fuels and raw materials  the building and purchasing of additional distribution terminals and water transportation facilities to extend markets and improve existing supply networks  the expansion of our cement related products operations  the expansion of asphalt  paving and aggregate operations through the merger with the warren paving materials group  the acquisition of ready mixed concrete plants and aggregate operations  including our acquisition of the presque isle quarry  rocky mountain materials  pine hill materials corp  american readi mix concrete corporation and several other small tuck in acquisitions  and the renewal of the construction materials mobile equipment fleet 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency risks 
we have defined strict policies and procedures to measure  manage and monitor our market risk exposures 
our policies do not permit any speculative market position 
we have instituted management rules based on a segregation of operations  financial and administrative control  and risk measurement 
we use financial instruments only to hedge existing or anticipated financial and commercial exposures 
we undertake this hedging in the over the counter market with a limited number of highly rated counterparts 
our positions in derivative financial instruments are monitored using various techniques  including the fair value approach 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity risk with respect to price changes principally in the coal  coke  natural gas  electricity and diesel fuel 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into long term contracts and increasing our use of alternative fuels 
we occasionally use commodity based derivatives to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we execute these commodity based derivatives for the purpose of hedging the economic exposure to commodity price changes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices  we expose ourself to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes us  which creates credit risk for us 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counterparty and  therefore  it does not possess credit risk 
we minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high quality counterparties 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices 
this market risk is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
as such  a percent change in the commodity prices for hedged items would cause a change on the december  consolidated net assets and the consolidated net income by less than million  net of any other impact 
foreign currency risk translation risks the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of our canadian operating entities are denominated in a foreign currency 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars 
thus  assets  liabilities  income and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollars must be translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate to be included in our financial statements 
if the us dollar increases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in the canadian dollar will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in canadian dollars will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar has a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our canadian dollar denominated assets  liabilities  income and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
at december  and for the year then ended  approximately percent of our consolidated net assets and percent of consolidated net income was attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in canadian dollars 
as such  a percent change in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate would cause a change on consolidated net assets and consolidated net income by approximately million and million  net of any other impact  respectively 

table of contents transaction risks we are subject to limited foreign currency exchange risks as a consequence of commercial exposures as a result of purchase and sale transactions in currencies other than our operating currencies 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange risks related to transactions is insignificant 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk exposure through our debt 
in the past we have entered into interest rate forward agreements to reduce our exposure to market risks from changing interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances 
these contracts were terminated in when the hedged forecasted debt was issued  and any resulting hedging gains and losses from these contracts are reported as a component of the carrying amount of the hedged debt and are being recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining debt terms 
at december   we had no derivative instruments related to interest rates 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both our outstanding or forecasted debt obligations 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
our interest rate exposure can be subdivided into the following risks price risk for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities by contracting a fixed rate liability  for example  we are exposed to an opportunity cost in the event of a fall in interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the market value of fixed rate assets and liabilities  leaving the associated financial income or expense unchanged 
at december   percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at fixed rates 
for a further discussion of our financial policy and interest rate exposure  see the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements reported in item of part ii of the annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
cash flow risk for floating rate assets and liabilities changes in interest rates have little impact on the market value of floating rate assets and liabilities  but directly influence our future income or expense flows 
we use variable rate debt to finance our operations 
at december   approximately percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at variable rates  which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
as such  a one percent change in the average interest rate would cause a change on consolidated net income of approximately million  net of any other impact
