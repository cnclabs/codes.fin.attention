item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of edison should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report 
information presented herein has been restated for fiscal and to reflect the adjustments more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors that include  but are not limited to  those set forth under additional risk factors that may affect future results 
overview we are the nation s largest private operator of public schools serving students from kindergarten through th grade 
we contract with local school districts and public charter school boards to assume educational and operational responsibility for individual schools in return for per pupil funding that is generally comparable to that spent on other public schools in the area 
we opened our first four schools in august and have grown rapidly in every subsequent year 
we served approximately  students in schools located in states across the country and the district of columbia in the school year 
additionally  we served approximately  students in our summer school program during the summer of for the school year  we expect enrollment of approximately  students in schools located in states and the district of columbia 
our net revenue in fiscal was million 
from our formation in until opening our first schools in fiscal  we were a development stage company focused on research  development and marketing of the edison school design and curriculum and raising capital to support our business plan 
from until  edison s team of leading educators and scholars developed an innovative  research backed curriculum and school design 
we operated as a partnership prior to november  when we converted to a corporation 
as of june   our accumulated deficit since november was approximately million 
in addition  prior to november  we incurred losses of approximately million  which are reflected in our additional paid in capital 
edison s curriculum expenses include the ongoing costs to maintain and support edison s educational design 
these expenses include the salaries and wages of trained educators in our central office curriculum department  the costs of providing professional training to our staff and teachers  including materials  and the ongoing costs of maintaining and updating the teaching methods and educational content of our program 
we make a significant investment in each school we open 
the investment generally includes initial staff training and professional development  technology  including laptop computers for teachers  books and other materials to support the edison curriculum and school design  and upgrades in facilities 
gross student funding gross student funding represents the gross contractual funding for our schools before all expenses 
the difference between gross student funding and net revenues consists of costs that edison is not primarily obligated to pay 
gross student funding is not equivalent to revenue as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
net revenue revenues are principally earned from contractual agreements to manage and operate contract and charter schools 
the company also earns revenue from summer school and after school program fees 
the company recognizes revenue for each managed school pro rata over the eleven months from august through june  typically the period over which we perform our services  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
most of our management agreements provide that we earn a fee based upon the number of children that attend our schools and  therefore  we only earn revenue to the extent students attend our schools 
in most instances  there is a base fee per pupil and several categorical fee components paid only for students in certain categories eg  low income  english as a second language  etc in some of our charter schools  our fee has a fixed component and variable component 
even in contracts where we have a fixed fee component  we have generally agreed to forego or reduce our fee if there is a budget shortfall at the charter school 
the company is generally responsible to its clients for all aspects of the management of its schools including but not limited to the academic achievement of the students  selection  training and compensation of school personnel  procurement of curriculum and equipment necessary for operations of the school  and the safe operation of the school facilities 
gross student funding represents gross contractual funding for our schools before all costs 
net revenue represents gross student funding less costs that we are not primarily obligated to pay 
the company follows the guidance of eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred regarding classification of revenues 
specifically  the company recognizes revenues net of expenses that the company is not primarily obligated to pay 
the company recognizes per pupil funding from local  state and federal sources  including title i and special education funding 
significant management estimates and assumptions are required to determine these funding levels  particularly in interim periods 
on a quarterly basis  the company records adjustments to revenue  if necessary  for enrollment fluctuations  changes to per pupil funding estimates  and changes to estimates for federal and state categorical grant funding 
anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf clarifies eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which provides guidance on whether revenues should be presented gross or net of certain costs 
after consultation with its independent auditors  the company believes that eitf should be interpreted to require it to present as revenue and expense only those direct site expenses that the company is primarily obligated to pay 
in accordance with the transition provisions of eitf  the company adopted eitf effective january  and has reclassified all historical periods to conform with the new presentation and  in the interest of transparency  added a gross student funding line to its statements of operations 
gross student funding is not equivalent to revenue as defined by gaap 
in november  the eitf issued eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
eitf addresses the appropriate income statement characterization of consideration given by a vendor to a customer  specifically whether that consideration should be presented in the vendor s income statements as a reduction of revenue or as an expense 
in consultation with its independent auditors the company determined that consideration given to two customers was  in effect  an adjustment of the company s contract price and should be accounted for as a reduction in revenue rather than as an expense subsequent to the promulgation of eitf in accordance with the transition provisions of eitf  the company adopted eitf effective january  and has reclassified all historical periods to conform with the new presentation 
direct site expenses direct site expenses include most of the expenses incurred on site at our schools 
the largest component of this expense is salaries and wages  primarily for principals and teachers  which are often paid for by our clients on our behalf  in which case they are disclosed as direct site expense client paid 
the remaining direct site expenses include on site administration  facility maintenance  utilities and  in some cases  student transportation 
once staffing levels for the school year are determined  most of these expenses are fixed  and accordingly  variations in enrollment will generally not change the overall cost structure of a school for that year 
direct site expenses do not include teacher training and other pre opening expenses associated with new schools  financing costs or depreciation and amortization related to technology  including computers for teachers and students  curriculum materials and capital improvements to school buildings 
gross site contribution and gross site margin we define gross site contribution as net revenue less direct site expenses 
gross site margin is gross site contribution expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
prior to our adoption of eitf  eitf and eitf  we calculated gross site margin as gross site contribution expressed as a percentage of what is now defined as gross student funding 
although gross site contribution is the same dollar amount in each calculation  under the new treatment the gross site margin percentage is higher as a result of using net revenues 
gross site contribution is a measurement of ongoing site level operating performance of our schools 
we believe it serves as a useful operating measurement when evaluating our schools financial performance 
gross site margins vary considerably from school to school and sometimes year to year for the same school 
gross site contribution does not reflect all site related costs  including depreciation and amortization or interest expense and principal repayment related to site level investments  or on site pre opening expenses  and accordingly gross site contribution does not represent site level profitability 
administration  curriculum and development expenses support from our central office is important for the successful delivery of our curriculum and school design 
administration  curriculum and development expenses include those amounts related to the creation and enhancement of our curriculum  and our general  administrative and sales and marketing functions 
these costs include costs for curriculum  assessment and training professionals  sales and marketing personnel  financial reporting  legal  technological support  travel expenses and other development activities 
pre opening expenses pre opening expenses consist principally of various administrative and personnel costs incurred prior to the opening of a new school or the expansion of an existing school  particularly the costs for the initial training and orientation of professional staff  recruitment and travel expenses and expenses for temporary offices and staff 
in connection with the establishment of a new school  we seek to hire the school s principal several months in advance of the school s opening 
this allows the principal to hire staff  most of whom receive substantial professional training in the edison education design prior to the first day of school 
pre opening expenses generally are first incurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year prior to the school s opening or expansion and generally continue into the first or second quarter of the fiscal year in which the school opens 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization relates primarily to the investments we make in each school for books and other educational materials  including enrollment fees for the success for all program  computers and other technology  and facility improvements 
these investments support the edison curriculum and school design and relate directly to our provision of educational services 
the depreciation and amortization of investments in our central office is also included 
enrollment our annual budgeting process establishes site specific revenue and expense objectives  which include assumptions about enrollment and anticipated per student funding 
while our budgets include desired enrollment levels  we do not attempt to maximize enrollment based upon the physical capacity of our facilities 
our budgets are designed to achieve both financial and academic goals  both of which we believe are critical to the success of our business 
therefore  our budgets are designed to achieve the proper balance between financial performance and academic standards 
we implement various strategies to achieve optimal enrollment  including local recruiting  media advertising  and coordinating with our school district partners and community groups 
since some site costs are partially fixed  incremental enrollment can positively affect profitability 
further  due to the closely correlated relationship of site revenue and expenses  school personnel closely manage expenses based upon actual enrollment 
over the last three years our schools have operated at or higher of the enrollment levels assumed in our budget 
as discussed below under financial performance  we do not believe that achieving of assumed enrollment at each school is necessary to achieve positive cash flow 
reengineering on august   the company announced several initiatives emerging from a company wide reengineering effort 
the initiatives are intended to redesign edison s infrastructure to improve service delivery to its schools  increase student achievement and customer satisfaction  and accelerate edison s path to profitability 
among other changes  the company announced significant improvements in its headquarters operations including an enhanced customer service function  strengthening of its financial reporting and facilities financing unit  a ramp up of its communications function  a more efficient organization of its general financial function  and an alignment of its internal functions with a consolidated and streamlined regional structure 
the company anticipates million of charges associated with one time costs related to the reengineering 
financial performance we have incurred substantial net losses in every fiscal period since we began operations 
for the fiscal year ended june   our net loss was million 
as of june   our accumulated deficit since november  when we converted from a partnership to a corporation  was approximately million 
in addition  prior to november  we incurred losses of approximately million  which are reflected in our additional paid in capital 
the following table sets forth various financial data expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  net revenue education and operating expenses direct site expenses company paid client paid administration  curriculum and development expenses impairment charges depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses total education and operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss from operations before provision for taxes provision for state and local taxes net loss in order to achieve profitability  we believe it will be necessary to improve gross site margin while maintaining educational quality and continuing to reduce central expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
the latter improvement is largely dependent on our ability to increase our net revenue through expanded student enrollment while controlling central costs 
in general  we believe that reaching positive cash flow  like achieving profitability  will be dependent on increasing our aggregate gross site contribution without a proportionate increase in central expenses 
because gross site contribution is the difference between site revenues and site expenditures  positive gross site contribution can be achieved at a range of enrollment levels 
while higher enrollment tends to have a positive effect on gross site contribution  our financial success does not depend on enrollment at each site 
management agreements renewals and terminations our management agreements generally have a term of five years 
when we expand by adding an additional school under an existing management agreement  the term with respect to that school generally expires at the end of the initial five year period 
we cannot be assured that a management agreement will be renewed at the end of its term 
two management agreements covering five schools expired at the end of the school year and were not renewed 
additionally  two management agreements representing three schools expired at the end of the school year and have not been renewed  although we are continuing to manage those schools while discussing renewal of those agreements 
with respect to one of these agreements  covering one school  the state has directed the school to bid out the renewal of the agreement to multiple companies 
in addition  termination of a management agreement may occur prior to its expiration date for a variety of reasons 
six management agreements covering of the schools we are operating for the school year and accounting for of our total revenue for the year are terminable by the school district or charter board at will  with or without good reason 
moreover  all of our management agreements may be terminated for cause  including in some cases a failure to meet specified educational standards  such as academic performance based on standardized test scores 
in addition  as a result of payment disputes or changes within a school district  such as changes in the political climate  from time to time we face pressure to permit a school district or charter board to terminate our management agreement even if they do not have a legal right to do so 
we may also seek the early termination of  or not seek to renew  a limited number of management agreements in any year 
six management agreements covering schools  three due to expire at the end of the school year  one at the end of the school year  one at the end of the school year  and one at the end of the school year were terminated at the end of the school year 
in addition  under a management agreement expiring at the end of the school year  the number of schools managed was reduced from four to two during the school year 
it is likely that each year some management agreements will expire unrenewed or be terminated prior to expiration 
management agreements representing schools  accounting for of our total revenue for fiscal  will expire at the end of the school year  and agreements representing schools  accounting for of our total revenue for fiscal  will expire at the end of the school year 
with regard to one of these agreements covering two schools  we have been informed that the board will not renew the agreement when it expires in june additionally  we have received formal notice that a management agreement covering seven schools and due to expire at the end of the school year will be terminated at the end of the school year 
see additional risk factors that may affect future results our management agreements with school districts and charter boards are terminable under specified circumstances and generally expire after a term of five years 
contract schools compared to charter schools we operate two types of schools contract and charter 
contract schools are public schools we operate under a management agreement with local school boards 
charter schools are schools we operate under a management agreement with a charter holder  which is typically a community group or non profit entity that has been granted a state authorized charter to create a public school 
the cost of operating a contract school and a charter school is similar  except that  in the case of a charter school  we are typically required to arrange for a facility 
in some cases  we operate charter schools under a charter granted by the local school board  which provides the facility 
in these cases  we categorize these schools as contract schools because we do not provide the facilities and therefore the economics of these arrangements closely resemble those of a contract school 
charter school facilities that are not provided by a local school board are financed in a variety of ways  including bank debt  municipal bonds  sale leaseback arrangements  third party ownership by real estate investment trusts and philanthropy 
at times  we advance funds or guarantee loans to our charter board clients to assist them in arranging for facilities 
as of june   we had approximately million in loans and advances outstanding net of allowances and guaranteed loans of million to our charter board clients 
our facility investment for a charter school will generally exceed our investment in facilities for a contract school 
because of these higher costs  we generally seek to establish charter schools in areas with higher per pupil revenue 
stock based and other non cash compensation expenses beginning in  we granted a number of stock options with four and five year terms 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to extend the term of these options to ten years and to make other changes in their terms that we believe are customary for options granted by public companies 
as a result  we were required to record compensation expense at that time representing the difference between the exercise price of the options and the deemed fair market value of the shares underlying the stock options 
in this regard  we recognized an expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this is in addition to million of stock based compensation expenses recorded in fiscal in connection with stock options that were subject to variable accounting treatment 
we have recognized  and expect to continue to recognize  expenses related to the option amendments over the vesting periods of the individual stock options 
these additional expenses were approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal  and are expected to be  for fiscal and  for fiscal to the extent we discretionarily accelerate stock options or otherwise modify the terms of stock options in the future  we could incur additional non cash charges 
we may also  from time to time  grant options below fair market value which could result in further charges at the time of grant 
in november  our ceo exercised options to purchase  shares of common stock at per share through the issuance of a promissory note for  in addition  we loaned  in november and  in april to our ceo to pay estimated income taxes resulting from the transaction 
these notes mature five years from their date of issuance 
in the past  we have accounted for the transaction as an option exercise and carried the loans as notes receivable on our balance sheets and recognized periodic interest income 
the notes were issued with recourse solely to the shares exercised and contain a floating rate of interest 
therefore  we have determined that it is more appropriate to treat the options as not having been exercised and account for them as a variable stock award pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force issue  accounting for stock compensation arrangements with employer loan features under apb opinion accordingly  the company has restated its fiscal and financial statements to reflect compensation in the form of a charge or credit to operations and an offsetting adjustment to additional paid in capital for periodic changes in the market value of the  common shares subject to exercise  until such notes are paid 
in addition  the loans related to estimated income taxes have been restated to be expensed when originally issued 
interest income previously recognized under the notes has been reversed 
interest received under the notes will be credited to additional paid in capital 
in connection with the restatement  the company recognized  in fiscal  a compensation charge of approximately million and a reduction in interest income of  in fiscal  the market value of the company s common stock decreased from per share at the beginning of year to per share at june  as a result  the company recognized a compensation credit of  and a reduction in interest income previously provided of  in fiscal  the market price of the company s common stock declined from per share at the beginning of the year to a value below the exercise price of per share by year end 
accordingly  the remaining amount of compensation expense recognized in prior years  including a portion related to fiscal  of  was reversed and no interest income was recognized for the year

mr 
feild served as the company s chief financial officer and executive vice president until july  income taxes we have not recorded any provision for federal income taxes because we have incurred net losses from our inception through june  as of june   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
approximately million are expected to expire between fiscal and  and approximately million are expected to expire between fiscal and given our limited operating history  losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we do not believe the realization of the related deferred income tax assets meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  we have recorded a full valuation allowance 
for fiscal  we have recorded a provision for taxes that reflects state and local income taxes arising from our operations of several sites 
seasonality because new schools are opened in the first fiscal quarter of each year  trends in our business  whether favorable or unfavorable  will tend not to be reflected in our quarterly financial results  but will be evident primarily in year to year comparisons 
the first quarter of our fiscal year has historically reflected less revenue and lower expenses than the other three quarters  and we expect this pattern to continue 
we generally have lower gross site margin in the first fiscal quarter than in the remaining fiscal quarters 
we also recognize pre opening costs primarily in the first and fourth quarters 
summer school revenues and expenses are also recognized in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
our financial results can vary among the quarters within any fiscal year for other reasons  and our quarterly revenue and results of operations could also fluctuate somewhat based on changes in school enrollment throughout the fiscal year 
for more information on the seasonality of our financial results  see additional risk factors that may affect future results our financial results are subject to seasonal patterns and other fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year  an increase of

during the same period  we used million of cash for operating activities and million of cash for investing activities 
we have also utilized debt and equipment leasing arrangements to finance computers and other technology investments in our schools 
at june   our cash available for operations was approximately million 
on october   the company formed edison receivables company llc edison receivables for the purpose of purchasing and financing certain receivables of the company 
the company owns all of the membership interests in edison receivables  a delaware limited liability company with a separate legal existence from the company 
the company has sold or contributed certain accounts receivable arising from the company s provision of school management services in the ordinary course of its business and related security to edison receivables 
edison receivables has its own separate creditors who are entitled to be satisfied out of edison receivables assets prior to any value in it becoming available to the company 
the company has no right  title or interest in edison receivables assets  including the accounts receivable assigned to it by the company 
in november  edison receivables entered into a million revolving credit facility the mlmci facility with merrill lynch mortgage capital inc mlmci  collateralized by certain accounts receivable purchased from or contributed by the company 
borrowings are limited to specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
the mlmci facility originally had a term of one year  with interest determined on a eurodollar or prime rate basis at the company s option and a commitment fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the commitment 
as of june   million was outstanding under this line of credit bearing interest at libor plus and was collateralized by receivables with a book value of million that were sold in a true sale to edison receivables by the company 
the agreement requires that the company observe certain financial covenants and restrictions including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a maximum consolidated debt to equity ratio 
on july   the mlmci facility was amended to add school services llc school services as an additional lender and mlmci as agent of the lenders  increase the line of credit to million  and extend the term of the agreement and the line of credit provided thereunder to june  the agreement and the line of credit were subsequently extended to july  the interest rate under the amended mlmci facility was increased to libor plus or prime plus at the company s option 
we agreed to pay certain fees and costs related to the mlmci facility  aggregating approximately million 
additionally  on july  the company entered into a two year credit and security agreement the new credit facility with school services  which provides for a term loan in the amount of million  collateralized by property held by th and th associates  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and a revolving loan not to exceed million  collateralized by all the company s assets other than the property collateralizing the term loan 
interest on both the term and revolving loans was set at per annum 
the company borrowed  on july  under the new credit facility 
the facility will also be reduced by the amount of certain fees and costs which the company has agreed to pay school services and its affiliates  aggregating approximately million 
additionally  we agreed to pay a fee of million at loan maturity or the earlier prepayment of the term loan component of the facility 
this facility is secured by certain real property owned by the company and certain of its subsidiaries  notes payable from charter schools and other debtors of the company and all other assets of the company generally  other than accounts receivable sold to edison receivables 
this facility matures on june  however  the loan commitment is to be reduced by an agreed upon percentage of the net proceeds of any refinancing paid to the company 
the agreement requires the company to observe certain financial covenants and restrictions including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  a maximum consolidated debt to equity ratio and a minimum ebitda requirement for fiscal in connection with the establishment of the amended mlmci facility and the new credit facility  the company also issued warrants for the purchase of up to  shares of class a common stock of the company  which equals of the total outstanding shares of common stock of the company  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and are exercisable at any time following their issuance and prior to july  we expect our cash on hand  together with borrowings under financing arrangements  as mentioned above  and expected reimbursements of advances we have made to charter boards  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs to operate our existing schools through fiscal our near term capital needs are generally growth related and are dependent upon our rate of growth and our mix of charter schools and contract schools  as charter schools usually require us to advance funds to help charter boards obtain  renovate and complete school facilities 
we anticipate refinancing with third party lenders up to million of loans we have made to charter boards to fund our current growth plans for the school year 
while we have completed such financings in the past  we cannot be certain we will obtain such financing on favorable terms  if any 
to the extent we cannot raise sufficient funds through the refinancing of our loans to charter boards with third party lenders  we may seek additional capital through offerings of debt or equity securities and expanded financing arrangements or reduce our growth plans 
depending on the terms of any financing arrangements  such funding may be dilutive to existing shareholders  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
our longer term cash requirements are for capital to fund capital expenditures related to growth  anticipated working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
we expect to fund such expenditures and other longer term liquidity needs with cash generated from operations  the proceeds from offerings of debt or equity securities and expanded financing arrangements 
depending on the terms of any financing arrangements  such funding may be dilutive to existing shareholders  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we ran summer school programs for districts in the state of missouri during may  june and july of we spent approximately million  which includes teachers salaries  curriculum and other educational promotional materials  over the two month period 
of the amounts we recognized as revenue for the summer program  payment terms of the related billings range from to months 
therefore  cash receipts of revenue will lag outlay of cash for expenditures by more than one year 
of the amounts we recognized as revenue for the summer school program  of the revenue had been collected as of september  with the remainder scheduled for collection through january in general  our ability to achieve positive cash flow will be dependent on the volume of schools with positive gross site contribution to offset central office and overhead expenses 
because gross site contribution is the difference between site revenue and site expenditures  positive gross site contribution can be achieved at a range of enrollment levels 
while higher enrollment tends to have a positive effect on gross site contribution  our growth and cash flow do not depend on enrollment 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal  we used million for operating activities 
this use primarily resulted from a million net loss  a million net increase in working capital accounts  million increase in accrued interest on notes receivable and stock based compensation income of million  partially offset by depreciation and amortization totaling million  million of asset write off and disposals  million of notes receivable write off and allowances  impairment charges totaling million and million reduction in the carrying value of our investment in apex learning inc see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal  we used million for operating activities 
this use primarily resulted from a million net loss and a million net increase in working capital accounts  partially offset by million of depreciation and amortization   write off of accounts receivable  million in stock based compensation expense and million of asset write off and disposal 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal  we used million in investing activities 
additionally there were non cash transactions of million 
during this period  we invested million in our schools and central office 
these amounts include the investments we made in technology and curriculum in each of the schools we open 
we have also advanced funds to our charter board clients for their affiliates to help maintain and complete school facilities 
the amounts advanced during fiscal to our charter board clients or their affiliates were million 
during this period  we also received million in repayments on advances previously made 
during fiscal  we increased security deposits by million  funded a million philanthropic contribution  and incurred million of deferred contract costs 
for fiscal  we used million in investing activities 
additionally there were non cash transactions of million 
during this period  we invested million in our schools and central office 
these amounts include the investments we made in technology and curriculum in each of the schools we opened 
we have also advanced funds to our charter board clients or their affiliates to help obtain  renovate and complete school facilities 
the amounts advanced for fiscal were million 
during this period  we also received million in repayments on advances previously made 
also  we disposed of leasehold improvements totaling million 
during fiscal  we paid million for the balance on the purchase price of a lot located in the harlem section in the borough of manhattan in new york city 
additionally  we had business acquisition costs of million during the same period 
cash from financing activities for fiscal  we received million from our financing activities 
these amounts include borrowing million on our credit facility  amounts received from the exercise of stock options and warrants of million  cash received from a minority investee of million  and the release of approximately  of restricted cash 
these proceeds were partially offset by the repayments of notes payable of million and million of deferred financing costs 
for fiscal  we received million from our financing activities 
in august  we completed a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of class a common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
also in august  a philanthropic foundation exercised warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock and paid us million 
in march  we completed another public offering of an additional  shares of class a common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  we received million from exercises of stock options and warrants 
in fiscal  we received million in proceeds from financing arrangements for computers and other technology and million from facilities financings 
these proceeds were partially offset by the repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations of approximately million and million in funding of restricted cash 
philanthropy philanthropic entities supported of the schools we operated in the school year 
we tend to use philanthropy in those areas where the per pupil expenditures would otherwise make it difficult to achieve satisfactory financial performance  such as california where all of our schools have been supported by philanthropic entities 
these philanthropic entities provide funds directly to our school board or charter board clients  and not to edison 
generally  the philanthropic support helps fund the initial capital investment in curriculum  technology  and facilities necessary to open a school and is not used for ongoing annual operations 
although some of our school district and charter board clients have used philanthropic funds in the past and we expect some of them to use philanthropic funds in the future  we do not rely on philanthropic support significantly for our growth strategy 
the df foundation has supported some of our schools in california and has indicated that it intends to provide support up to million for schools operated or to be operated by us  primarily in california  million of this amount has been used to date in schools operated by us 
we issued a warrant to the df foundation to purchase up to  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additionally  we have entered into an agreement with one client whereby we committed to raise million in unrestricted philanthropic funds  to be contributed over a two year period ending june  the funds are to be used for schools the company manages and are to be expended on agreed upon costs including school facility  technology and curriculum materials 
to date  we have secured commitments from two philanthropic organizations to contribute approximately million and commitments from two senior company officers for an additional million 
during fiscal  million of commitments from the two philanthropic entities was received and we donated million 
our commitment will be amortized  net of third party donations received  over the contract life five years as a reduction in revenue 
contributions received from senior officers will serve to reduce the company s obligation and be credited to additional paid in capital 
charter school facility financings significant real estate investments are often necessary when we establish a charter school for a charter board and existing facilities are not available 
while the charter board is generally responsible for locating and financing its own school building  they typically do not have the resources required to obtain the financing necessary to secure and maintain the building 
for this reason  if we want to obtain a management agreement with the charter board  we must often help the charter board arrange for appropriate facilities 
innovative financing methods are often needed to compensate for the limited amount of state and local funding available to develop charter school facilities 
we have employed a variety of approaches  including owning or leasing the building  advancing funds for the building to the charter board under various repayment terms  or having the charter board directly own or lease the facility from a third party  sometimes assisted by a subordinated loan from us 
we also consider providing guarantees to lending institutions to allow the charter board flexibility in obtaining financing 
we determine the most economically viable option available for each school  and we purchase real estate only if we determine it is the best available financing option 
in the past  we have utilized a variety of third party financing  including bank debt  municipal bonds  sale lease back arrangements and philanthropy 
we expect to continue to advance funds to our charter board clients as well as spend  to the extent capital is available  on charter school facilities directly 
we have been successful in securing various financing arrangements in the past  but our ability to obtain any such financing arrangements in the future cannot be assured 
as of june   we had guarantees totaling million for facility related debt of three of our charter school clients  representing nine schools in fiscal the underlying debt comes due in fiscal and fiscal we could have facility financing obligations for charter schools we no longer operate because the terms of our facility financing obligations for some of our charter schools exceed the term of the management agreement for those schools 
for eight of our charter schools  we have entered into long term leases for the school facility that exceeds the current term of the management agreement by as much as years 
if our management agreements were to be terminated  or not renewed in these charter schools  our obligations to make lease payments would continue  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as of june   our aggregate future lease obligations totaled million  with varying maturities over the next years 
in nine of our charter schools  we have provided some type of permanent credit support for the school building  typically in the form of loan guarantees  loans or cash advances 
as of june   the amount of loans we had guaranteed totaled million 
although the term of these arrangements is coterminous with the term of the corresponding management agreement  our guarantee does not expire until the loan is repaid in full 
the lenders under these facilities are not committed to release us from our obligations unless replacement credit support is provided 
the default by any charter school under a credit facility that we have guaranteed could result in a claim against us for the full amount of the borrowings 
furthermore  in the event any charter board becomes insolvent or has its charter revoked  our loans and advances to the charter board may not be recoverable  which could adversely affect our financial results 
we have also set aside restricted cash as collateral  in the amount of  for the loans we guarantee 
as of june   we had advances or loans to charter school boards totaling a net of approximately million related to the purchase or renovation of school facilities we manage 
we often have not charged interest on these loans and advances 
approximately million of these loans  representing schools  are uncollateralized or subordinated to a senior lender 
we currently expect to make additional advances of at least million during the fiscal year 
if these advances or loans are not repaid when due  our financial results could be adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has written down a loan of approximately million related to a discontinued new school project 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the difficult credit environment affecting the company s ability to arrange third party lender financing coupled with the credit risk of specific charter school notes and management s intention to accelerate the refinancing of individual loans with third party lenders  an allowance for loan losses of approximately million was established 
these amounts are included in administration  curriculum and development expense in the statements of operations 
investment in apex online learning inc 
in july  we acquired a ownership interest in apex online learning inc apex  a company that provides interactive advanced placement courses for high school students over the internet 
concurrently  vulcan ventures incorporated  then the majority stockholder of apex  invested million in edison 
we initially invested million in apex and were obligated to invest up to an additional million in the future  if any third party were to invest in apex 
in december  we invested all of the additional million in apex  increasing our ownership interest at that time to 
because of the nature of our relationship with apex through june  we were required to recognize a pro rata portion of apex s losses based upon our ownership interest 
in the fiscal year ended june   we recognized million of loss as our share of apex s net loss 
we modified our relationship with apex on june  and  as a result  we are no longer accounting for this investment on the equity basis 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of our cost basis investment in apex to reflect an other than temporary decline in value of million representing the excess of carrying value over fair value  which results in a carrying value of million as of march  
we determined that our investment was impaired given the terms of a third quarter fiscal transaction involving apex equity instruments between two existing investors 
management assessed this impairment to be other than temporary based on the sharp decline in fair value as determined and in consideration of the overall market condition for private equity companies 
prior thereto  we had concluded there was not an other than temporary impairment based  in part  on its application of customary valuation techniques which indicated that fair value approximated carrying value 
among the key assumptions included in the valuation were market conditions for educational related companies  trends in apex operating results and valuations of market comparables 
anticipated capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  which includes approximately million for computers and other technology at our schools  approximately million for curriculum materials  approximately million for the purchase and improvement of property at our schools  and million for technology  leasehold improvements  and other capital items at our headquarters 
additionally  we expect to make additional advances or loans approximating million to new charter board clients to help secure and renovate school properties during the school year pursuant to our philanthropic commitments  a portion of which we expect will be refinanced through third parties 
in addition  we expect to make charitable donations of approximately million to benefit one of our clients 
additional risk factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  you should consider carefully the following risk factors 
these risks may impair our operating results and business prospects and the market price of our stock 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about the company and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance  achievements and prospects to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
you should also refer to the information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes 
we have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future we have incurred substantial net losses in every fiscal period since we began operations 
for fiscal  our net loss was million 
as of june   our accumulated deficit since november  when we converted from a partnership to a corporation  was approximately million 
in addition  prior to november  we incurred losses of approximately million  which are reflected in our additional paid in capital 
we have not yet demonstrated that we can profitably manage public schools 
in order to achieve profitability  we believe it will be necessary to improve gross site margin while maintaining educational quality and continuing to reduce central expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
we have recently undertaken a reengineering process intended to increase our efficiency and help us attain profitability while improving client service 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in meeting the objectives of the reengineering 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise additional capital and continue operations 
the private  for profit management of public schools remains a relatively new and uncertain industry  and it may not become publicly accepted our future is highly dependent upon the development  acceptance and expansion of the market for private  for profit management of public schools 
this market has only recently developed  and we are among the first companies to provide these services on a for profit basis 
we believe the first meaningful example of a school district contracting with a private company to provide core instructional services was in  and we opened our first schools in august the development of this market has been accompanied by significant press coverage and public debate concerning for profit management of public schools 
if this business model fails to gain acceptance among the general public  educators  politicians and school boards  we may be unable to grow our business and the market price of our class a common stock would be adversely affected 
the success of our business depends on our ability to improve the academic achievement of the students enrolled in our schools and we may face difficulties in doing so in the future we believe that our growth will be dependent upon our ability to demonstrate general improvements in academic performance at our schools 
our management agreements contain performance requirements related to test scores 
to the extent average student performance at our schools increases  whether due to improvements in achievement over time by individual students in our schools or changes in the average performance levels of new students entering our schools  aggregate absolute improvements in student performance will be more difficult to achieve 
if academic performance at our schools declines  is perceived to decline  or simply fails to improve  we could lose business and our reputation could be seriously damaged  which would impair our ability to gain new business or renew existing school management agreements we could incur losses at our schools if we are unable to enroll enough students because the amount of revenue we earn for operating each school primarily depends on the number of students enrolled  and because many facility and on site administrative costs are fixed  achieving site specific enrollment objectives is an important factor in our ability to achieve satisfactory financial performance at a school 
we may be unable to recruit enough students to attend all grades in our new schools or maintain enrollment at all grades in our existing schools 
we sometimes do not have enough students to fill some grades in some schools  particularly the higher grades 
it is sometimes more difficult to enroll students in the higher grades because older students and their parents are reluctant to change schools 
to the extent we are unable to meet or maintain enrollment objectives at a school  the school will be less financially successful and our financial performance will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain highly skilled principals and teachers in the numbers required to grow our business our success depends to a very high degree on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled school principals and teachers 
currently  there is a well publicized nationwide shortage of teachers and other educators in the united states 
in addition  we may find it difficult to attract and retain principals and teachers for a variety of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following we generally require our teachers to work a longer day and a longer year than most public schools  we tend to have a larger proportion of our schools in challenging locations  such as low income urban areas  which may make attracting principals and teachers more difficult  and we believe we generally impose more accountability on principals and teachers than do public schools as a whole 
these factors may increase the challenge we face in an already difficult market for attracting principals and teachers 
we have also experienced higher levels of turnover among teachers than is generally found in public schools nationally  which we attribute in part to these factors 
if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled principals and teachers in sufficient numbers  we could experience client dissatisfaction and lost growth opportunities  which would adversely affect our business 
we must open a large number of new schools in a short period of time at the beginning of each school year and  if we encounter difficulties in this process  our business and reputation could suffer it is the nature of our business that virtually all of the new schools we open in any year must be opened within a few weeks of each other at the beginning of the school year 
each new school must be substantially functional when students arrive on the first day of school 
this is a difficult logistical and management challenge  and the period of concentrated activity preceding the opening of the school year places a significant strain on our management and operational functions 
we expect this strain will increase if we are successful in securing larger numbers of school management agreements in the future 
if we fail to successfully open schools by the required date  we could lose school management agreements  incur financial losses and our reputation as well as our ability to attract future clients would be damaged 
we depend upon cooperative relationships with teachers unions  both at the local and national levels union cooperation at the local level is often critical to us in obtaining new management agreements and renewing existing management agreements 
in those school districts subject to collective bargaining  provisions of collective bargaining agreements must typically be modified in areas such as length of school day  length of school year  negotiated compensation policies and prescribed methods of evaluation in order to implement the edison design at a contract school 
we regularly encounter resistance from local teachers unions during school board debates over whether to enter into a management agreement with us 
in addition  local teachers unions have occasionally  albeit ultimately unsuccessfully  initiated litigation challenging our management agreements 
if we fail to achieve and maintain cooperative relationships with local teachers unions  we could lose business and our ability to grow could suffer 
in addition  at the national level  the american federation of teachers and the national education association have substantial financial and other resources that could be used to influence legislation  local teachers unions and public opinion in a way that would hurt our business 
we could be liable for events that occur at our schools we could become liable for the actions of principals  teachers and other personnel in our schools 
in the event of on site accidents  injuries or other harm to students  we could face claims alleging that we were negligent  provided inadequate supervision or were otherwise liable for the injury 
we could also face allegations that teachers or other personnel committed child abuse  sexual abuse or other criminal acts 
in addition  if our students commit acts of violence  we could face allegations that we failed to provide adequate security or were otherwise responsible for their actions  particularly in light of recent highly publicized incidents of school violence 
although we maintain liability insurance  this insurance coverage may not be adequate to fully protect us from these kinds of claims 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our liability insurance in the future at reasonable prices or at all 
a successful liability claim could injure our reputation and hurt our financial results 
even if unsuccessful  such a claim could cause unfavorable publicity  entail substantial expense and divert the time and attention of key management personnel  which could cause our financial results to suffer 
our management agreements with school districts and charter boards are terminable under specified circumstances and generally expire after a term of five years our management agreements generally have a term of five years 
we cannot be assured that any management agreements will be renewed at the end of their terms 
in addition  some of our management agreements may be terminated by the school district or charter board at will  with or without good reason  and all of our management agreements may be terminated for cause  including in some cases for failure to meet specified educational standards  such as academic performance based on standardized test scores 
as a result of payment disputes or changes within a school district  such as changes in the political climate  we do from time to time face pressure to permit a school district or charter board to terminate our management agreement even if they do not have a legal right to do so 
we may also seek the early termination of  or not seek to renew  a limited number of management agreements in any year 
if a significant number of management contracts are not renewed or are terminated  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our largest management agreement to date is terminable at will by the client and under other specified circumstances on august   the company signed an agreement to manage schools in philadelphia 
it is our largest cluster of schools to date 
this agreement has been and continues to be the subject of substantial attention in education and business circles as well as in the local and national press 
the contract is subject to termination at will by the school district 
the contract is also subject to termination if we fail to meet our obligations  including meeting specified student achievement targets 
if the contract is terminated  or if we fail to successfully deliver the program  raise student achievement or manage the program s costs  our financial results  operations and reputation may be adversely affected 
our management agreements involve financial risk under the majority of our management agreements  we agree to operate a school in return for per pupil funding that generally does not vary with our actual costs 
to the extent our actual costs under a management agreement exceed our budgeted costs  or our actual revenue is less than planned because we are unable to enroll as many students as we anticipated or for any other reason  we could lose money at that school 
in addition  from time to time we have disagreements with our clients as to the actual amount of  or the method of calculating  the revenue owed to us under the terms of the management agreements  resulting in lower revenue than planned 
we are generally obligated by our management agreements to continue operating a school for the duration of the contract even if it becomes unprofitable to do so 
we have limited experience operating four year high schools an element of our strategy is to increase our business with existing customers by opening new schools in school districts with whom we have an existing relationship 
an important aspect of this strategy is to open edison high schools in districts in which we operate elementary and middle schools 
because we have limited experience operating high schools  our complete high school curriculum  school design and operating plan are not fully tested 
in addition  school districts typically spend more per pupil on high school education than on elementary education 
by contrast  some of our management agreements provide that we recognize for each student  regardless of grade level  the average per pupil funding spent by the school district for all grade levels 
for this reason  in these schools we recognize less funding per high school student than is spent by the school district for each of its high school students 
in these situations  our success depends upon our ability to deliver our high school design based on the same per pupil spending as in our elementary schools 
if we are unable to successfully and profitably operate high schools  our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be impaired  which could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
our lengthy sales cycle and uncertainties inherent in the process through which we develop new business could delay new business and affect our rate of growth the time between initial contact with a potential contract or charter client and the ultimate opening of a school  and related recognition of revenue  typically ranges between and months 
our sales cycle for contract schools is generally lengthy due to the approval process at the local school board level  the political sensitivity of converting a public school to private management and the need  in some circumstances  for cooperation from local unions 
we also have a lengthy sales cycle for charter schools for similar reasons  as well as the need to arrange for facilities to house the school 
in addition  we are increasingly presented with potential opportunities to take over the management of several schools in a single district or area at the same time  which likewise have a lengthy sales cycle 
the outcome of these opportunities can have a meaningful effect on our rate of growth 
as a result of our lengthy sales cycle  we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of new management agreements 
any delay in completing  or failure to complete  management agreements could hurt our financial performance 
press speculation concerning the outcome of these processes may adversely affect our stock price from time to time 
we could lose money if we underestimate the real estate costs associated with acquiring or renovating a charter school if we incur unexpected real estate cost overruns in acquiring or renovating a charter school  we could lose money in operating the school 
our decision to enter into a management agreement for a charter school and our estimate of the financial performance of the charter school  are based  in part  on the estimated facility financing cost associated with renovating an existing facility or building a new facility to house the charter school 
this cost varies widely from minimal amounts for minor upgrades to larger amounts for a new construction  which typically range from million to million  per facility 
if these expenses exceed our estimates for the charter school  the charter school could lose money and our financial results would be adversely affected 
we have advanced and loaned money to charter school boards that may not be repaid as of june   we have outstanding loans or advances to charter boards of million  net of allowances  to finance the purchase or renovation of school facilities we manage 
approximately million of these loans  representing schools  are uncollateralized or subordinated to a senior lender 
in addition  with respect to the loans that are collateralized  if we were required to foreclose on the collateral securing those loans  we might not be able to liquidate the collateral for proceeds sufficient to cover the loan amount 
if any of these advances or loans are not repaid when due  our financial results could be adversely affected 
some of our charter schools recently obtained tax exempt financing to repay these loans and advances  but there can be no assurance that our other charter schools will be able to obtain such tax exempt financing 
while we are currently exploring a variety of other financing structures to assist charter schools in repaying these loans and advances  there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement any of these financing structures 
we could become liable for financial obligations of charter boards we could have facility financing obligations for charter schools we no longer operate  because the terms of our facility financing obligations for some of our charter schools exceeds the term of the management agreement for those schools 
for nine of our charter schools  we have entered into a long term lease for the school facility that exceeds the current term of the management agreement by as much as years 
if our management agreements were to be terminated  or not renewed in these charter schools  our obligations to make lease payments would continue  which could adversely affect our financial results 
for example  as of december  we terminated a management agreement covering three schools for which we continue to have a long term lease obligation in connection with the school s facilities 
although we have signed a lease with the school covering the school year  we have no assurance that that lease will be renewed or that we will be able to find other tenants to lease the facility 
as of june   our aggregate future lease obligations totaled million  with varying maturities over the next years 
in nine of our charter schools  we have provided some type of permanent credit support for the school building  typically in the form of loan guarantees or cash advances 
as of june  the amount of loans we had guaranteed totaled million 
although the term of these arrangements is coterminous with the term of the corresponding management agreement  our guarantee does not expire until the loan is repaid in full 
the lenders under these facilities are not committed to release us from our obligations unless replacement credit support is provided 
the default by any charter school under a credit facility that we have guaranteed could result in a claim against us for the full amount of the borrowings 
furthermore  in the event any charter board becomes insolvent or has its charter revoked  our loans and advances to the charter board may not be recoverable  which could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we have generally indemnified our charter school and contract school partners from any liability or damages occurring or allegedly occurring or arising out of any environmental conditions at the school site  if such conditions were caused or created by substances brought on the site by edison 
our financial results are subject to seasonal patterns and other fluctuations from quarter to quarter we expect our results of operations to experience seasonal patterns and other fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
the factors that could contribute to fluctuations  which could have the effect of masking or exaggerating trends in our business and which could hurt the market price of our class a common stock  include because new schools are opened in the first fiscal quarter of each year  increases in student enrollment and related revenue and expenses will first be reflected in that quarter 
subsequent to the first quarter  student enrollment is expected to remain relatively stable throughout a school year  and  accordingly  trends in our business  whether favorable or unfavorable  will tend not to be reflected in our quarterly financial results  but will be evident primarily in year to year comparisons 
we recognize revenue for each managed school pro rata over the months from august through june  typically the period over which we perform our services and  except for revenue related to our summer school programs  we recognize no school revenue in july 
most of our site costs are also recognized over the months from august through june 
for this reason  the first quarter of our fiscal year has historically reflected less revenue and lower expenses than the other three quarters  and we expect this pattern to continue 
our recognition of site related expenses in the first fiscal quarter is proportionally greater than the revenue recognition because some site expenses are incurred in july and no revenue is recorded in july  with the exception of revenue related to our summer school programs 
this results in lower gross site margin in the first fiscal quarter than in the remaining fiscal quarters 
we also recognize pre opening costs primarily in the first and fourth quarters 
we recognize revenue from our summer school programs during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent our summer school program becomes a more significant part of our business  this could significantly alter seasonal patterns 
our financial results can vary among the quarters within any fiscal year for other reasons  including unexpected enrollment changes  greater than expected costs of opening schools or delays in opening new schools 
we expect our market to become more competitive we expect the market for providing private  for profit management of public schools will become increasingly competitive 
currently  we compete with a relatively small number of companies that provide these services  and they have to date primarily focused on the operation of charter schools 
some of these companies have begun to compete with us for contract schools 
in addition  a variety of other types of companies and entities could enter the market  including colleges and universities  private companies that operate higher education or professional education schools 
our existing competitors and new market entrants could have financial  marketing and other resources significantly greater than ours 
we also compete for public school funding with existing public schools  who may elect not to enter into management agreements with private managers or who may pursue alternative reform initiatives  such as magnet schools and inter district choice programs 
in addition  in jurisdictions where voucher programs have been authorized  we will begin to compete with existing private schools for public tuition funds 
voucher programs provide for the issuance by local or other governmental bodies of tuition vouchers to parents worth a certain amount of money that they can redeem at any approved school of their choice  including private schools 
if we are unable to compete successfully against any of these existing or potential competitors  our revenues could be reduced  resulting in increased losses 
failure to raise necessary additional capital could restrict our growth and hinder our ability to compete we have had negative cash flow in every fiscal period since we began operations 
we have regularly needed to raise funds in order to operate our business and fund our growth  including the construction and renovation of charter school facilities  and may need to raise additional funds in the future 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  or that our charter clients will be able to repay our loans and advances to them 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities  stockholders may experience dilution or the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of class a common stock 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  or if our charter clients are unable to repay our loans and advances to them  or if we are required to repay any loans that we have guaranteed  we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business 
the terms of our credit agreements impose significant restrictions on our business under the mlmci facility and the new credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet future financial ratios and comply with other covenants can be affected by events beyond our control  such as general economic conditions 
our failure to comply with such covenants would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts under our credit facilities and could result in a default under those facilities  which could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the facilities to become immediately due and payable 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations  we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness  seek additional equity capital or sell assets 
we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms  or at all 
we have issued warrants for the purchase of class a common stock in connection with certain credit facilities that  if exercised  will dilute our current equity holders and could have an adverse effect on the market price for the shares of class a common stock warrants issued in connection with the establishment of the credit facilities are for the purchase of up to  shares of class a common stock at per share 
the shares to be issued in connection with the warrants equal approximately of the total outstanding shares of common stock of the company  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants but prior to any resale of such shares by the holders 
the issuance of such shares will dilute the current stockholders of the company and could have an adverse effect on the market price for the shares of class a common stock 
in addition  the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are being registered pursuant to a registration statement  and any sales of such shares may have a further adverse effect on the market price for the shares of the class a common stock 
we may not be able to recover the property value associated with our termination of the edison corporate headquarters project we previously purchased property in new york  new york for the purchase price of million  and entered into an agreement with the museum of african art to develop the property for a mixed use project consisting of our new corporate headquarters  a charter school and a facility to house the museum 
we recently terminated our plans to develop this property and construct new corporate headquarters 
accordingly  we may choose to sell the property to the museum or another third party 
while we hope to be able to sell the property at a price equal to or greater than our purchase price  we have no guarantee that we will be able to do so  and may choose to sell the property at a loss 
we rely on government funds for specific education programs  and our business could suffer if we fail to comply with rules concerning the receipt and use of the funds we benefit from funds from federal and state programs to be used for specific educational purposes 
funding from the federal government under title i of the elementary and secondary education act  which provides federal funds for children from low income families  accounted for approximately of our gross student funding revenue for fiscal during the same period  we estimate that funding from other federal and state programs accounted for approximately an additional of our total revenue 
a number of factors relating to these government programs could lead to adverse effects on our business and financial results these programs have strict requirements as to eligible students and allowable activities 
if we or our school district and charter board clients fail to comply with the regulations governing the programs  we or our clients could be required to repay the funds or be determined ineligible to receive these funds 
if the income demographics of a district s population were to change over the life of our management agreement for a school in the district  resulting in a decrease in title i funding for the school  we would recognize less revenue for operating the school 
funding from federal and state education programs is allocated through formulas 
if federal or state legislatures or  in some case  agencies were to change the formulas  we could receive less funding 
federal  state and local education programs are subject to annual appropriations of funds 
federal or state legislatures or local officials could drastically reduce the funding amount of appropriation for any program  thus decreasing the amount of funding available to us 
the company s edison extra summer school program  which served approximately  students in missouri during the summer of  is funded through state summer school funds 
if the missouri state government fails to maintain current funding levels for summer school programs  edison extra revenue would be adversely affected 
most federal education funds are administered through state and local education agencies  which allot funds to school boards and charter boards 
these state and local education agencies are subject to extensive government regulation concerning their eligibility for federal funds 
if these agencies were declared ineligible to receive federal education funds  the receipt of federal education funds by our school board or charter board clients could be delayed  which could in turn delay our payment from our school board and charter board clients 
the federal no child left behind act of  which includes the title i program referenced above  contains a range of new accountability measures for public schools 
schools that fail to make adequate yearly progress ayp toward meeting state standards may lose some of their student enrollment due to school choice provisions  may be required to allocate a portion of their title i funding toward the provision of supplemental services to some students  and may be subject to state takeover or other forms of district or state intervention 
if schools run by the company fail to make ayp  these new requirements could adversely affect the company s revenue and or reputation 
we are subject to extensive government regulation because we benefit from federal funds  and our failure to comply with government regulations could result in the reduction or loss of federal education funds because we benefit from federal funds  we must also comply with a variety of federal laws and regulations not directly related to any federal education program  such as federal civil rights laws and laws relating to lobbying 
our failure to comply with these federal laws and regulations could result in the reduction or loss of federal education funds 
in addition  our management agreements are potentially covered by federal procurement rules and regulations because our school district and charter board clients pay us  in part  with funds received from federal programs 
federal procurement rules and regulations generally require competitive bidding  awarding contracts based on lowest cost and similar requirements 
if a court or federal agency determined that a management agreement was covered by federal procurement rules and regulations and was awarded without compliance with those rules and regulations  then the management agreement could be voided and we could be required to repay any federal funds we received under the management agreement 
failure of our charter board clients to obtain federal tax exempt status could jeopardize the school s charter and restrict our ability to finance the school many of our charter school clients apply for federal tax exempt status 
one state in which we currently operate seven charter schools and hope to open additional charter schools in the future  and one other state  requires charter schools to secure federal tax exempt status 
one of our charter school clients in the first state received notice from the internal revenue service of an appealable denial of its application for federal tax exempt status 
while this charter school client was ultimately successful in obtaining tax exempt status  there can be no assurance that other charter school clients will not experience difficulty in obtaining such status 
any failure to receive or delay in receiving federal tax exempt status by a charter school in this state could jeopardize the school s charter and its ability to repay amounts owed to us 
the failure to receive federal tax exempt status by a charter school in any state could also  among other things  inhibit that charter school s ability to solicit charitable contributions or participate in tax exempt financing 
we earn all of our revenue from public sources and any reduction in general funding levels for education could hurt our business all of our revenue is derived from public sources 
if general levels of funding for public education were to decline  the field of school districts in which we could profitably operate schools would likewise diminish  and our ability to grow by adding new schools would suffer 
in addition  our management agreements generally provide that we bear the risk of lower levels of per pupil funding  which would be directly reflected in lower revenue to us  even if our costs do not decline accordingly  thus adversely affecting our financial results 
restrictions on government funding of for profit school management companies could hurt our business any restriction on the use of federal or state government educational funds by for profit companies could hurt our business and our ability to grow 
from time to time  a variety of proposals have been introduced in state legislatures to restrict or prohibit the management of public schools by private  for profit entities like us 
for example  a recently passed bill in california prohibits the state department of education from contracting with a private  for profit education manager to manage public schools for which the state assumes control pursuant to a new state educational reform measure 
additionally  idaho s charter school law may  subject to interpretation  restrict our ability to manage schools in that state 
to the extent that states or the federal government were to adopt legislation prohibiting for profit entities from operating public schools  the market for our services would decline and our business results could suffer 
the operation of our charter schools depends on the maintenance of the underlying charter grant our charter schools operate under a charter that is typically granted by a state authority to a third party charter holder  such as a community group or established non profit organization 
our management agreement in turn is with the charter holder 
if the state charter authority were to revoke the charter  which could occur based on actions of the charter holder outside of our control  we would lose the right to operate that school 
in addition  many state charter school statutes require periodic reauthorization 
charter schools accounted for of our gross student funding in fiscal  or approximately million 
if state charter school legislation were not reauthorized or were substantially altered in a meaningful number of states  our business and growth strategy would suffer and we could incur additional losses 
our stock price has been volatile and we expect it to continue to be volatile in the future the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to the risks discussed above  as well as other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these other factors include variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in the public perception of our schools academic performance  termination or non renewal of existing management agreements  changes in market valuations of similar companies  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders  pending and potential litigation  future sales of our class a common stock or other securities  and general stock market volatility 
since our class a common stock has been publicly traded  its market price has fluctuated over a wide range and we expect it to continue to do so in the future 
we have been named in several shareholder class action and shareholders derivative lawsuits 
we have been named in several putative class actions lawsuits filed in the southern district of new york  and a few shareholder derivative actions  also filed in new york 
we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful  and an adverse resolution of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuits are resolved 
we are not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses  if any  related to the lawsuits 
lawsuits may cause defaults under our material agreements  prevent us from obtaining additional funds under our existing line of credit or obtain additional financing  and such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
we may face additional securities litigation or other litigation in addition to the securities class action litigation currently being brought against us as more fully described in the risk factor above  we may also in the future be the target of similar litigation 
additional securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
we may also face other types of litigation 
for example  the company and a private pension fund were unable to close a proposed financing transaction and the company chose instead to do a transaction with school services llc 
the company could face litigation in connection with that decision 
while we intend to vigorously defend against any such lawsuit  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful  and an adverse resolution of any lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  shareholder equity  and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuits are resolved 
we must comply with the terms of a settlement agreement entered into by the company and the securities and exchange commission on may   the company entered into a settlement agreement with the securities and exchange commission  pursuant to which the company agreed to enhance disclosure of its revenue recognition practices  by adopting a statement of operations presentation that includes a line item for gross student funding  as well as full disclosure of all expenses paid by edison and all expenses paid by the local districts  and its internal accounting system by creating an internal audit department 
the company intends to fully comply with the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement 
however  if we fail to comply with the settlement agreement  or are perceived by the securities and exchange commission to have failed to comply  we may face additional scrutiny from the commission  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could result in a limited public market for our class a common stock on august   we received notice from nasdaq that the price of our class a common stock had closed below the minimum per share for consecutive trading days as required for continued listing under nasdaq s marketplace rules 
the notification letter stated that we had days  or until november   to regain compliance with the rule  ie  for our securities to close above for ten consecutive trading days 
in and of itself  the notification letter does not result in delisting  under nasdaq s rules  on receipt of a staff determination letter which the company has not received  an issuer may file and argue for an extension or exception to nasdaq s listing requirements  and the association may grant such extensions or exceptions where it deems appropriate 
delisting from the nasdaq market could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our class a common stock and could have a long term impact on our ability to raise future capital 
additionally  nasdaq s listing requirements provide that companies must have an audit committee composed of at least three independent directors 
on the advice of their legal advisors  three of our directors who are affiliates of school services resigned from the board of directors prior to the time that we and school services entered into material negotiations regarding the credit and security agreement between the company and school services 
two of these directors were members of the audit committee 
as a result  we currently do not have an audit committee  although we are actively seeking qualified candidates to serve on our audit committee 
delisting from the nasdaq national market could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our class a common stock and it could have a long term impact on our ability to raise future capital 
anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter and bylaws could prevent or delay a change in control provisions of delaware law  our charter and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of class a common stock  and could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us 
these provisions include the high vote nature of our class b common stock  restrictions on removal of directors  which may only be effected for cause and only by a vote of the holders of of our class of common stock that elected the director  section of the general corporation law of delaware which could have the effect of delaying transactions with interested stockholders  a prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  and procedural and notice requirements for calling and bringing action before stockholder meetings item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates 
as disclosed in note of the notes to our financial statements  we had outstanding long term notes payable of million and million at june  and  respectively 
interest rates on the notes are fixed and range from to per annum and have terms of to months 
we do not believe that we have significant exposure to changing interest rates on long term debt because interest rates for our debt is fixed 
we have not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and are not a party to any other interest rate market risk management activities 
additionally  we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively 
we invest cash mainly in money market accounts and other investment grade securities 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
