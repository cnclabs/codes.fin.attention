item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events  including  among other things 
implementing our business strategy  
attracting and retaining new customers  
obtaining and expanding our market presence in new geographic regions  
the availability and cost of high quality arabica coffee beans  
consumers tastes and preferences  and 
competition in our market 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  could  predict  potential  continue  expect  anticipate  future  intend  plan  believe  estimate and similar expressions or the negative of such expressions 
these statements are based on our current beliefs  expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results  levels of activity  performance  achievements and events may vary significantly from those implied by the forward looking statements 
a description of risks that could cause our results to vary appears under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
company overview and industry outlook peet s is a specialty coffee roaster and marketer of branded fresh roasted whole bean coffee sold through multiple channels of distribution 
since the founding of our business in  we have established a customer base and brand recognition in california 
our national expansion strategy is based on the sale of whole bean coffee in multiple channels of distribution 
while we intend to continue the sale of whole bean coffee through strategically located retail stores  we expect revenue in our other distribution channels  namely specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  online and mail order and office  restaurant and food service accounts  to increase as a percent of our revenue 
we are also expanding internationally through strategic relationships 
we expect the specialty coffee industry to continue to grow 
we believe that this growth will be fueled by continued consumer interest in high quality coffee and related products 
our operations are vertically integrated 
we purchase arabica coffee beans from countries around the world  apply our artisan roasting techniques and ship fresh coffee daily to our stores and customers within hours of roasting 
control of purchasing  roasting  packaging and distribution of our coffee allows us to maintain our commitment to freshness  is cost effective and enhances our margins and profit potential 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies 
inventory 
raw materials consist primarily of green bean coffee and finished goods include roasted coffee  tea  accessory products  spices  and packaged foods 
all products are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  except green bean and roasted coffee  which is valued at the average cost 
we continually evaluate the composition of our coffee related merchandise and mark down such inventory as needed 
our historical inventory write offs have been immaterial 

long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 

income taxes 
we have significant federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards 
the utilization of these carryforwards is dependent on future income 
we have established a valuation allowance for the portion of the carryforwards that we do not expect to utilize 
although we believe the valuation allowance is appropriate  if future taxable income were to differ significantly from the amounts estimated  the valuation allowance would need to be adjusted 

hedge accounting 
we use coffee futures and options to hedge price increases in price to be fixed coffee purchase commitments and anticipated coffee purchases 
these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
hedge accounting is permitted if the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective 
effectiveness is determined by how closely the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
if the derivative is determined to qualify for hedge accounting  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the related hedged item is sold 
the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded directly to earnings 
if these derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting  we would have to record the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments directly to earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we have also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the intrinsic value method or apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock option awards 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using the alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
business segments our coffee and related items are sold through multiple channels of distribution that are considered separate segments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these channels provide broad market exposure to potential purchasers of fresh roasted whole bean coffee 
we sell coffee beans and related items through three reportable segments 
our retail stores  
online and mail order  and 
specialty sales  which consist of sales to specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  restaurant and food service companies  and office accounts 
we intend to increase sales by focusing on expansion in specialty sales  as well as through continued growth of our online and mail order channel 
although our expansion into new distribution channels is accelerating  we believe it is disciplined and focused  only penetrating new markets and channels that we believe can support the sale of specialty coffee 
we also intend to open a limited number of new stores in strategic locations that meet our demographic profile  and explore potential opportunities for franchising and licensing in international markets 
our focus on specialty sales and online and mail order is driven by the higher net margins and lower capital expense in those segments 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue from specialty sales and online and mail order segments 
our long term objective is to generate approximately half of our revenue from the specialty sales and online and mail order channels 
business categories in addition to our reportable segments  we measure our business by monitoring the volume and revenue growth of two distinct business categories 
whole bean coffee and related products  and 
beverages and pastries 
we believe these business categories are useful in understanding our results of operations for the periods presented because we operate our stores and record sales through these two categories 
our stores are primarily designed to facilitate the sale of whole bean coffee 
the format of our stores replicates that of a specialty grocer 
beans are scooped from under the counter bins  weighed on counter top scales and hand packed into branded bags 
in addition  each store has a beverage bar that is dedicated to the sale of prepared beverages and pastries 
in addition  our two business categories within a store mature at different rates 
when we open a store  the initial sales are primarily beverage and pastry related 
the distance a consumer will travel  or trade area  for beverages and pastries is short usually one to three miles  representing a convenience purchase 
consequently  the beverage and pastry business matures rapidly 
the trade area for whole bean coffee is much larger usually three to five miles  representing destination shopping 
consequently  whole bean sales from stores mature more slowly typically three to five years 
therefore  sales at newer stores have a much higher beverage and pastry component and shift to a higher whole bean percentage as the store matures 
the dynamics of opening many new stores over the past few years have resulted in a higher beverage and pastry percentage within our net revenue 
the following chart demonstrates our business category mix for retail store sales in  expressed as a percent of retail revenue 
open less than open to open more years years than years whole bean coffee and related products beverages and pastries results of operations the following discussion on results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year is based on a or week year 
the fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to the last day of december 
the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated 
year statement of operations data as a percent of net revenue net revenue cost of sales and related occupancy expenses operating expenses marketing and advertising expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses income loss from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss percent of net revenue by business segment retail stores online and mail order specialty sales percent of net revenue by business category whole bean coffee and related products beverages and pastries operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue retail stores online and mail order specialty sales percent increase decrease from prior year net revenue retail stores online and mail order specialty sales cost of sales and related occupancy expenses operating expenses marketing and advertising expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses selected operating data number of retail stores in operation beginning of the period store openings store closure end of the period pounds of whole bean coffee sold in thousands    compared with net revenue net revenue for increased for all three segments and both business categories as compared to during  we continued our strategy of selling through multiple channels of distribution 
a key element of our strategy involves increasing the percentage of revenue from sales of whole bean coffee and related products  which have a higher net margin than beverages and pastries 
we expect that an increase in the percentage of whole bean and related product revenue will occur over the long term due to the slow maturation of whole bean coffee sales at newer retail stores and the growth of online and mail order and specialty sales segments 
thus  revenue derived from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue actually decreased slightly in from to  primarily as a result of the opening of retail stores over the past three years 
in the retail segment  we continued to increase revenue primarily as a result of increased sales in existing stores  price increases on whole bean coffee and beverages and pastries effective in december  the opening of new retail stores and the introduction of a line of high end reserve coffees 
during  we opened two new stores compared to five stores opened in one was in studio city  southern california  and the other was in wellesley  massachusetts 
we opened fewer new stores in because the cost and availability of real estate was less attractive during and the first half of the following table sets forth the sources of revenue increases in by business category for the retail segment in millions 
increased volume and change in mix of whole bean coffee 
price increase in december total existing stores total new stores total whole bean coffee and related products increased volume of beverages and pastries price increase in december total existing stores total new stores total beverages and pastries in the online and mail order segment  revenue increased primarily as a result of selected customer acquisition efforts and customer retention programs 
during  our active customers  or those who had ordered at least once during the year  increased to  from  in during  we continued our sales initiatives in the specialty sales segment and increased revenue for that segment by 
the million increase consisted of million in incremental sales to specialty groceries and gourmet food stores  a million increase in sales to restaurants and food service companies  and million in additional sales to office accounts 
we increased the number of specialty grocery and gourmet food stores from in to over in  including multi location chains such as von s pavilion  beverages more and larry s markets 
in the restaurant and food service area  we entered into agreements with companies such as the wolfgang puck fine dining and catering group and anton airfoods 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses consist of product costs  including hedging costs  manufacturing costs  rent and other occupancy costs 
primarily as a result of increased net revenue and the addition of two new stores  cost of sales increased by in the lower cost of green bean coffee was partially offset by higher hedging costs 
cost of sales actually decreased as a percent of net revenue mainly because of 
the december price increase  which resulted in a higher average sale at our retail store beverage bars and a higher price per pound of whole bean coffee purchased at our retail stores and by online and mail order customers  
sales of high end reserve coffees  which have a higher margin than regular menu coffees  and 
fewer new stores being opened during these benefits were partially offset by the increase in revenue from the specialty sales segment  which has a lower price point than retail and a higher shipping cost 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased as compared to as we grew our business  however  operating expenses as a percent of net revenue decreased primarily due to the increase in our net revenue and a payroll reduction initiative affecting our retail stores 
this initiative involved a reduction in store hours and pay rates and we believe was primarily responsible for the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of retail revenue 
in addition  we held expenses constant for the online and mail order segment while growing revenue 
the decrease in online and mail order operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue consisted of decreases from outside service expense  payroll expense  and order processing expense 
our focus on growing the specialty sales segment led to an increase in specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue 
the factors contributing to the increase included the payroll expense of new sales staff for the grocery segment expansion  their travel and related expenses  the expenses related to distribution  and the pre opening and startup costs related to the opening of kiosks in larry s markets stores in seattle 
marketing and advertising expenses the decrease in marketing and advertising expenses in as compared to is attributable to the leverage gained from marketing across multiple channels of distribution  a shift from customer acquisition to customer retention  which is generally more cost effective  and fewer new store openings in general and administrative expenses we were able to reduce our general and administrative expenses as a percent of net revenue in as compared to primarily by maintaining prior year employee base levels and lowering recruiting expenses in a less competitive job market 
our efforts to reduce general and administrative expenses were partially offset by higher outside services expenses related to stock plan administration and public relations activities associated with being a publicly held company 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in as compared to due to the openings of new stores and kiosks and investments in manufacturing and systems 
however  as a percent of net revenue  these expenses decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to fewer stores being opened as well as the increase in revenue from the less capital intensive specialty sales channel 
interest expense  net net interest expense decreased in as compared to as a result of repayment of debt using the net proceeds from our initial public offering in january income tax provision benefit taxes on net income in were million  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective rate over the prior year is attributable to the increase in income and the change in the valuation allowance of charitable contributions carryforwards 
compared with net revenue net revenue in increased for all three segments and both business categories as compared to net revenue 
in  we initiated our strategy of selling through multiple channels of distribution 
because of the retail stores we opened in and  revenue derived from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue decreased slightly in due to the slower maturation of whole bean coffee sales compared to beverage and pastry sales 
the multi channel strategy resulted in the increase in the specialty sales segment as a percent of revenue from to and led to the lower percent of net revenue from both the retail segment and the online and mail order segment 
in the retail segment  we continued to increase revenue primarily as a result of increased sales in existing stores  price increases on whole bean coffee and beverages and pastries effective in august and the opening of new retail stores 
during  we opened five new stores compared to stores opened in the following table sets forth the sources of revenue increases by business category for the retail segment in millions 
increased volume of whole bean coffee price increase in august total existing stores total new stores total whole bean coffee and related products increased volume of beverages and pastries price increase in august total existing stores total new stores total beverages and pastries in the online and mail order segment  revenue increased primarily due to the growth of our customer base as a result of increased direct mail and online marketing efforts and the august price increase 
in the specialty sales segment  we launched a new sales initiative  which resulted in the million increase in revenue for this segment 
the expansion of our office coffee program represented million of the increase while restaurant and food service accounts represented million 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses increased in as compared to primarily as a result of the addition of five new stores and increased volume of in whole bean coffee sales 
as a percent of revenue  cost of sales and related occupancy expenses decreased to from  mainly because of the august price increase and the reduction in our average green coffee bean cost by per pound 
these benefits were partially offset by higher occupancy costs for new stores opened in boston 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million in as compared to and also increased as a percent of net revenue to in from in the majority of this increase was the result of an increase in retail store operating expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percent of segment revenue 
the increased retail store operating expenses were mainly due to the increased costs of entering into new markets  the additional expense incurred for the implementation of a new store wide electronic point of sale system and increased labor costs in california 
retail store operating expenses in new markets averaged of revenue due mainly to lower per store revenue in non mature locations  compared to of revenue for mature locations 
these increased costs in connection with entering new markets contributed approximately million to the overall increase in retail store operating expenses 
the increase in retail store operating expenses also consisted of million from the implementation of the point of sale system and million from increased labor costs in california  with the remaining increase caused by the required support for revenue growth in retail operations 
in the online and mail order segment  our operating expenses increased mainly because of increased spending on information systems necessary to support higher volume and online presence 
in the specialty sales segment  the increase in operating expenses resulted from the hiring of new sales staff and the cost of the expanded sales program for office  restaurant and food service accounts 
marketing and advertising expenses marketing and advertising expenses increased significantly in over the prior year due to new store additions in boston  chicago and portland and increased online and mail order programs  as well as increased marketing efforts for office and restaurant accounts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased slightly in as compared to as a result of the hiring of additional administrative personnel but decreased slightly as a percent of net revenue primarily due to higher sales 
depreciation and amortization expenses the increase in depreciation and amortization in as compared to was primarily the result of capital expenditures for new retail stores and system upgrades 
interest expense  net the increase in net interest expense in as compared to was primarily due to the additional borrowings under our credit facility to fund and support expansion and additional working capital needs 
income tax provision benefit taxes on income for reflect a benefit of million resulting from recognition of the future tax benefit of the fiscal year loss 
the effective tax rate of reflects the establishment of a valuation allowance on charitable contribution carryforwards and the california disallowance of of the current year tax net operating loss carryforward 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
our capital requirements in were funded primarily through cash flows from operations  borrowings under our line of credit  and proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock in january net cash provided by operations was million in operating cash flows were positively impacted by increased net income  adjusted for deprecation and amortization 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in green coffee bean inventory as we increased our purchases in response to historically low coffee prices 
net cash used in investing activities was million in investing activities primarily consisted of million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  including 
million used for the purchase of equipment that was previously leased  
million used for the opening of two new stores in southern california and massachusetts and six new kiosks in larry s markets in washington state  
million used for information technology support systems and website development  
million used for existing store upgrades  and 
million used for manufacturing plant capacity and machinery upgrades 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in financing activities in consisted primarily of million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering and exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments of million of outstanding debt 
we have a credit facility with general electric capital corporation  that provides for a revolving line of credit of million and provided for a term a loan for million payable over five years and a term b loan for million with principal due in february upon the closing of our initial public offering  both the term a and term b loans were repaid 
at december   we had million available under the revolving line of credit after borrowings of million and other senior funded debt of million 
due to the significant repayment of debt from the net proceeds of our initial public offering  we amended our existing credit facility in june and march effective december  to reflect our updated cash and capital requirements 
the march amendment includes an increase in the capital expenditure limit and an increase of the limit on the number of new stores per year 
in addition  interest rates on the revolving line of credit have been reduced 
our capital expenditure requirements consist primarily of expenditures relating to new store openings  remodeling of existing stores  and the upgrade of our merchandise ordering and fulfillment system 
our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
approximately million is expected to be used for the opening of five to eight new retail stores 
the remaining million in capital expenditures is expected to be used for the remodeling of existing stores  the upgrade of our ordering and fulfillment system and the upgrade of other plant and office facilities 
the following table set forth below reflects our contractual cash obligations and our other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years line of credit   long term borrowings  capital lease obligations retail store operating leases      fixed price coffee purchase commitments    total contractual cash obligations      in addition  as of december   we have an outstanding standby letter of credit of million backing the long term borrowings 
we expect cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our current line of credit to be sufficient for our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and to meet our contractual obligations as they come due 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions or for competitive reasons  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the implementation and success of our business strategy  competitive conditions in the specialty coffee market  and general economic conditions 
please see risk factors below for a discussion of the risks that may affect our revenue and operations 
we conduct our corporate and store operations from leased facilities 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to ten years  and contain provisions for renewal options of five to ten years 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operation in recent years 
however  we cannot predict what effect inflation may have on our results of operation in the future 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of our profits are realized during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  which includes the december holiday season 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
our revolving line of credit bears interest at certain applicable margin levels contingent upon our leverage ratio on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate  which is either the index rate the higher of prime or basis points over the average of rates for overnight federal funds transactions plus a range from to or a rate equal to libor plus a range from to  increases as our leverage ratio increases 
adjustments to the applicable margin level are implemented quarterly on a prospective basis 
the interest cost of our bank debt is affected by changes in either prime  federal funds rates  or libor 
such changes could adversely impact our cost of borrowing 
the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility and can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries  including weather  political and economic conditions 
in addition  green coffee bean prices have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee beans through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide 
our hedging strategy is intended to limit the cost exposure of the main commodity used in our business  green coffee beans 
we use the following instruments to manage coffee supply and price risk 
fixed price purchase commitments  
coffee futures  and 
coffee futures options 
we use coffee futures and coffee futures options to reduce the price risk of our coffee purchase requirements that we cannot make or have not made on a contractual basis 
these coffee futures and coffee futures options are traded on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange 
we use these futures and options solely for financial hedging purposes and never take actual delivery of the coffee traded on the exchange 
fixed price purchase commitments we enter into fixed price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee beans and fix our cost of green coffee beans 
these commitments are made with established coffee brokers and are denominated in us dollars 
as of december   we had approximately million in open fixed priced purchase commitments with delivery dates ranging from january through november we believe  based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past  that the risk of non delivery on such purchase commitments is low 
coffee futures a coffee future is a contract to buy  pounds of green coffee beans at a contracted price and date 
the price of coffee traded on the exchange is known as the new york c market price 
we buy higher quality coffee that trades at premiums to the new york c market price 
although this premium varies depending on the supply and demand at the time of purchase  generally  the price of the coffee we purchase tends to fluctuate with the new york c market price 
this allows us to use coffee futures and coffee futures options to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use coffee futures to hedge the price of anticipated coffee purchases to achieve a target gross margin for roasted coffee 
we convert this margin requirement into an equivalent new york c market price for green coffee beans  which we call our threshold 
when the current new york c market price is below our threshold  we purchase coffee futures to fix the cost of our anticipated needs 
once we contract to purchase coffee from the supplier at a fixed price  we sell the related future 
if market prices decline  we forego potential additional gross margin and incur potential cash margin calls 
however  we are comfortable with this cost structure and enjoy the security of reduced risk 
coffee futures options when the current new york c market price is above our threshold  we purchase coffee futures options to limit the cost exposure for our anticipated needs 
a coffee futures option is an option to buy a coffee future at a specific price  known as a trade price 
the cost of the option is based on the relationship of the trade price to the current new york c market price 
when we commit to purchase a specified quantity of green coffee beans and do not fix a price  we will hedge this not yet priced purchase commitment by purchasing a coffee futures option 
this coffee futures option locks in a specific price for the not yet priced purchase commitment but does not obligate us to take delivery on the contract 
if market prices rise  we realize gains on the coffee futures option  which offset the increase in price we have to pay for the coffee beans 
if the market prices decline  we will set the contract price of the not yet priced purchase commitment at the market price and we will let the option expire  taking advantage of the declining market 
we also use coffee futures options to hedge anticipated coffee purchases 
when the current new york c market price is above our threshold  we purchase coffee futures options to limit the risk that coffee prices will continue to rise 
if market prices rise  the higher prices of our future fixed price coffee commitments will be offset by gains from the option 
if market prices decline  our future fixed price coffee commitments will be set at lower prices and the option will expire resulting in no further liability or obligation 
the extent of our coffee futures and coffee futures options positions at any given time depends on the amount of coffee we have contracted to purchase and general market conditions and trends 
we anticipate continuing this hedging strategy for the foreseeable future 
we held no coffee futures options as of december  and we did not enter into any coffee futures options during or our hedging positions are only placed by the chief financial officer through one brokerage firm that we believe to be reputable 
the following table reflects the outstanding coffee futures hedging positions as of december  and december  contract trade settlement number of contracts month price price gain loss may  unrealized gain loss as of december   mar  mar  may  may  unrealized gain loss as of december   these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are accounted for as inventory costs and are recorded as an expense or income when the related coffee is sold 
the ineffective portion is recorded as an expense or income immediately 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
specifies that goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be amortized but will instead be subject to periodic impairment testing 
we adopted sfas no 
on december  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provision of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of business 
sfas no 
became effective for us on december  adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors we may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or our business strategy may not be successful  either of which will impede our growth and operating results 
our business strategy emphasizes the expansion of our non retail distribution channels including specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  online and mail order  and office  restaurant and food service accounts 
this business strategy represents a shift from our historic business strategy  which largely emphasized opening and operating retail stores 
despite the change in our strategy  our retail stores  which generated nearly of our net revenue  continue to be an important element of our business 
we do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or whether our business strategy will be successful 
our ability to implement this business strategy is dependent on our ability to 
market our products on a national or international scale and over the internet  
enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers and other potential distributors of our coffee  
increase our brand recognition on a national and international scale  
identify and lease strategic locations suitable for new stores  and 
manage growth in administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our retail and non retail distribution channels 
our revenue may be adversely affected if we fail to implement our business strategy or if we divert resources to a business strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful 
because our business is centered on a single product  specialty coffee  if the demand for specialty coffee decreases  our business could suffer 
sales of specialty coffee constituted nearly of our net revenue 
demand for specialty coffee is affected by many factors  including 
consumer tastes and preferences  
national  regional and local economic conditions  and 
demographic trends 
because we are highly dependent on consumer demand for specialty coffee  a shift in consumer preferences away from specialty coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings 
if customer demand for specialty coffee decreases  our sales would decrease accordingly 
if we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand  our business could suffer 
we believe that maintaining and developing our brand is critical to our success and that the importance of brand recognition may increase as a result of competitors offering products similar to ours 
because the majority of our retail stores are located on the west coast  primarily in california  our brand recognition remains largely regional 
our brand building initiative involves increasing the availability of our products  increasing marketing expenditures and opening new stores in flagship locations to increase awareness of our brand and create and maintain brand loyalty 
if our brand building initiative is unsuccessful  we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy 
our success in promoting and enhancing the peet s brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products and customer service 
although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted whole bean coffee and our retail employees properly prepare our coffee beverages  we have no control over our whole bean coffee products once purchased by customers 
accordingly  customers may prepare coffee from our whole bean coffee inconsistent with our standards  store our whole bean coffee for long periods of time or resell our whole bean coffee without our consent  which  in each case  potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products 
if customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high quality  then the value of our brand may be diminished and  consequently  our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected 
we depend on the expertise of key personnel 
if these individuals leave or change their role within our company without effective replacements  our operations may suffer 
the success of our business is dependent to a large degree on our management  including christopher p 
mottern  chief executive officer and president 
if he were to leave peet s without an effective replacement  our revenue  operations  profits and growth may suffer 
as part of our management continuity plan  our board of directors is in the process of searching for an additional senior executive to take on the roles of chief executive officer and president  with mr 
mottern assuming a more strategic role as chairman of the board 
this search is focusing on individuals with extensive experience with consumer brands and the expertise necessary to continue the implementation of our multi channel distribution strategy 
we cannot guarantee that we will find a suitable candidate or that the person we hire will be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
if we hire someone who fails to successfully implement our business strategy  our revenue  operations  profits and growth may suffer 
see item directors and executive officers of the registrant management continuity plan 
in addition  we depend to a large degree on the expertise of our coffee roasters and purchasers 
our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer if we lost the services of any of these individuals 
our roasting methods are not proprietary  so competitors may be able to duplicate them  which could harm our competitive position 
we consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted whole bean coffee and  therefore  essential to our brand 
because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods  it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods 
if our competitors copy our roasting methods  the value of our brand may be diminished  and we may lose customers to our competitors 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods  which may also harm our competitive position 
because our business is based primarily in california  a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenue and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our california retail stores generated of our net revenue and a substantial portion of the revenue from our other distribution channels is generated in california 
we expect that our california operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  our california retail stores provide us with a means for increasing brand awareness  building customer loyalty and creating a premium specialty coffee brand 
as a result  an economic downturn or other decrease in consumer spending in california may not only lead to a substantial decrease in revenue  but may also adversely impact our ability to market our brand  build customer loyalty  or otherwise implement our business strategy 
if we are unable to continue leasing our retail locations or obtain leases for new stores  our existing operations and our ability to expand may be adversely affected 
all of our retail locations are on leased premises 
if we are unable to renew these leases  our revenue and profits could suffer 
in addition  we intend to lease other premises in connection with the planned expansion of our retail operations 
because we compete with other retailers and restaurants for store sites and some landlords may grant exclusive locations to our competitors  we may not be able to obtain new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms 
this could adversely impact our revenue growth and brand building initiatives 
we may not be able to hire or retain additional management and other personnel and our recruiting and training costs may increase as a result of turnover  both of which may increase our costs and reduce our profits and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified management and other personnel  including technical personnel and retail employees 
we face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
our ability to execute our business strategy may suffer if 
we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  
the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially  or 
the costs of outsourcing certain tasks to third party providers increase substantially 
in addition  we expend significant resources in training our retail managers and employees 
during the past few years  retail employee turnover has increased to approximately per year 
if turnover continues to increase  we may incur additional recruiting and training costs 
because we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis  any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our business 
we rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our customers and retail stores 
we consider roasted coffee a perishable product and we rely on these common carriers to deliver fresh roasted coffee on a daily basis 
we have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may be interrupted as a result of labor shortages  contract disputes or other factors 
if we experience an interruption in these services  we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner 
a delay in shipping could 
have an adverse impact on the quality of the coffee shipped  and thereby adversely affect our brand and reputation  
result in the disposal of an amount of coffee that could not be shipped in a timely manner  and 
require us to contract with alternative  and possibly more expensive  common carriers 
any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices  which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer 
because we have only one roasting facility  a significant interruption in the operation of this facility could potentially disrupt our operations 
we have only one coffee roasting and distribution facility 
a significant interruption in the operation of this facility  whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes  could significantly impair our ability to operate our business on a day to day basis 
moreover  our roasting and distribution facility and most of our stores are located near several major earthquake faults 
the impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict and an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business process 
our earthquake insurance does not cover revenue lost as a result of earthquakes 
increases in the cost of high quality arabica coffee beans could reduce our gross margin and profit 
coffee is a trade commodity and  in general  its price can fluctuate depending on 
weather patterns in coffee producing countries  
economic and political conditions affecting coffee producing countries  
foreign currency fluctuations  and 
the ability of coffee producing countries to agree to export quotas 
coffee prices are currently near historical lows and we believe they are likely to increase in the future 
if the cost of our green coffee beans increases due to any of these or other factors  we may not be able to pass along those costs to our customers because of the competitive nature of the specialty coffee industry 
if we are unable to pass along increased coffee costs  our margins will decrease and our profitability will suffer accordingly 
in addition  our hedging policy may not be effective in controlling our coffee costs and the brokers with whom we have fixed price coffee purchase commitments may not deliver under those commitments 
in either case  our coffee costs may increase and our profitability may suffer 
decreased availability of high quality arabica coffee beans could result in a decrease in revenue and jeopardize our ability to expand our business 
arabica coffee beans of the quality we purchase are not readily available on the commodity markets 
we depend on our relationships with coffee brokers  exporters and growers for the supply of our primary raw material  high quality arabica coffee beans 
in  we purchased over half of our green coffee beans through one broker 
if our relationships with coffee brokers  exporters and growers deteriorate  we may be unable to procure a sufficient quantity of high quality coffee beans 
in such case  we may not be able to fulfill the demand of our existing customers  supply new retail stores or expand other channels of distribution 
a raw material shortage could result in decreased revenue or could impair our ability to expand our business 
political instability in coffee growing regions could result in a decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee beans needed for the continued operation and growth of our business and an increase in our operating costs 
we roast arabica coffee beans from many different regions to produce types and blends of coffee 
the political situation in many of those regions  including africa  indonesia and central and south america  can be unstable  and such instability could affect our ability to purchase coffee from those regions 
if arabica coffee beans from a region become unavailable or prohibitively expensive  we may be forced to discontinue particular coffee types and blends or substitute coffee beans from other regions in our blends 
frequent substitutions and changes in our coffee product lines may lead to cost increases  customer alienation and fluctuations in our gross margins 
furthermore  a worldwide supply shortage of the high quality arabica coffee beans we purchase could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition in the specialty coffee market is intense and could affect our profitability 
the specialty coffee market is highly fragmented 
our primary competitors in whole bean specialty coffee sales include gevalia kraft foods  green mountain coffee  illy cafe  millstone procter gamble  seattle s best afc enterprises and starbucks 
there are numerous smaller  regional brands that also compete in this category 
in addition  we compete indirectly against all other coffee brands on the market 
a number of nationwide coffee marketers  such as kraft foods  procter gamble and nestle  are distributing premium coffee brands in supermarkets 
these premium coffee brands may serve as substitutes for our whole bean coffee 
in addition to competing with other distributors of whole bean coffee  we compete with retailers of prepared beverages  including coffee house chains  particularly starbucks  numerous convenience stores  restaurants  coffee shops and street vendors 
if we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors or our competitors adopt our strategies  then our competitive position will be weakened 
despite competing in a fragmented product category  whole bean specialty coffee brands are being established across multiple distribution channels 
several competitors are aggressive in obtaining distribution in specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  through online and mail order and in office  restaurant and food service locations 
we have only recently begun to penetrate these channels 
other competitors may have an advantage over us based on their earlier entry into these distribution channels 
competition in the specialty coffee market is becoming increasingly intense as relatively low barriers to entry encourage new competitors to enter the specialty coffee market 
many of these new market entrants may have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
in addition  many of our existing competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
adverse public or medical opinion about caffeine may harm our business 
our specialty coffee contains significant amounts of caffeine and other active compounds  the health effects of some of which are not fully understood 
a number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate  nausea and vomiting  restlessness and anxiety  depression  headaches  tremors  sleeplessness and other adverse health effects 
an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee  which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits 
adverse publicity regarding customer complaints may harm our business 
we may be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging beverage and food related illness  injuries suffered on the premises or other quality  health or operation concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect us  regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable
