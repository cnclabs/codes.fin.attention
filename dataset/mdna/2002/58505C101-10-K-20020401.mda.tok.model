to date  the company s consolidated revenues have come primarily from its lithotripsy business 
while it sells lithotripters and related supplies  most of its lithotripsy revenues come from recurring procedure and maintenance fees and other fee for service arrangements 
the company continues to expand its programs under which company owned lithotripters are made available for use by hospitals  physician groups and surgical centers with charges being based on usage of the equipment or monthly fees 
the company currently offers such lithotripsy services throughout the united states using sts systems in mobile trailers  one sts system at a fixed site and transportable sts t c systems which are at fixed locations or moved to different sites in small trucks 
in june  the company completed the acquisition of a interest in northern nevada  a lithotripsy partnership which deals directly with patient and insurers  and also founded upr as a majority owned subsidiary of the company  to expand the company s service orientation to the urologist practitioner

over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill was amortized over periods ranging from to years  the expected period of benefit  using the straight line method 
as of january   the company will adopt sfas and no longer amortize goodwill on a periodic basis 
the company will review the recoverable life of these intangible assets annually to determine any impairment of the assets and write them down to their net realizable value when necessary 
the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
based upon the company s analysis  which includes a comparison of the carrying amounts of such assets to the company s historical actual cash flows and estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the company is not aware of any material portion of goodwill or other long lived assets which will dissipate over a shorter period than the amortization period used

the company constantly re evaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the necessary estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  customer receivables  inventories  equity investments  fixed asset lives  contingencies and litigation 
the company has also chosen certain accounting policies when options were available  including 
the first in  first out fifo method to value a majority of our inventories  and 
the intrinsic value method  or apb opinion no

if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented
