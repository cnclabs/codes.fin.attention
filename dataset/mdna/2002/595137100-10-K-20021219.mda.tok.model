and its wholly owned subsidiary  of lawrence  massachusetts nes 
on august   microsemi cdi  inc mcdi  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired the assets of compensated devices  inc  of melrose  massachusetts cdi 
results of operations and cash flows of mnes and mcdi from the dates of acquisitions were included in the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company started the restructuring consolidations of microsemi watertown inc  of watertown  massachusetts watertown and mcdi into other operations of the company 
in june  the company completed the sale of the assets  including the real property  of microsemi rf products  inc rf  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  based in montgomeryville  pennsylvania to a subsidiary of advanced power technology inc  of bend  oregon 
in september  the company sold the assets of the carlsbad design center to ami semiconductor  inc  of pocatello  idaho 
in october  the company completed the sale of semcon electronic private limited semcon 
the loss incurred in the sale of semcon has been accrued in the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  the company believes that its capacity optimization and profit enhancement program as of september   could result in future annual cost savings of as much as million from the elimination of redundant facilities and associated staff 
the estimated amount of savings excludes the associated restructuring charges 
the objectives of this program are to increase company wide capacity utilization and operating efficiencies through consolidations and realignments of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires microsemi to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions related to allowances related to revenue recognition  allowances for sale returns  doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset valuations and accounting for income taxes 
estimates and assumptions are based upon historical experience as well as various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates and actual results  the future financial position and results of operations and cash flow of microsemi will be affected 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
however  microsemi records reductions to revenue for estimated allowances such as returns  rebate and competitive pricing programs 
if actual returns  rebate and or pricing adjustments exceed estimates  additional reductions to revenue would result 
allowance for doubtful accounts management analyzes specific customer accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debt expenses  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers were to deteriorate to the point of impairing the customer s ability to make payments on its account  additional allowances would be required 
while credit losses have been generally within management s expectations and the provisions established  significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial position of any of the company s major customers or any group of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets 
the company also evaluates the composition of its inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete product 
these evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of the company s products  and current market and economic conditions 
inventory reserves are established  based on such judgments  for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than its cost 
historically  the net realizable value of the company s inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if the company is not able to meet its sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate significantly from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of the company s inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
long lived assets the excess of the purchase price of businesses or assets acquired over the fair value of the net assets goodwill is amortized over years 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the recoverability of long lived assets and certain intangible assets  including goodwill 
in the event the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives of certain assets and liabilities acquired are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
microsemi used an independent valuation firm to assist in evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets 
various methods were used for the estimation of the value of intangibles acquired 
these methods rely on a number of estimates and assumptions  including projected future cash flows  residual growth rates and discount factors 
most of these assumptions were made based on available historical information and industry averages 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired can also significantly affect net income 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  microsemi will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas  which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach  consequently goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized 
the estimates and assumptions described above  as well as the determination as to how goodwill will be allocated to different operating segments  will affect the impairment  if any  to be recognized upon adoption of sfas in addition  if microsemi had identified more intangible assets with definite lives  less goodwill would have been recorded in its acquisitions and future reported results would have been lower 
the value of intangible assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if microsemi experiences declines in operating results or negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below projections 
microsemi periodically reviews its intangible assets and goodwill for impairment 
the estimates that are used in the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that management uses to manage microsemi s business 
if new products fail to gain market acceptance or if market projections are too high  revenue and cost forecasts will not be achieved  impairment charges to goodwill may be recorded 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  microsemi has to estimate its income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
if the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it will adversely effect the tax provision in the statement of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in exchange rates and prices 
the company conducts business in a number of foreign currencies  principally those of europe and asia  directly or in its foreign operations 
the company may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory in foreign currencies 
accordingly  microsemi is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of the company s business 
also these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on microsemi s revenues or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that those currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on the results of operations  cash flows and financial condition of the company 
the largest foreign currency exposure of the company results from activity in british pounds and the european union euro 
the company has not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
the company has and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
the company did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading  speculative purposes or to manage its interest rate risk 
the company s other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  the company does not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
the company does not engage in transactions intended to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates
