the increase in net revenues in from of billion  or  was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices asp s 
the significant change in units and asp s in from is primarily due to expansion of the company s hard drive product line into lower end desktop pc and consumer electronics markets 
consolidated net revenues in were flat with  at approximately billion 
excluding million of revenue in related to the company s discontinued small computer system interface scsi product line  revenue increased million or in this improvement was due to an increase in eide drive unit shipments of approximately  partially offset by a decline in asp s 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of revenue in  million  or of revenue in  and million  or of revenue  in gross profit for included million of special charges  of which million related to costs associated with exiting the scsi hard drive product line  and million related to costs to repair recalled drives 
excluding special charges  gross profit was million  or of revenue  for the increase in gross profit in from was primarily the result of more cost effective designs and higher unit volume  partially offset by lower asp s 
the increase in gross profit in from excluding the special charges was primarily the result of higher volume and lower manufacturing costs due to expense reduction efforts  partially offset by lower asp s 
operating expenses research and development r d expense was  and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in r d expense in from of million was due to increases in new development programs and higher employee incentive payments  partially offset by expense reduction 
table of contents efforts 
the decrease in from of million was primarily due to the company s exit from the scsi hard drive market during and expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was  and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a expense in from of million was primarily due to expense reduction efforts  partially offset by higher employee incentive payments 
the decrease in from of million was primarily due to the company s exit from the scsi hard drive market in and expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations 
restructuring charges during  the company initiated restructuring actions to improve operational efficiency and reduce operating expenses 
these actions primarily consisted of a consolidation of the company s asian operations and termination of its scsi hard drive product line 
restructuring charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled million and consisted of severance and outplacement costs  the retirement of manufacturing equipment and information systems assets  and net lease cancellation costs 
also recorded in connection with these actions were special charges to cost of revenues of million for vendor settlements  incremental warranty  and inventory write downs associated with exiting the scsi hard drive product line 
interest and other income expense net interest and other income expense was  and million in  and  respectively 
this includes net investment gains of million in  investment write offs and related lease contingency accruals of million in  and net investment gains of million in excluding these nonrecurring items  net interest and other expense was  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net expense in excluding nonrecurring items was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates 
the decrease in net expense in excluding nonrecurring items was primarily due to lower interest expense on lower average debt balances resulting from the payment in of an outstanding term loan of million and redemptions during and of the company s zero coupon convertible debentures 
included in s net investment gains is a million recovery from the sale of the company s remaining komag investments to a third party 
these investments were part of the million nonoperating charge recorded to net interest and other expense during to adjust the carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable from komag and accruals of komag contingent guarantees  resulting from komag s announcement to file for chapter reorganization 
income tax benefit the company s net income tax benefit of million included a federal income tax refund of million for a loss carryback available as a result of tax legislation enacted during the year 
during  the company did not record an income tax benefit  as no loss carrybacks were available at that time 
during  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million to adjust its current and deferred tax accruals 
the accruals were established in prior years primarily for the unremitted income of foreign subsidiaries 
however  due to the significant increase of net operating loss carryforwards and reevaluation of the accruals after the substantial international restructurings in  the company believed the accruals were no longer necessary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations during  the company discontinued the operations of new business ventures  including connex  inc connex  sanavigator  inc 
sanavigator and keen personal media  inc keen 
the company sold substantially all of the assets of its connex and sanavigator businesses for a net gain of million and terminated the keen operations 
these operating losses for the periods reported and the net gain recognized on the sale of connex and sanavigator have been segregated from continuing operations and reported separately on the statements of operations as discontinued operations 

table of contents extraordinary item during  the company issued million shares of common stock and paid million in cash in exchange for million in face value of its convertible debentures with a book value of million 
during  the company issued million shares of common stock in exchange for million in face value of its convertible debentures with a book value of million 
during  the company issued million shares of common stock in exchange for million in face value of its convertible debentures with a book value of million 
these redemptions were private  individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors 
as a result of the redemptions  the company recognized an extraordinary loss of million in and extraordinary gains of and million in and  respectively see also new accounting pronouncements 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at june  and million at june  net cash provided by continuing operations was million during as compared to net cash used for continuing operations of million during this million improvement in cash provided by continuing operations consists of a million improvement in the company s net income  net of non cash items  and a million decrease in cash used to fund working capital requirements 
these improvements are due to significantly better operating performance by the company  including higher sales volume  improved cost management  and a lower cash conversion cycle 
the company s cash conversion cycle  which represents the sum of the number of days sales outstanding dso and days inventory outstanding dio less days payable outstanding dpo  was negative days for  a day improvement over the prior year 
accounts receivable at june  was higher than the prior year as a result of higher fourth quarter revenue combined with longer average collection days due to the elimination of certain early payment discount programs 
however  this increase in average collection days was offset by improved inventory turns and longer payment days with suppliers 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased to million at june  from million at june  as a result of the write off of fully reserved accounts receivable balances which management determined to be uncollectable 
other uses of cash during included net capital expenditures of million  primarily for normal replacement of existing assets and the purchase of assets for the company s new manufacturing facility in thailand  and million for debenture redemptions 
other sources of cash during included million received from the sale of assets  million received in connection with stock option and warrant exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases  and million received by the company s subsidiary from minority investors 
other uses of cash during included net capital expenditures of million  primarily to upgrade the company s hard drive production capabilities and for normal replacement of existing assets 
other sources of cash during included proceeds of million received upon the sale of marketable equity securities  million received upon issuance of million shares of the company stock under the company s equity facility and million received in connection with the stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in will not be more than million and will relate to normal replacement of existing assets and expansion of the company s new thailand facility 
discontinued operations provided net cash proceeds of million in  including approximately million net proceeds from asset sales 
this compares to million in net cash used to fund the operating  investing and financing activities of the discontinued operations for the company has zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february  the debentures 
the debentures are subordinated to all senior debt  are redeemable at the option of the company any time after february  at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption  and at the holder s option  will be redeemed by the company  as of february   
table of contents february  or february   or if there is a fundamental change as defined in the debenture documents  at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption 
the payment on those dates  with the exception of a fundamental change  can be in cash  stock or any combination  at the company s option 
the debentures are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at the rate of shares per  principal amount at maturity 
since issuance of the debentures in  the company has redeemed debentures with a book value of million and an aggregate principal amount at maturity of billion through the issuance of cash and or common stock 
these redemptions were private  individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional investors 
as of june   the remaining book value of the debentures was million  the aggregate principal amount at maturity was million and the market value was million 
based on current forecasts that show the company continuing to generate positive cash flow from operations  the company now intends to satisfy the majority  if not all  of its put obligations in cash instead of common stock 
accordingly  the debentures have been classified as a current liability at june  debentures not put to the company in february  if any  will be reclassified as long term debt 
during  the company entered into a three year senior credit facility  replacing a previous facility that had matured on march  the senior credit facility provides up to million in revolving credit subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation  matures on september  and is secured by accounts receivable  inventory  of the stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets 
at the option of the company  borrowings bear interest at either libor with option periods of one to three months or a base rate  plus a margin determined by the borrowing base 
the senior credit facility requires the company to maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth  prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number of other covenants 
as of the date hereof  there were no borrowings under the facility 
however  the company has issued a million standby letter of credit under the facility to cirrus logic  inc cirrus concerning million in disputed accounts payable 
these disputed accounts payable have been recorded in the company s financial statements  but are part of the company s litigation against cirrus see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the availability under the senior credit facility has been reduced by a corresponding amount of the outstanding letter of credit 
during and  respectively  the company issued and million shares of common stock under preexisting shelf registrations for net cash proceeds of and million 
during  no common stock was issued under these shelf registrations and the company withdrew them as management determined they would not be utilized in the foreseeable future 
at june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million net of the debentures and shareholders equity of million 
in addition  the company has a senior credit facility providing up to million in revolving credit subject to outstanding letters of credit and a borrowing base calculation 
the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents and its existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs through the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that the senior credit facility will continue to be available to the company 
also  the company s ability to sustain its working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below under the headings risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate and risk factors relating to western digital particularly 
commitments the following is a summary of the company s significant contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at june  convertible debentures the company has zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due february  the debentures 
for a description of the debentures  see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents operating leases the company leases certain facilities and equipment under long term  non cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through the following table summarizes the future payments of these leases in thousands operating leases thereafter total future minimum lease obligations purchase orders in the normal course of business  to reduce the risk of component shortages  the company enters into purchase commitments with suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to manufacture the company s products 
these commitments generally cover forecasted component supplies needed for production during the next quarter  become payable upon receipt of the components and may be non cancelable cancellation charges may be significant 
the company s relationship with suppliers allows for some flexibility within these commitments and quantities are subject to change as a quarter progresses and the company s needs change 
forward exchange contracts although the majority of the company s transactions are in us dollars  some transactions are based in various foreign currencies 
the company purchases short term  forward exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets  liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
the company does not purchase short term forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
as of june   the company had million outstanding of purchased foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed three months 
at june   the carrying value of the contracts approximates fair value 
critical accounting policies the preceding discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the company has adopted accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates 
following are the company s most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve management s judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue and accounts receivable in accordance with standard industry practice  the company has agreements with resellers that provide price protection for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list price reductions 
in addition the company may have agreements with resellers that provide for stock rotation on slow moving items and other incentive programs 
in accordance with current accounting standards  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery to resellers and records a corresponding adjustment for estimated price protection and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their customers 
adjustments are based on 
table of contents anticipated price decreases  estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers  estimated future returns  as well as historical pricing information 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  the company routinely analyzes the different receivable aging categories and establishes reserves based on the length of time receivables are past due 
the company records provisions against revenue and cost of revenues for estimated sales returns in the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
the company bases these provisions on existing product return notifications as well as historical returns by product type see warranty 
warranty the company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue is recognized 
warranty covers cost of repair or replacement of the hard drive  and the warranty periods range from one to three years 
the company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate accruals for warranty  which include specific detail on hard drives in the field by product type  historical field return rates and costs to repair 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
inventory write downs are recorded for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions  estimates of future sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
the company evaluates inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
the company writes down inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory based on the analysis 
litigation and other contingencies the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies 
accordingly  the company accrues loss contingencies when management  in consultation with its legal advisors  concludes that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
deferred tax assets the company s deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  are fully reserved due to management s determination that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
this determination is based on the weight of available evidence  the most significant of which is the company s loss history in the related tax jurisdictions 
should this determination change in the future  some amount of deferred tax assets could be recognized  resulting in a tax benefit or a reduction of future tax expense 
new accounting pronouncements during april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas rescinds sfas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item 
the company will adopt sfas on june  at which time it will begin classifying gains and losses resulting from the extinguishment of debt as other income and expense  instead of extraordinary items 
the adoption will not have a net impact on the company s results of operations or liquidity 
on september   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining whether certain conversions of convertible debt to equity securities are within 
table of contents the scope of fasb statement no 
 induced conversions of convertible debt fas 
the eitf deliberated this issue because of diversity in practice in the accounting for conversions of convertible debt to equity initiated by the debt holder 
in practice  some registrants accounted for these transactions following fas while others followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 early extinguishment of debt apb 
the eitf concluded that fas applies to conversions of convertible debt when the offer for consideration in excess of the original conversion terms was made by the bondholder 
the eitf concluded that this guidance should be followed for transactions entered into on or after september  the company s previous extinguishments of its convertible debentures involving the issuance of stock have been accounted for under apb whereby a gain on early extinguishment was recorded equal to the excess of the net book value of the indebtedness over the fair value of the consideration paid to extinguish the indebtedness 
following the guidance in eitf issue no 
 similar early extinguishments of the convertible debentures involving stock initiated by the debt holder will give rise to a conversion inducement expense equal to the fair value of the shares issued in excess of those required to be issued upon the exercise of the debenture conversion feature 
the company does not expect eitf issue no 
to have a significant impact on the future results of operations because the company does not expect to use stock to make early extinguishments of its convertible debentures 
risk factors related to the hard drive industry in which we operate our operating results depend on our being among the first to market and first to volume with our new products at a low cost 
to achieve consistent success with computer manufacturer customers  we must be an early provider of next generation hard drives featuring leading technology and high quality 
if we fail to consistently maintain or improve our time to market performance with our new products  produce these products in sufficient volume within our rapid product cycle  qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by meeting our customers performance and quality specifications  achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and costs with these products  or consistently meet stated quality requirements on delivered products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
product life cycles require continuous technical innovation associated with higher areal densities 
new products require higher areal densities the gigabyte of storage per disk than previous product generations  posing formidable technical challenges 
higher areal densities require fewer heads and disks to achieve a given drive capacity  which means that existing head technology must be improved to accommodate more data on a single disk 
our failure to bring these new products to market on time and at acceptable costs would put us at a competitive disadvantage to companies that achieve these results 
short product life cycles make it difficult to recover the cost of development 
over the past few years  hard drive areal density has increased at a much more rapid pace than previously experienced 
this has significantly shortened product life cycles since each generation of drives is more cost effective than the previous one 
shorter product life cycles make it more difficult to recover the cost of product development 
short product life cycles and new products force us to continually qualify new products with our customers 
due to short product life cycles and continuously changing products  we must regularly engage in new product qualification with our customers 
to be considered for qualification we must be among the leaders in time to market with our new products 
once a product is accepted for qualification testing  any failure or 
table of contents delay in the qualification process can result in our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of products is introduced 
the effect of missing a product qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume computer manufacturers  most of which continue to consolidate their share of the pc market 
these risks are increased because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result in declining sales and gross margins on our current generation products 
unexpected technology advances in the hard drive industry could harm our competitive position 
if one of our competitors were able to implement a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that enables a step change increase in areal density that permits greater storage of data on a disk  it could harm our operating results 
advances in magnetic  optical  semiconductor or other data storage technologies could result in competitive products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our products 
if these products prove to be superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity  we could be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those products 
our average selling prices are declining 
we expect that our average selling prices for hard drives will continue to decline 
increases in areal density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks  and therefore lower component cost 
because of the competitiveness of the hard drive industry  lower costs generally mean lower prices 
this is true even for those products that are competitive and introduced into the market in a timely manner 
our average selling prices decline even further when competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity  liquidate excess inventories  restructure or attempt to gain market share 
the hard drive industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the major competitors 
the price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases in supply  cost reductions  technological advances and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess inventories or attempting to gain market share 
in addition  rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
these factors  taken together  result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s major participants 
for example  during the first quarter of  the company lost market share as a result of a product recall 
similar losses in market share could adversely affect our operating results 
our prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable end user demand and oversupply of hard drives 
demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to existing systems 
the demand for systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given period 
as a result  the hard drive market tends to experience periods of excess capacity  which typically lead to intense price competition 
during calendar year and the first half of calendar year  the industry experienced weak pc demand in the us and other markets 
if intense price competition occurs as a result of weak demand  we may be forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected  which could result in lower revenues and gross profits 
changes in the markets for hard drives require us to develop new products 
over the past few years the consumer market for desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced systems  especially those systems priced below  although we were late to market with a value line hard drive to serve the low cost pc market  we are now offering such value line products at prices that we view as competitive 
however  if we are not able to continue to offer a competitively priced value line hard drive for the low cost pc market  our share of that market will likely fall  which could harm our operating results 

table of contents the pc market is fragmenting into a variety of computing devices and products 
some of these products  such as internet appliances  may not contain a hard drive 
on the other hand  many industry analysts expect  as do we  that as broadcasting and communications are increasingly converted to digital technology from the older  analog technology  the technology of computers and consumer electronics and communication devices will converge  and hard drives will be found in many consumer products other than computers 
for  more than of our unit sales were for consumer products other than computers  primarily gaming devices 
if we are not successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise to develop new products for these emerging markets  it will likely harm our operating results 
the market acceptance for hard disk drives in game consoles continues to be uncertain 
the use of hard disk drives in the game console market is a fairly recent trend 
due to the price competitive nature of the hard disk drive industry  with selling prices of personal computers being substantially higher than game consoles  game manufacturers may not have the ability to either incorporate or continue to incorporate hard disk drives into their overall architecture 
in addition  current price reduction demands from either current or future game console customers may not make hard disk drive integration an attractive market for us or other hard drive manufacturers 
we depend on our key personnel and skilled employees 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key personnel and skilled employees  many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace 
worldwide competition for skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense 
we have lost a number of experienced hard drive engineers over the past two years as a result of the loss of retention value of their employee stock options because of the decrease in price of our common stock and aggressive recruiting of our employees 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or skilled employees or hire and integrate new key personnel or skilled employees  our operating results would likely be harmed 
risk factors relating to western digital particularly loss of market share with a key customer could harm our operating results 
a majority of our revenue comes from a few customers 
for example  during  sales to our top customers accounted for approximately of revenue 
these customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us 
even if we successfully qualify a product with a customer  the customer generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with us at any time 
our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance 
if we lose a key customer  or if any of our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs  our operating results would likely be harmed 
for example  this occurred with our enterprise hard drive product line early in the third quarter of and is one of the factors which led to our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market 
dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components could lead to delays  lost revenue or increased costs 
because we do not manufacture any of the basic components in our hard drives  an extended shortage of required components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in business  adjust to market conditions  or to meet our quality  yield or production requirements could harm us more severely than our competitors  some of whom manufacture certain of the components for their hard drives  and could significantly harm our operating results 
a number of the components used by us are available from only a single or limited number of qualified outside suppliers 
if a component is in short supply  or a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a component  we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component 
in addition  if a component becomes unavailable  we could suffer significant loss of revenue 
for example  we lost revenue in 
table of contents september when we had to shut down our caviar product line production for approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver chip that was sole sourced from a third party supplier 
to reduce the risk of component shortages  we attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these components 
as a result  we may have to pay significant cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders  as we did in when we accelerated our transition to magnetoresistive recording head technology  and as we did in as a result of our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market 
in april  we entered into a three year volume purchase agreement with komag under which we buy a substantial portion of our media components from komag 
in october  we amended the komag volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term to six years 
similarly  in february  we entered into a two year volume purchase agreement with ibm under which we buy a substantial portion of our read channel chips from ibm 
effective june  we amended the ibm volume purchase agreement to extend the initial term through december  these strategic relationships have increased our dependence on each of komag and ibm as a supplier 
our future operating results may depend substantially on komag s ability to timely qualify its media components in our new development programs  and each of komag s and ibm s ability to supply us with these components or chips  as the case may be  in sufficient volume to meet our production requirements 
a significant disruption in komag s ability to manufacture and supply us with media components or ibm s ability to manufacture and supply us with read channel chips could harm our operating results 
to develop new products we must maintain effective partner relationships with our strategic component suppliers 
under our business model  we do not manufacture any of the component parts used in our hard drives 
as a result  the success of our products depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts that are best in class from reliable component suppliers 
to do so we must effectively manage our relationships with our strategic component suppliers 
we must also effectively integrate different products from a variety of suppliers  each of which employs variations on technology which can impact  for example  feasible combinations of heads and media components 
we are currently engaged in litigation with cirrus  which until this year was the sole source of read channel chips for our hard drives 
as a result of the disputes that gave rise to the litigation  our business operations were at risk until another supplier s read channel chips could be designed into our products 
similar disputes with other strategic component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results 
we have only one primary high volume manufacturing facility  and a secondary smaller facility  which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of either facility 
the majority of our manufacturing volume comes from one facility in malaysia 
during  we acquired a second  smaller manufacturing facility in thailand 
a fire  flood  earthquake or other disaster  condition or event that adversely affects either our malaysia or thailand facility or ability to manufacture could result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating results 
terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business and operating results 
the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   the united states led military response to counter terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and insurance markets and have significantly increased the political  economic and social instability in some of the geographic areas in which the company operates 
it is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the united states domestically or abroad and such acts of terrorism could be directed against properties and personnel of us owned companies such as ours 

table of contents manufacturing our products abroad subjects us to numerous risks 
we are subject to risks associated with our foreign manufacturing operations  including obtaining requisite united states and foreign governmental permits and approvals  currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions  political instability and civil unrest  transportation delays or higher freight rates  labor problems  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  exchange  currency and tax controls and reallocations  increasing labor and overhead costs  and loss or non renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements or treaties with foreign tax authorities 
we have attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes by  among other things  entering into short term  forward exchange contracts 
however  those contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency controls are put in place  which occurred in malaysia during the first quarter of as a result of the malaysian currency controls  we are no longer hedging the malaysian currency risk 
currently  we hedge the thai baht and british pound sterling 
the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of significant litigation 
the hard drive industry has been characterized by significant litigation 
this includes litigation relating to patent and other intellectual property rights  product liability claims and other types of litigation 
we are currently evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of patents from patent holders 
we also are a party to several judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we conclude that a claim of infringement is valid  we may be required to obtain a license or cross license  modify our existing technology or design a new non infringing technology 
such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly 
we may also be liable for any past infringement 
if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit  an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product 
it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or  if there is a finding of willful infringement  treble damages 
any of these results would likely increase our costs and harm our operating results 
our reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients of our business could be copied by competitors 
our success depends  in significant part  on the proprietary nature of our technology  including non patentable intellectual property such as our process technology 
despite safeguards  to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise capitalize on our technology  it may be difficult  expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states
