results of operations net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the company s primary source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the level of rates paid on those liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information relating to bnc s average balance sheet and reflects the yield on average assets and costs of average liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities

a reflecting strategic shift in earning asset mix from investment securities to loans arising from lending opportunities in the minnesota  north dakota and arizona markets 
b loan growth is attributable to increases in loans originated in the minnesota  north dakota and arizona markets 
c the decreased loan yield is reflective of a bp decrease in the prime rate over the course of as monetary policy eased in response to weakening national economic conditions 
d the decreased investment yield reflects the lower rate environment in as well as the reduction in the size of investment portfolio in order to shift the earning asset mix toward loans 
e the decrease in investment securities noted in a along with the increase in average loans noted in b caused this change in the mix of the earning asset portfolio 
f deposit growth is primarily attributable to the continued success of the wealthbuilder family of now and money market accounts in addition to increased use of direct non brokered national certificates of deposit obtained via posting rates on national networks 
national certificates of deposit were million as of december  compared to million on december  g decreased fhlb borrowings due to greater use of national certificates of deposit as a wholesale funding source in order to maintain borrowing capacity at the fhlb  support the earning asset base  and take advantage of favorable costs of national certificates of deposits relative to fhlb borrowings 
in addition  the company redeemed the remaining million of its percent subordinated notes due may  through the exercise of its call option 
h decreased cost of interest bearing deposits is reflective of the rise in volume of wealthbuilder now and money market accounts and the associated decreases in cost as interest rates declined during the wealthbuilder accounts carry rates that are variable at management s discretion 
management lowered the rates paid for these deposits in response the monetary easing that took place during while maintaining the competitive nature of the wealthbuilder products in the company s various markets 
additionally  in a lower rate environment  the cost of certificates of deposit also decreases with renewals and new accounts 
i rates are reflective of the overall decreased rate environment in as compared to net interest income and margin in future periods are expected to be impacted by several factors 
recent decreases in the prime rate will negatively impact interest income and yields on loans but will positively impact interest expense and the cost of deposits and borrowings 
many factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive environment in the markets in which the company operates  the multitude of financial and investment products available to the public and the monetary policies of the frb  can materially impact the company s operating results 
therefore  management cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  prospects for net interest income in future periods

b loan growth is attributable to increases in loans originated in both the minnesota and north dakota markets 
c the improved loan yield is reflective of prime rate increases in offset by some decreases in loan pricing spread to prime rate due to competitive pressures in all markets 
d the improved investment yield reflects the higher rate environment in as well as the mix of investment types in the company s investment portfolio 
e the increase in investment securities noted in a caused this change in the mix of the earning asset portfolio 
while such a mix change has a negative effect on yield on earning assets because investments typically yield less than loans  the strategy is accretive to earnings 
f deposit growth is primarily attributable to the continued success of the wealthbuilder family of now and money market accounts 
g increased fhlb borrowings for the purpose of purchasing investment securities 
see a above 
h increased cost of interest bearing deposits is reflective of the volume of wealthbuilder now and money market accounts and the associated increases in cost as interest rates rose during during and  the wealthbuilder accounts were indexed to and floated with the day t bill rate 
additionally  in a higher rate environment  the cost of certificates of deposit also increases with renewals and new accounts 
i rates are reflective of the overall increased rate environment in as compared to provision for credit losses 
management determines a provision for credit losses which it considers sufficient to maintain the company s allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item and financial condition loan portfolio allowance for credit losses for further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in and million in noninterest income

management cannot predict with any degree of certainty the amount of loans which will be originated or placed and related loan fees which will be recognized in future periods 
b in  insurance commissions remained relatively stable in spite of a reduction in the number of insurance agents 
in  insurance commissions experienced a decline in the face of a challenging economic environment 
c increase for is attributable to the addition of brokerage staff at bnc ami and successful efforts to cross sell brokerage services to bank customers 
in  brokerage income was relatively stable in the face of a challenging economic environment and a prolonged period of soft conditions in equity markets

in addition  given the significant decline in interest rates during  sales of investment securities were necessary in order to adjust the forward looking risk reward profile of the investment portfolio 
e the increase is attributable to fees associated with the bnc us opportunities fund  llc which was formed on september  and is managed by the bnc minnesota s financial services division 
in  the fees from the bnc us opportunities fund  llc decreased as the fees are a function of the asset size of the fund 
the fund s asset size was negatively impacted by the overall decline in equity markets 
f service charges increased in and as the company continued to increase its wealthbuilder now and money market volume along with an increase in non interest bearing deposits which are primarily business deposit relationships that tend to utilize a greater level of fee based deposit services

in  the company began to strategically shift the larger earning asset base to loans from investment securities 
b in  the company increased its net loans and leases by strategically shifting its earning asset mix toward loans from investment securities 
the increase in net loans and leases reflected commercial real estate and real estate construction loans arising from opportunities primarily in the arizona and minnesota markets 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in real estate construction loans 
although net loans outstanding did not increase materially  gross loans originated by the company increased significantly in as the company originated and sold portions of loans to other lenders on a nonrecourse basis

b increases in the savings  now and money market category are attributable to the popularity of the company s wealthbuilder deposit products 
success of these products has also contributed to a decrease in the other time deposits category as some customers have elected to transfer maturing time deposits to the more liquid and competitively priced wealthbuilder products 
during  the other time deposits category increased due to certain special promotions in select markets 
c brokered deposits totaled million at december  compared to and million at december  and  respectively 
national certificates of deposit increased to million at december  compared to million at december  due to greater use of national certificates of deposit as a wholesale funding source in order to maintain borrowing capacity at the fhlb and take advantage of favorable costs of national certificates of deposits relative to fhlb borrowings 
d increases in short term borrowings for are attributable to the balance sheet leveraging strategy

investment securities 
bnc s investment policy is designed to enhance net income and return on equity through prudent management of risk  ensure liquidity for cash flow requirements  help manage interest rate risk  ensure collateral is available for public deposits  advances and repurchase agreements and manage asset diversification 
in managing the portfolio  the company seeks a balance among yield and the management of credit and liquidity risks with a goal of maximizing the longer term overall profitability of the company 
investments are centrally managed in order to maximize compliance federal laws and regulations place certain restrictions on the amounts and types of investments bnc may hold and effectiveness of overall investing activities 
the primary goal of bnc s investment policy is to contribute to the overall profitability of the company 
the objective is to purchase and own securities and combinations of securities with good risk reward characteristics 
good risk reward securities are those identified through thorough analysis of the cash flows and potential cash flows as well as market value and potential future market value of the security in question given various interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies are developed in light of constant view of the company s overall asset liability position 
as it relates to investment strategies  the focus of the asset liability management committee is to determine the impact of interest rate changes on both future income and market value of securities in the portfolio

as part of the strategic shift in the earning asset mix from investment securities to loans  the company decreased its holdings in collateralized mortgage obligations  corporate bonds  and state and municipal bonds by  and million respectively 
equity securities decreased by million as the company was required to hold less stock in the federal home loan bank of des moines as a result of a decrease in its fhlb borrowings 
in addition  as a result of bp of monetary easing over the course of  the yield curve experienced a significant downward shift and increase in slope relative to the ongoing portfolio management process and individual security risk reward analysis described above led to the sale of individual securities whose forward looking risk reward profile given various interest rate scenarios was inferior to other securities available for purchase 
the need to optimize the risk reward profile of the portfolio as a whole in addition to the reduction in the portfolio size as more earning assets were shifted to loans resulted in transactions that generated net realized securities gains of million 
during  the company had increased its holdings in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  us government agency mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds by  and million  respectively as part of the company s strategy to increase its earning asset portfolio by purchasing investment securities primarily funded through fhlb borrowings 
the portfolio management process  investment objectives  and risk reward analysis described above led the increase in the investment portfolio to be over weighted toward cmos due to their risk reward characteristics 
in addition  over the course of  principal cash flows were primarily reinvested in cmos because they offered a better risk reward profile due to the structure of the cmo cash flows relative to mortgage backed securities 
at december   bnc held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities and agency mortgage backed securities and cmos  that exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity 
a significant portion of the company s investment securities portfolio approximately percent at december  was pledged as collateral for public deposits and borrowings  including borrowings with the fhlb

nonperforming loans and assets 
bnc s lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the quality of the loan portfolio 
officer compensation depends  to a substantial extent  on maintaining loan quality and dealing with credit issues in a timely and proactive manner 
lenders are not compensated for growth at the expense of credit quality 
loan officers are responsible for regular reviews of past due loans in their respective portfolios 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly and examined by the company s loan review personnel 
loans demonstrating weaknesses are downgraded in a timely fashion and the board receives a listing of all such loans on a monthly basis

loans in this category must be well secured and in the process of collection 
these loans are monitored closely by bnc lending and management personnel 
nonaccrual loans include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
accrual of interest is discontinued when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to the current reporting period is reversed against interest income of the current period 
accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to previous reporting periods is charged against the allowance for credit losses 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
as noted above  of the million of loans in this category at december   million relates to two commercial customers and loans for one of these customers are partially sba guaranteed 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including a reduction of the interest rate or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of its original principal will occur 
other real estate owned and repossessed assets represents properties and other assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure 
such properties and assets are included in other assets in the balance sheets 
they are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition establishing a new cost basis 
write downs to fair value at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the real estate or assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
write downs  revenues and expenses incurred subsequent to foreclosure are charged to operations as recognized incurred 
potential problem loans 
in accordance with accounting standards  the company identifies loans considered impaired and the valuation allowance attributable to these loans 
impaired loans generally include loans on which management believes  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and which are analyzed for a specific reserve allowance 
bnc generally considers all loans risk graded substandard and doubtful as well as nonaccrual and restructured loans as impaired 
impaired loans at december   not including the past due  nonaccrual and restructured loans reported above  totaled million 
a significant portion of these loans are not in default but may have characteristics such as recent adverse operating cash flows or general risk characteristics that the loan officer feels might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the ultimate resolution of these credits is subject to changes in economic conditions and other factors 
these loans are closely monitored to ensure that the company s position as creditor is protected to the fullest extent possible 
allowance for credit losses 
the company maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the loan and lease portfolio and other credit exposures are reviewed regularly to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  the company evaluates the allowance necessary for specific nonperforming loans and also estimates losses in other credit exposures 
the resultant three allowance components are as follows specific reserve 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of problem loans over a minimum size that considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due 
included in this group are those nonaccrual or renegotiated loans which meet the criteria as being impaired under the definition in sfas a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
problem loans also include those credits that have been internally classified as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns 
ranges of loss are determined based on best and worst case scenarios for each loan 
reserves for homogeneous loan pools 
the company makes a significant number of loans and leases which  due to their underlying similar characteristics  are assessed for loss as homogeneous pools 
included in the homogeneous pools are loans and leases from the retail sector and commercial loans under a certain size  which have been excluded from the specific reserve allocation previously discussed 
the company segments the pools by type of loan or lease and using historical loss information estimates a loss reserve for each pool 
special reserve 
the company s senior lending management also allocates reserves for special situations  which are unique to the measurement period 
these include environmental factors  such as economic conditions in certain geographical or industry segments of the portfolio  economic trends in the retail lending sector and peer group loss history 
continuous credit monitoring processes and the analysis of loss components is the principal method relied upon by management to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are reflected in the company s allowance for credit losses on a timely basis 
management also considers experience of peer institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to the company s own experience 
loans  leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs 
the related provision for credit losses  which is charged to income  is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance to the level determined appropriate through application of the above process 
at year end  the company s total allowance was million which equates to approximately times and times the average charge offs for the last three and five years respectively  and and times the average net charge offs for the same three and five year periods  respectively 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  the company also gives consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
the company s charge off policy is generally consistent with regulatory standards 
historically  senior lending management in each of bnccorp s banking subsidiaries has been responsible for assessing the adequacy of the respective subsidiary s allowance for credit losses and making provision for credit losses recommendations to the appropriate board of directors 
however  the company s vice president chief internal credit review manager and chief credit officer now have the responsibility of affirming the company s allowance methodology  performing an annual credit loss migration analysis and assessing the allowance components in relation to estimated and actual charge off trends 
this analysis is presented to members of bnccorp s credit loss review committee who are responsible for assessing and reporting on the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses as well as recommending revisions to the company s methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance as they become necessary 
concentrations of credit risk are discussed under concentrations of credit 
concentrations exist in real estate  lodging and construction loans and commitments 
additionally  a geographic concentration of credit risk also arises because bnccorp has operated primarily in the upper midwest with percent of loans outstanding as of december  having been extended to customers in minnesota  north dakota and south dakota 
other groups of credit risk may not constitute a significant concentration  but are analyzed based on other evident risk factors for the purpose of determining an adequate allowance level 
nonperforming and potential problem loans are defined and discussed under nonperforming loans and assets and potential problem loans 
nonperforming loans increased from  at december  to million at december  many of these loans are specifically analyzed for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
of the million of nonperforming loans at december   million relates to two commercial customers 
estimating the risk and amount of loss on any loan is subjective and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
although management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual credit losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of the company s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require bnc to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  activity in the allowance for credit losses  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to operating expense  the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans  the ratio of the allowance to total loans at the end of each period and the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans analysis of allowance for credit losses for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance of allowance for credit losses  beginning of period      charge offs commercial and industrial    real estate mortgage agricultural consumer other lease financing total charge offs     recoveries commercial and industrial real estate mortgage agricultural consumer other lease financing total recoveries net charge offs    provision for credit losses charged to operations      balance of allowance for credit losses  end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average loans

in recent years  earning asset growth has outpaced core deposit growth resulting in the use of brokered and out of market certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
see borrowed funds 
this trend has been common in the banking industry because of the proliferation of non bank competitors and the multitude of financial and investment products available to customers as well as the need to utilize such funds in the process of the company s overall balance sheet management

capital resources and expenditures 
bnc s management actively monitors compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  including risk based and leverage capital measures

liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on the company s earnings or value 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a customer to perform according to the terms of a contract 
bnc is a party to transactions involving financial instruments that create risks that may or may not be reflected on a traditional balance sheet 
these financial instruments can be subdivided into three categories cash financial instruments  generally characterized as on balance sheet items  include investments  loans  mortgage based securities  deposits and other debt obligations 
credit related financial instruments  generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
derivative financial instruments  on balance sheet items as of january   include such instruments as interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity price and equity price contracts  including forwards  swaps and options 
the company s risk management policies are intended to monitor and limit exposure to liquidity  market and credit risks that arise from each of these financial instruments 
see loan portfolio for a discussion of the company s credit risk management strategies 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk management encompasses the company s ability to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
the objectives of liquidity management policies are to maintain adequate liquid assets  liability diversification among instruments  maturities and customers and a presence in both the wholesale purchased funds market and the retail deposit market 
the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements included under item present data on cash and cash equivalents provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities 
in addition to liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  bnc utilizes brokered deposits  sells securities under agreements to repurchase and borrows overnight federal funds 
the banks are members of the fhlb  which affords them the opportunity to borrow funds in terms ranging from overnight to ten years and beyond 
borrowings from the fhlb are generally collateralized by the banks mortgage loans and various investment securities

bnc s liquidity is measured by its ability to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity is supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines with the fhlb  credit lines with correspondent banks for federal funds  wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  brokered certificates of deposit and direct non brokered national certificates of deposit through national deposit networks 
bnc s management measures its liquidity position on a monthly basis 
key factors that determine the company s liquidity are the reliability or stability of its deposit base  the pledged non pledged status of its investments and potential loan demand 
bnc s liquidity management system divides the balance sheet into liquid assets  and short term liabilities that are assumed to be vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities is measured over a day planning horizon 
assumptions for short term liabilities vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions are based on a historical analysis of the month to month percentage changes in deposits 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities and other key factors such as expected loan demand as well as access to other sources of liquidity such as lines with the fhlb  federal funds  and those other supplemental sources listed above are tied together to provide a measure of the company s liquidity 
management has a targeted range and manages its operations such that these targets can be achieved 
management believes that its prudent management policies and guidelines will ensure adequate levels of liquidity to fund anticipated needs of on and off balance sheet items 
in addition  a contingency funding policy statement identifies actions to be taken in response to an adverse liquidity event 
forward looking statements statements included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company cautions readers that forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to the company s future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs and income  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements due to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks of loans and investments  including dependence on local economic conditions  competition for the company s customers from other providers of financial services  possible adverse effects of changes in interest rates  risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  and other risks which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
effects of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  banking organizations do not necessarily gain or lose due to the effects of inflation 
changes in interest rates  which are a major determinant of a financial service organization s profitability  do not necessarily correspond to changes in the prices of goods and services 
an analysis of a banking organization s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates and maintain profitability 
the financial statements and supplementary financial data have been prepared  primarily  on a historical basis which is mandated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
fluctuations in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s fasb s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  as amended  on january  sfas requires all derivative financial instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the fair value of the company s derivative financial instruments is determined based on quoted market prices for comparable transactions  if available  or a valuation model that calculates the present value of expected future cash flows 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are required to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires formal documentation designation and assessment of effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of the impact of the company s adoption of sfas on june   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  in july  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues sab 
sab expresses the sec staff s views on the development  documentation  and application of a systematic methodology as required by its financial reporting release no 
issued in december for determining allowances for loan and lease losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in particular  the guidance focuses on the documentation the staff normally would expect a registrant to prepare and maintain in support of its allowance for loan losses 
also in july  the federal banking agencies issued their policy statement on allowance for loan and lease losses methodologies and documentation for banks and savings institutions the policy statement 
developed in collaboration with the sec  the policy statement clarifies the agencies expectations and provides guidance regarding methodologies and documentation support for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
sab and the policy statement do not change the guidance in generally accepted accounting principles and in previous sec and regulatory agency statements but  rather  are intended to improve the allowance for loan and lease losses process and documentation 
therefore  adoption of these two issuances did not materially impact the company 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions than were included under the previous standards 
the company will adopt sfas on january   however  adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material impact 
critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses 
the company maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the loan and lease portfolio and other credit exposures are reviewed regularly to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  the company evaluates the allowance necessary for specific nonperforming loans and also estimates losses in other credit exposures 
the resultant three allowance components are as follows specific reserve 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of problem loans over a minimum size that considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due 
included in this group are those nonaccrual or renegotiated loans which meet the criteria as being impaired under the definition in sfas a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
problem loans also include those credits that have been internally classified as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns 
ranges of loss are determined based on best and worst case scenarios for each loan 
reserves for homogeneous loan pools 
the company makes a significant number of loans and leases which  due to their underlying similar characteristics  are assessed for loss as homogeneous pools 
included in the homogeneous pools are loans and leases from the retail sector and commercial loans under a certain size  which have been excluded from the specific reserve allocation previously discussed 
the company segments the pools by type of loan or lease and using historical loss information estimates a loss reserve for each pool 
special reserve 
the company s senior lending management also allocates reserves for special situations  which are unique to the measurement period 
these include environmental factors  such as economic conditions in certain geographical or industry segments of the portfolio  economic trends in the retail lending sector and peer group loss history 
continuous credit monitoring processes and the analysis of loss components is the principal method relied upon by management to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are reflected in the company s allowance for credit losses on a timely basis 
management also considers experience of peer institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to the company s own experience 
loans  leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs 
the related provision for credit losses  which is charged to income  is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance to the level determined appropriate through application of the above process 
mortgage servicing and transfers of financial assets 
the banks regularly sell loans to others on a non recourse basis 
sold loans are not included in the accompanying balance sheets 
the banks generally retain the right to service the loans as well as the right to receive a portion of the interest income on the loans 
at december  and  the banks were servicing loans for the benefit of others with aggregate unpaid principal balances of and million  respectively 
many of the loans sold by the banks are commercial lines of credit for which balances and related payment streams cannot be reasonably estimated in order to determine the fair value of the servicing rights and or future interest income retained by the banks 
upon sale  any unearned net loan fees or costs are recognized in income 
gains on sales of loans were   and for  and  respectively  and are included in fees on loans 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on an accrual basis for interest and dividend income on loans  investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing due from accounts 
noninterest income is recognized when it has been realized or is realizable and has been earned 
in accordance with existing accounting and industry standards  as well as recent guidance issued by the sec  the company considers revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists generally  there is contractual documentation  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  there can be no outstanding contingencies which could ultimately cause the revenue to be passed back to the payor 
in the isolated instances where these criteria have not been met  receipts are generally placed in escrow until such time as they can be recognized as revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on the company s earnings or value 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk can result from re pricing risk timing differences in the maturity re pricing of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  options risk the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  basis risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more different rates of similar maturity  and the resulting impact on the behavior of lending and funding rates  and yield curve risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more rates of different maturities from the same type of instrument 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
to date the company has not conducted trading activities as a means of managing interest rate risk 
bnc s asset liability management process is utilized to manage the company s interest rate risk 
the measurement of interest rate risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
the company s interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the objective of managing the level and potential volatility of net interest income in addition to the long term growth of equity  bearing in mind that the company will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not entirely possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the overall level of net interest income and equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to repricing or maturity characteristics 
access to the derivatives market can be an important element in maintaining the company s interest rate risk position within policy guidelines 
using derivative instruments  principally interest rate floors and caps  the interest rate sensitivity of specific transactions  as well as pools of assets or liabilities  is adjusted to maintain the desired interest rate risk profile 
see loan portfolio interest rate caps and floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of the company s accounting policies pertaining to such instruments 
the company s primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk is net interest income simulation 
this exercise includes management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  now  money market and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
interest rate caps and floors are included to the extent that they are exercised in the month simulation period 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage  collateralized mortgage obligations  and mortgage backed securities portfolios in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
finally  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
the company monitors the results of net interest income simulation on a quarterly basis at regularly scheduled asset liability management committee meetings 
each quarter net interest income is simulated for the upcoming month horizon in seven interest scenarios 
the scenarios modeled are parallel interest ramps of bp  bp  and bp along with a rates unchanged scenario 
the parallel movement of interest rates means all projected market interest rates move up or down by the same amount 
a ramp in interest rates means that the projected change in market interest rates occurs over the month horizon projected 
for example  in the bp scenario  the projected prime rate will decrease from its starting point at december  of percent to percent months later 
the prime rate in this example will decrease th of the overall decrease of basis points each month 
given the historically low absolute level of market interest rates as of december   the declining rate scenario analyses were limited to bp and bp for the summary table presented below 
the net interest income simulation results for the month horizon that covers the calendar year of is shown below 
the growth assumption used for this simulation was based on the growth projections built into the company s budget 
the impact of each interest rate scenario on projected net interest income is displayed before and after the impact of the million cumulative notional year interest rate cap positions on month libor with a strike and the million cumulative notional year interest rate cap positions on month libor with a strike 
the impact of the cap positions is calculated by determining the fair value of the contracts at the end of the month horizon using an interest rate option valuation model 
the change in fair value plus any expected cash flow in the various rate scenarios is summed to determine the total net benefit cost of the portfolio of interest rate cap contracts

on january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see loan portfolio interest rate caps and floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial investments and the adoption of sfas the company s rate sensitivity position over the projected twelve month horizon is asset sensitive 
this is evidenced by the projected increase of net interest income in the rising interest rate scenarios  and the decrease in net interest income in falling rate scenarios 
static gap analysis is another tool which may be used for interest rate risk measurement 
the net differences between the amount of assets  liabilities  equity and off balance sheet instruments repricing within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position or gap position 
the following table sets forth the company s rate sensitivity position as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever occurs first interest sensitivity gap analysis estimated maturity or repricing at december  over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash equivalents   investment securities      fixed rate loans     floating rate loans     total interest earning assets 
     interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts    savings   time deposits under      time deposits  and over 
    borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities     interest rate gap      cumulative interest rate gap at december      cumulative interest rate gap to total assets investment securities are generally reported in the timeframe representing the earliest of repricing date  call date for callable securities  estimated life or maturity date 
estimated lives of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on published industry prepayment estimates for securities with comparable weighted average interest rates and contractual maturities 
loans are stated gross of the allowance for credit losses and are placed in the earliest timeframe in which maturity or repricing may occur 
the table assumes that all savings and interest bearing demand deposits reprice in the earliest period presented  however  bnc s management believes a significant portion of these accounts constitute a core component and are generally not rate sensitive 
management s position is supported by the fact that aggressive reductions in interest rates paid on these deposits historically has not caused notable reductions in balances 
the table does not necessarily indicate the future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
static gap analysis does not fully capture the impact of embedded options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  or certain off balance sheet sensitivities to interest rate movements 
therefore  this tool cannot be used in isolation to determine the level of interest rate risk exposure in more complex banking institutions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  these analyses are not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of changes in market interest rates such as those indicated above on the company 
further  this analysis is based on the company s assets and liabilities as of december  with forward adjustments for planned growth and anticipated business activities and does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates
