overview the company has experienced improved pricing over the last eighteen to twenty four months even though excess capacity and price competition exist in the land based seismic industry 
the company s revenues were negatively impacted due to unfavorable weather and difficulty in obtaining permits for rights of way during fiscal production increases obtainable with favorable weather and timely permits for rights of way will significantly improve the company s operating results 
demand for the company s services is related to crude oil and natural gas prices 
as discussed below in results of operations and in note of the notes to financial statements  depreciation expense was reduced for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal due to a change in the estimate of the lives of certain assets based on the technology of certain seismic data recording equipment consisting of the central electronic components and of energy source units 
the company believes that advancements in the foreseeable future will consist of upgrades that may require replacements of modules of the central electronics 
the company believes that the current fleet of energy source units will provide service beyond the life originally estimated due to actual performance in the past and to the redesign of the unit 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  the company s operating revenues decreased from  to  in fiscal year the company began fiscal with five crews operating and operated four or five crews throughout most of the year depending on weather conditions and the ability to obtain permits for rights of way

operating expenses in fiscal remained relatively flat as compared to fiscal as the company maintained staffing for five crews throughout the year 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  an increase of  from fiscal insurance premiums  salary reclassification as compared to fiscal  and additional promotional expense in celebration of the company s th anniversary primarily account for this increase 
the company has not made a provision for bad debts in fiscal as relatively favorable prices for crude oil and natural gas have correlated to collectibility of accounts receivable 
depreciation for fiscal totaled  a decrease of from fiscal as discussed in note of the notes to financial statements  the company revised the estimated lives of two classes of seismic equipment 
the effect of the change is a reduction in depreciation expense and net loss of approximately  the decrease in depreciation expense includes a modest effect resulting from a suspension of capital expansion beginning in fiscal due to industry conditions

no income tax expense was recorded for fiscal due to a pretax loss 
the company had no income tax benefit remaining due to the establishment of a valuation allowance offset by an increase in pretax loss 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal primarily reflects the net loss offset by depreciation and of changes in working capital components 
the decrease in depreciation expense is discussed above and in note of the notes to financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities reflects capital expenditures and the acquisition of short term investments during the fiscal year 
capital expenditures 
the company continually strives to supply market demand with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording systems and leading edge data processing capabilities 
capital expenditures for fiscal consisted primarily of data acquisition channels that became available late in the year as a result of the idle capacity that exists in our industry 
the company maintains equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased demand of the company s services 
in addition the company continues to monitor the development of the three component seismic approach 
the company feels that it is in position to respond to demand for this technological advancement of the seismic industry

critical accounting policies the following accounting policies require management assumptions and estimates which could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
revenue recognition

amounts billed to clients are recorded in revenue at the gross amount including out of pocket expenses which will be reimbursed by the client 
allowance for doubtful accounts

the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of the company s clients 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the asset s recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment is required if future expected net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the amounts 
management s forecast of future cash flow used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and future gross margins 
if the company is unable to achieve these cash flows  management s estimates would be revised resulting in an impairment charge in the period of revision 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment is capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
management s estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available  these estimates could change 
as described in note of the notes to financial statements  the company has revised the estimated lives of two classes of seismic equipment

statement also describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
the statement also establishes a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption encouraged 
the company will adopt this statement in fiscal year ending september  and does not expect a significant impact to its financial statements

as of september   the carrying value of the investments approximates fair value 
the company has not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
the company does not currently conduct business internationally  so it is generally not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
