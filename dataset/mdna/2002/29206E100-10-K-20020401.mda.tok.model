item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a distributor of value added  semi finished aluminum products 
consequently  the company s sales volume has been  and will continue to be  a function of its ongoing ability to secure quality aluminum products from its suppliers 
while the company maintains long term supply relationships with several foreign mills  one supplier accounted for approximately of the company s purchases for the year ended december   and three suppliers accounted for of purchases 
results of operations the merger between integrated and empire was completed on september  for accounting and other financial reporting purposes  the merger has been treated as a reverse acquisition 
under this treatment  the company has been treated as a continuation of empire  and the merger has been treated as an issuance of shares by empire to the stockholders of integrated in exchange for integrated s cash 
accordingly  the accompanying financial statements include the historical financial statements of empire and empire pacific  and include the results of operations of integrated only from september   the effective date of the merger 
fiscal years ended december  and net sales decreased by million or from million in to million in the weaker economy and weaker demand for industrial products coupled with declining prices resulted in this reduction in sales 
this decline in sales was also reflected in lower gross profit for the year gross profit declined by from million to million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was relatively constant at approximately 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined by 
million or approximately as the result of cost saving measures instituted during the year  including legal fees  travel and entertainment 
non cash compensation was also lower as a result of a reduced number of shares vesting 
interest expense declined million or from million to million as a result of reduced interest rates and reductions in loan balances from a high of million in to million at the end of income taxes in included million of state taxes  net of federal tax benefits  pertaining to periods prior to the merger as described under market for common equity and related stockholder matters capital contribution by stockholders 
adjusting for this prior period tax  taxes for the period increased by approximately 
million as a result of the increase in income before taxes for the year net income was million for compared to million for fiscal years ended december  and net sales increased million or from million in to million in the increase in sales in resulted from the increased availability of material from a principal supplier after this supplier completed a mill expansion 
gross profit increased million or from million in to million in as a result of the increase in sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from to as a result of higher purchasing costs  more favorable sales terms and operating inefficiencies relating to material handling and product staging associated with the sharply increased sales volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or from million in to million in as a result of a non cash compensation charge of million see accounting treatment of restricted stock agreement  below  increased staffing costs associated with customer service  costs related to employment contracts with certain executive officers see certain agreements entered into with executive officers  professional fees and costs of operating as a public company 
interest expense increased million or from million in to million in the increase in interest expense is related to higher levels of outstanding bank indebtedness required in order to fund the company s higher inventory and other working capital needs 
income taxes increased million from in to million in due to the change in the tax status of the company and because of a state tax assessment for prior years recorded in prior to the merger  empire had been taxed as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes 
in general  the income or loss of an s corporation is passed through to its owners rather than being subject to tax at the entity level 
post merger the company has been taxed as a c corporation 
as a result  income taxes reflect state and local income tax for the whole year and federal income tax only for the period from september  to december   while taxes reflect federal  state and local taxes for the entire period 
consequently  for comparative purposes  the company has presented pro forma income taxes as if the company had been taxed as a c corporation for all of  together with the resulting pro forma net income for that year 
in addition  income taxes in included million of state taxes  net of federal tax benefits  pertaining to periods prior to the merger as described under market for common equity and related stockholder matters capital contribution by stockholders 
the change in the company s income tax status had a significant impact on net income 
the company reported net income of million for  compared to net income of million for the net income for was million or lower than pro forma net income of million net of pro forma income taxes for accounting treatment of restricted stock agreement the company and nathan and sandra kahn entered into a restricted stock agreement with mr 
wrubel on september  mr 
wrubel is currently vice president of sales of the company 
pursuant to the restricted stock agreement  the kahns transferred to mr 
wrubel  shares restricted shares of common stock of the company which represents a portion of the shares that were received by the kahns in the merger 
the restricted shares were comprised of i  shares the non contingent restricted shares that vest on september th of   and subject only to the condition that mr 
wrubel continue to be employed by the company as of the vesting date  and ii  shares the contingent restricted shares that were subject to the same vesting criteria as the non contingent restricted shares and  in addition  were subject to the condition that the number of shares if any that will vest will be a function of the after tax net income of the company over a specified period 
under applicable accounting rules  the share transfer is being treated as if the company had issued the shares to mr 
wrubel as compensation for services and  accordingly  the company is required to recognize an expense relating thereto 
the expense relating to the non contingent restricted shares is based on the fair market value of the stock as of the grant date and is being recognized over the vesting period 
the company recognized  of such expense through december   and will recognize  of expense in the earnings targets required for issuance of the contingent restricted shares were not achieved and these shares were retired in recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no

the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but tested for impairment at least annually  while intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the statement also establishes guidance for testing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for however  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  are subject immediately to the provisions of sfas the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas and will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as of january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for liquidity and capital resources the company s cash balance decreased million  to million  in the year ended december  net cash of million was provided by operating activities  while million of net cash was used in financing activities 
the million of net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of repayment of borrowings of million under the company s line of credit  and the acquisition of million of treasury stock under its stock buy back program 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventories of million and net income of million  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable 
empire currently operates under a revolving line of credit  including a commitment to issue letters of credit  with three commercial banks 
the available line was million as of december  borrowings under these lines of credit are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of empire s assets 
under these credit agreements  empire is required to maintain working capital and net worth ratios 
these facilities expire on june  as of december   the amount outstanding under the company s revolving lines of credit was million excluding letters of credit of approximately million 
management believes that cash from operations  together with funds available under its credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements relating to the company s existing operations for the next twelve months 
empire may require additional debt or equity financing in connection with the future expansion of its operations 
commitments and contingencies empire has contingent liabilities in the form of letters of credit to some of its suppliers 
as of december   empire s outstanding letters of credit amounted to approximately million 
under the terms of some of its supply contracts  the company is required to take minimum tonnages as specified in those contracts 
as a result  the company could  under certain circumstances  be forced to sell the required tonnage at a loss 
capital contribution by stockholders results of operations for include a provision for an adjustment to state income taxes relating to empire s earnings before the merger 
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  the former stockholders of empire have contributed capital to the company in an amount sufficient to indemnify it for these taxes 
as a result of this event  total stockholders equity as of december  has been increased by  certain factors affecting future operating results the company is highly dependent on a few suppliers 
the company purchased approximately of its products from one supplier in as a result  the termination or limitation by this supplier of its relationship with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company s loss of any one of its other suppliers or material default by any such supplier in its obligations to the company due to bankruptcy  financial difficulties  expropriation  social unrest  destruction  sabotage  strikes  acquisition by a person or entity unwilling to provide products to the company  or for any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is highly dependent on a few significant customers 
the company s sales are highly concentrated to a few customers 
in  of the company s revenues were derived from sales to ten customers 
as a result  any material reduction in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s supply sources are subject to substantial risks 
the company generally purchases aluminum products from foreign suppliers 
thus  its operations could be materially and adversely affected by changes in economic  political and social conditions in the countries where the company currently purchases or may in the future purchase such products 
among other things  changes in laws  regulations  or the interpretation thereof  or restrictions on currency conversions and exports  could negatively affect the company s business 
although the trend in the markets in which the company operates for its sourcing has been towards open markets and trade policies and the fostering of private economic activity  no assurance can be given that the governments will continue to pursue these policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered  especially in the event of a change in the leadership  or as a result of social or political upheaval or unforeseen circumstances affecting economic  political or social life 
consolidation of suppliers may materially affect the company s operations 
during the last several years  consolidations have been taking place among aluminum suppliers 
although the company has in the past successfully replaced any suppliers lost as a result of industry consolidations  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace the volume of production or the type of products supplied by any of its current vendors  if they were acquired or their operations terminated or were interrupted 
changing aluminum prices could impact the company s profit margins 
the company relies on long term relationships with its suppliers  but generally has no long term  fixed price purchase contracts  it purchases at prevailing market prices at the time orders are placed  with discounts for quantity purchases 
the aluminum industry is highly cyclical  and the prices that the company pays for aluminum and the prices it charges will be influenced by a variety of factors outside of its control  including general economic conditions both domestic and international  competition  production levels  import duties and other trade restrictions  and currency fluctuations 
while the company hedges metal pricing and foreign currency as it deems appropriate for a portion of its purchase and sales contracts  there exists the risk of a counterparty default in fulfilling the hedge contract 
should there be a counterparty default  the company could be exposed to losses on the original hedged contract 
if suppliers fail to provide products of sufficient quality customer relationships and prices could be negatively affected 
the company s relationships with its customers depend  in part  on its ability to deliver products of the quality specified by those customers 
the company obtains certifications from its suppliers as to the quality of the products being supplied 
however  if the product is not of the quality certified or if a supplier fails to deliver products ordered by the company  the company may be forced to buy product of the specified quality from another source to fulfill the customer s order 
while the company would then be left with a claim against the supplier for any loss sustained by the company  the company may not be able to successfully prosecute these claims  particularly in foreign jurisdictions 
the company may be required to purchase minimum tonnages under the terms of some of its supply contracts  the company may be required to take minimum tonnages which it subsequently finds it is unable to sell at a profit 
the company is exposed to credit risk from its customers 
the company does not require collateral for customer receivables 
the company has significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions  which may impair the collectability of these receivables 
the company carries credit insurance with a co pay provision and specific limits on each customer s receivables 
the company s failure to collect a significant portion of the amount due on its receivables directly from customers or through insurance claims or other material default by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
increased tariffs could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
during  in excess of of sales of the company represented sales of aluminum products from countries that were considered developing countries whose exports were eligible for preferential tariff treatment upon import into the united states under the generalized system of preference gsp 
there can be no assurance that any of our suppliers will continue to be eligible for such preferential tariff treatment or that the generalized system of preference will be renewed in any given year after it expired on september  if the preferential tariff treatment of any of our suppliers that are currently eligible for such treatment becomes unavailable  then imports from such supplier may be subjected to a tariff  instead of the duty free treatment those imports now enjoy 
to the extent these increased costs could not be passed on to its customers  the company s profit margins could be negatively affected 
this could result in higher costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gsp legislation has in the past been renewed either prior to expiration or thereafter  on a retroactive basis to the date of expiration 
this does not guarantee that it will be renewed in the same manner this year 
antidumping and other duties could be imposed on the company  its suppliers and their products 
the imposition of an antidumping or other increased duty on any products imported by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
under united states law  an antidumping duty may be imposed on any imports if two conditions are met 
first  the department of commerce must decide that the imports are being sold in the united states at less than fair value 
second  the international trade commission the itc must determine that the united states industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports 
the itc s determination of injury involves a two prong inquiry first  whether the industry is materially injured  and second  whether the dumping  not other factors  caused the injury 
the itc is required to analyze the volume of imports  the effect of imports on united states prices for like merchandise  and the effects the imports have on united states producers of like products  taking into account many factors  including lost sales  market share  profits  productivity  return on investment  and utilization of production capacity 
further  the company as part of its course of business is engaged in the importation of steel wire rod 
such products are currently subject to import quota  and all applicable duties 
in addition  the us department of commerce is currently investigating whether to levy additional anti dumping and or counterveiling duties 
if the final determination is found in the affirmative  it may adversely affect the company s ability to expand its business further into steel products 
in addition  should such duties be imposed on a retroactive basis  the company may be exposed to significant damage and expense 
if the company fails to deliver products on a timely basis  it may suffer losses 
interruption of shipping schedules upon which the company relies for foreign purchases could result in untimely deliveries to the company s customers or cause the company to purchase the products in the united states at a higher cost in order to meet delivery schedules 
consequently  the company s profit margins could be reduced or it could suffer losses 
the company guarantees its customers that it will deliver products within the period specified in their purchase orders 
any interruption of the means of transportation used by the company to transport products could cause delays in delivery of products  could force the company to buy the products from domestic suppliers at a higher cost in order to fulfill its commitments  and also could result in the loss of the customer 
the company competes with companies with captive sources of supply 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger than the company and many have captive sources of supply and access to greater capital and other resources 
thus  if the company s sources of supply are interrupted  its competitors could be in a position to capture the company s customers 
the company is dependent on its executive officers 
the company is highly dependent on its executive officers  the loss of any of one of which could have a significant adverse impact on the company s business
