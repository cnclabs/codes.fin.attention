the company may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock or a combination of both 
the convertible notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of anixter inc anixter 
on october   the company entered into two financing arrangements to support further business growth 
the agreements consisted of a million  senior unsecured  revolving credit agreement and a million accounts receivable securitization program 
the new revolving credit line included a million  five year agreement  plus a million  day agreement 
on april   anixter inc cancelled the million  day revolving credit line 
accordingly  the company recorded an extraordinary loss on the early extinquishment of debt in of million million  net of tax to expense the financing fees associated with this portion of the revolving credit agreement 
on october   the company reduced the borrowing capacity on the accounts receivable securitization program from million to million 
the accounts receivable securitization program is conducted through anixter receivables corporation arc  which is a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the company accounted for using the equity method 
the program allows the company to sell  on an ongoing basis without recourse  a majority of the accounts receivable originating in the united states to arc and consists of a series of day facilities 
arc may in turn sell an interest in these receivables to a financial institution and borrow up to million 
prior to october   arc could borrow up to million 
the securitization program began in october  at which time million of gross accounts receivable were sold and removed from the balance sheet 
at december  and december   the outstanding balance of accounts receivable sold to arc totaled million and million  respectively 
in order to fund the purchase of the accounts receivable from anixter  arc has incurred long term debt of million and million and has a subordinated note payable to anixter of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the effective interest rate paid by arc in and on the long term debt was and  respectively 
arc long term debt has not been guaranteed by anixter or the company and neither have an obligation  contingent or otherwise  to the holders of arc long term debt 
under this program arc is required to maintain delinquency  loss to liquidation and dilution ratios that are normal for this type of arrangement 
as of december   arc was within of the maximum allowed under the delinquency ratio 
the company does not believe it is necessary to amend the ratio at this time 
a charge of million  primarily relating to the discount on the initial sale of accounts receivable to arc  was recorded at inception of the program in the fourth quarter the company expects to substantially recover the charge during the course of the program 
in other expenses  the company recorded net charges of million and million in and  respectively  primarily for the interest expense on the long term debt incurred by arc to fund the purchases of the accounts receivable from anixter 
in september  anixter filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to offer from time to time up to a million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes 
on september   anixter issued million of these notes due september the notes  which bear interest at  contain various restrictions with respect to secured borrowings and are unconditionally guaranteed by the company 
during  anixter repurchased million of its senior notes for million 
accordingly  the company recorded an extraordinary loss on the early extinquishment of debt of million million  net of tax in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  these notes have a put provision that under certain circumstances is triggered by a rating downgrade 
at december   the outstanding balance of the notes was million which was under the cross default thresholds of anixter and the company s other existing indebtedness 
therefore  anixter and the company were not exposed to any potentially adverse effects from this provision 
at december   million was available under the bank revolving lines of credit at anixter  of which million was available to pay the company for intercompany liabilities 
the primary liquidity source for anixter is the million revolving credit agreement for which no borrowings were outstanding at december  this revolving credit agreement requires certain financial ratios to be maintained 
the most restrictive financial ratios are the fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio 
as of december   anixter s operating results exceeded the minimum required under the fixed charge coverage ratio by 
if results for are significantly lower than planned  the restricted financial ratio provisions would be in default and the borrowings callable 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in all other anixter and company debt agreements  all outstanding debt would then become due and payable 
while the company does not expect to default under this agreement  if that were to occur  the company believes it would be able to obtain a waiver or amendment from the lenders on reasonable terms 
due to the requirement of the leverage ratio  borrowings of only million of the million available under bank revolving lines of credit at anixter would be permitted as of december  in  the company estimates that it will have positive cash flow from operating activities and after capital expenditures 
the company will continue to pursue opportunities to repurchase outstanding debt  with the volume and timing to depend on market conditions 
as of march   anixter has repurchased an additional million of its senior notes that mature in september  for million and  of its convertible notes that mature in june for million

in  inventory increased million  million of which represented inventories returnable to vendors  to support the growth in the service provider and integrated supply markets and a significant competitive local exchange carrier contract

during previous years  the company had entered into interest rate agreements that effectively fix or cap  for a period of time  the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate obligations 
at december   the company had only million in variable borrowings outstanding under the bank revolving lines of credit  for which no interest rate hedge agreements were in place 
total outstanding debt at december   was million for the company and million for arc

critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are critical areas which either require judgement by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve as stated below customers that have refused to pay their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages 
risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default 
the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  higher lower than expected defaults or an unexpected material change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at december   the company reported inventory of million 
each quarter the company reviews the excess inventory and makes an assessment of the realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following a return or rotation privileges with vendors  b price protection from vendors  c expected usage during the next twenty four months  d whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  e current market pricing  and f risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances change ie  unexpected shift in market demand  pricing or customer defaults there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventory 
deferred tax assets the company applies a three year cumulative taxable income test for foreign subsidiaries whose results are not included in the us tax return in determining whether to recognize an income tax benefit for their respective foreign nol carryforwards  with a resultant adjustment to the valuation allowance 
qualitative factors surrounding a particular subsidiary are also examined  and in certain circumstances eg  projections of further losses for that subsidiary in the short term  an income tax benefit may not be recorded and therefore  the valuation allowance not adjusted even when the three year cumulative taxable income is positive for a given subsidiary 
life insurance policies anixter implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan on january  the plan permits selected employees to make pre tax deferrals of salary and bonus 
the plan provides for benefit payments upon retirement  death  disability or termination 
concurrent with the implementation of the deferred compensation plan  anixter purchased variable  separate account life insurance policies on the lives of the participants 
to fund additional liabilities  anixter purchased fixed  general account increasing whole life insurance policies on the lives of certain participants in both the deferred compensation plan and the excess defined benefit plan 
all of the above policies are owned by anixter and anixter pays level annual premiums on them 
policy proceeds are payable to anixter upon the insured participant s death 
the cash surrender values on those policies are updated quarterly 
at december  and december   the cash surrender value of million and million  respectively  was recorded under this program and reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the value of the investment was recorded at market value determined by the performance of the underlying investments in the market 
the company s investment in the cash surrender value program is liquid and redeemable in whole or part by surrendering the underlying life insurance policies 
as the life insurance policies are recorded at market value  changes in the market value of the underlying securities can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
foreign denominated assets and liabilities at december   the company had a significant amount of assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
such net assets at december   were approximately million 
the company has purchased approximately million of short term foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
if there was a percent adverse change in exchange rates  the company would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
pension expense the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension benefit cost relates to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
the company has not made contributions to the us pension plan since sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of the net benefit cost from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets  as significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
over the long term  the company s pension plan assets have earned in excess of  therefore  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the net periodic benefit cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than in the last two years 
should this trend continue  future benefit costs would likely increase 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected the net periodic benefit cost 
the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
at december   the company s consolidated pension liability was million  up from million at the end of for the year ended december   the company recognized consolidated pre tax net periodic benefit cost of million  down from million in in  the company incurred a million loss on settlement of a supplemental employee retirement plan 
as a result of the decline in the fair value of the pension plan assets  along with a reduced discount rate  the company estimates its net periodic benefit cost to increase by to 
tax contingencies the company believes it has a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions it takes on the various tax returns it files 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may take opposing views on some issues  that the costs and hazards of litigation in maintaining the positions that the company has taken on various returns might be significant and that the taxing authorities may prevail in their attempts to overturn such positions  the company maintains tax reserves 
the amounts of such reserves  the potential issues they are intended to cover and their adequacy to do so  are topics of frequent review internally and with outside tax professionals 
where necessary  adjustments are periodically made to such reserves to reflect the lapsing of statutes of limitations  closings of ongoing examinations or the commencement of new examinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currencies  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income 
see critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  note interest rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts and note debt of the consolidated financial statements for further detail on interest agreements and debt obligations outstanding 
in the past  the company has entered into interest rate agreements that effectively fix or cap the libor component of the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate obligations 
at december   the company had minimal variable debt outstanding and as a result  had no interest rate agreements outstanding 
approximately and of debt obligations at december  and december   respectively  was fixed or capped 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its derivatives and other financial instruments assuming a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates and a percent adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding  and holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would have increased interest expense by million and million and decreased the value of foreign currency forward contracts by million and million in and  respectively 
in and  the fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was million and million  respectively 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would decrease or increase by and for and  respectively 
changes in the market value of the company s debt does not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
these analyses did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
