recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 which is effective for business combinations completed after june   requires among other things  that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations  specific criteria be established for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill and additional information about acquired intangible assets be provided 
sfas no 
 which will become effective for the company prospectively as of february   primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
among other things  it requires that goodwill not be amortized for financial statement purposes  instead  management will be required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
while the company is still analyzing the effect of sfas no 
on the financial statements  a preliminary estimate of the annual amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets that will cease in the fiscal year ending january  is approximately million 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which excludes from the definition of long lived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a business 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted and  in general  are to be applied prospectively 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
effective february  and does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following the company s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated and amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill  subsequent to october   totaling approximately million are being amortized over forty years through january  subsequent to january   goodwill will no longer be amortized  instead management will be required to test for impairment of goodwill annually 
a preliminary estimate of the annual amortization of goodwill that will cease in the fiscal year ending january  is approximately 
million 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 
factors that may affect future results met pro s prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risk 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
met pro s results may differ materially from its current results and actual results could differ materially from those suggested in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events  other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in met pro s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following important factors  along with those discussed elsewhere in this annual report  could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements o materially adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us or in significant customers of ours  o material changes in available technology  o failure in execution of acquisition strategy  o losses related to international sales  o changes in our accounting rules promulgated by regulatory agencies  including the sec  which could result in an impact on earnings  o unexpected results in our product development activities  o changes in our existing management  o failure to properly execute customer orders  including misspecifications  design  engineering or production errors  and o changes in federal or state laws
