such sales totaled  a increase over the  achieved in fiscal fiscal net sales totaled  segment sales trends in fiscal were generally similar to those of fiscal with increased sales of the specialty foods segment being offset by declines in sales of the company s non food segments 
competitive market conditions and an unsettled economy adversely affected sales of automotive products  glassware and candles 
the relative proportion of sales and operating income contributed by each of the company s business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix and related operating income percentages achieved by the business segments over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles automotive segment operating income specialty foods glassware and candles automotive expressed as a percentage of consolidated net sales expressed as a percentage of the related segment s net sales the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in and in the most recent year s decline in margins was primarily attributable to lower margins attained in the glassware and candles segment due to the impact of such factors as competitive pricing conditions and lower plant utilization 
the margins of the specialty foods segment were also somewhat lower in fiscal as influenced by higher levels of trade promotions  which are reflected as reductions to net sales 
gross margins within the automotive segment increased as a result of the benefits of higher production efficiencies  somewhat lower material costs and the decision to exit certain lower margin floor mat business 
compared to fiscal  the decline in the fiscal gross margin percentage reflected the company s non food business segments experiencing a generally more competitive pricing environment  a less favorable sales mix brought about by the decline in sales of candles  substantially higher energy costs  less overhead absorption on lower production volumes and certain instances of increased material costs 
the effect of these issues was mitigated by somewhat improved margins in the specialty foods segment as influenced by an improved retail sales mix and more favorable commodity costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled  and increased from the total of  the fiscal total included a second quarter provision for bad debts within the glassware and candles segment of approximately million related to the company s accounts receivable exposure to kmart corporation  which filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in january for fiscal  total selling  general and administrative expenses were  less than the fiscal total of  however  the fiscal amount included a bad debt provision of approximately million relating to the january bankruptcy of a large national foodservice distributor 
weaker results in the glassware and candles segment resulted in consolidated operating income for fiscal of  declining by compared to fiscal income of  the fiscal total had also declined from fiscal operating income totaling  overall  compared to fiscal  fiscal results reflected strong improvement in the specialty foods segment exceeded by declining contributions from the two non food segments 
components of other income and expense  including interest  in the consolidated statements of income were affected in the most recent year by lowered levels of debt and interest rates 
additionally  in february  consistent with notice previously provided to the company by the us treasury department in january  the company received approximately million under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of cdsoa 
this amount was recorded within fiscal as other income in the accompanying financial statements 
cdsoa  which applies to the company s candle operations  is in its first year of effectiveness and is intended to redress the unfair dumping of imported products through annual cash payments to eligible affected companies 
in september  the company filed with the us customs service another certification for claim of additional distribution under cdsoa 
however  payments  if any  to be received by the company in fiscal and any future year under cdsoa are subject to many variables outside the control of the company and  accordingly  the related amounts are not subject to reasonable estimation at the present time

this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  segment review specialty foods record levels of both net sales and earnings were again achieved by the specialty foods segment during fiscal net sales during fiscal totaled  a increase over the prior year s total of  fiscal sales had also increased over the fiscal total of  the percentage of sales to retail customers for this segment was approximately during fiscal compared to in each of the prior two years 
sales growth to retail customers over the last two years has been influenced by both the continued strength of the frozen bread product lines and the two acquisitions made during fiscal these acquisitions contributed approximately million in incremental sales volume during their first year of operations within the segment  including million in fiscal foodservice sales also increased through this period as a result of well received product development efforts for existing national account customers as well as sales to new national account customers 
the specialty foods segment s operating income in fiscal totaled  an increase over the fiscal total of  the level was  or  above the fiscal level of  the increase in fiscal s operating income was principally driven by the benefits of higher sales volumes 
margins associated with retail customers were constrained by increased promotional activities  and foodservice pricing was adversely affected by the extent of competitive market activities 
in general  the impact of year over year variations in raw material costs was relatively small 
in comparing fiscal to fiscal  it should be noted that fiscal results included a bad debt provision of approximately  resulting from the january bankruptcy of a large foodservice distributor that primarily serviced large national restaurant chains 
although also impairing fiscal cash flows  this bankruptcy did not materially affect the segment s net sales 
absent this charge  the segment s operating income for fiscal would have increased by approximately over the prior year s level 
also contributing to fiscal s increased income were the greater sales volumes  an improving retail mix  better capacity utilization and lower raw material costs 
segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment during fiscal totaled  and declined compared to fiscal net sales of  similarly  compared to net sales in fiscal totaling  fiscal sales declined by  or 
of influence throughout all of this segment s product lines in fiscal and was the presence of generally softer economic conditions 
the decline in both years was primarily attributable to year over year declines in candle sales to mass merchants 
this trend was first experienced beginning the second half of fiscal factors contributing to the decline in the sales of the segment s candles were an apparent softening in the consumer demand of candles within the mass market  heightened competition from imported product and the development of substantially more competitive market pricing conditions 
the segment s operating income totaled  during fiscal  a decline from the prior year s total of  compared to fiscal operating income of  fiscal income declined by 
over the last two years  in addition to the effects of the lower volume and competitive pricing conditions  income was adversely affected by a less favorable sales mix  and lower production levels leading to greater amounts of unabsorbed overhead in both candle and glassware manufacturing operations 
affecting just fiscal results was the january bankruptcy filing of kmart corporation 
in addition to recording a related bad debt provision of million during fiscal  the segment s sales to this customer have been adversely affected by the impact of the reorganization process on kmart corporation s sales 
other issues negatively impacting fiscal results were expenses associated with a prolonged labor strike at a consumer glassware facility and unabsorbed costs associated with a scheduled rebuild of a glass melting tank 
the foregoing issues were somewhat mitigated by the benefit of liquidations of lifo inventory acquired at lower costs in prior years 
such liquidations reduced cost of sales by  in fiscal many of the effects of the decline in sales volume persist into fiscal  and management is reviewing how to most optimally utilize the capacity of this segment s manufacturing facilities  including its two consumer glassware facilities in particular 
segment review automotive net sales of the automotive segment during fiscal totaled  a decline from the prior year s sales level of  fiscal sales declined from the record sales level of  achieved in fiscal consistent with the trend noted in fiscal  the overall sales of aluminum truck accessories in fiscal increased as a result of new product lines being sold to original equipment manufacturers oems 
however  generally more unsettled economic conditions that began in fiscal adversely impacted the sales of many of the segment s other products  especially in the aftermarket 
additionally  certain floor mat lines with oems were exited during based on management s analysis that an adequate contribution margin would not be provided in the future 
operating income of the automotive segment totaled  for fiscal  a substantial increase from the prior year s total of  the improvement in fiscal results was primarily attributable to greater production efficiencies achieved within the floor mat operations  generally lower material costs  less need for inventory obsolescence provisions and higher capacity utilization occurring within the aluminum accessory operations 
price reductions among certain oem programs mitigated the extent of the increase in segment income 
compared to fiscal operating income of  segment income in fiscal declined 
this decline was influenced by the lower sales volume  a less favorable sales mix  the impact of scheduled price reductions with certain oems  somewhat higher raw material costs and the lower volume leading to less overhead absorption 
the decision to exit certain low margin floor mat lines in fiscal also resulted in additional inventory obsolescence reserves being provided 
this segment s sales to oems are made both directly to the oems and indirectly through third party  tier suppliers 
such sales are sensitive to the overall rate of new vehicle sales  the availability of competitive alternatives and the tier supplier s ongoing ability to maintain its relationship with the oems 
additionally  the extent of pricing flexibility associated with these sales continues to be particularly limited with certain products subject to annual price reductions 
during  sales to oems comprised of this segment s sales compared to and in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the continued strength of cash flows from operations resulted in the company becoming debt free during the fiscal year ended june  management believes that this low level of leverage provides the company with considerable flexibility to acquire businesses complementary in function to that of the company s existing operations  continue historical levels of share repurchases and otherwise meet ongoing liquidity requirements 
the company maintains a revolving credit arrangement with several commercial banks totaling  terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
during fiscal  the expiration date of this agreement was extended by one year to february with all other terms and conditions remaining otherwise unchanged 
management believes that internally generated funds  the existing credit facilities and an ability to obtain additional financing  if desired  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 
the company s cash flows for the fiscal years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing the company s internal growth 
cash provided from operating activities in fiscal totaled  a increase over the prior year s total of  and over the fiscal total of  reductions in inventory led to the improved fiscal amounts 
similarly sized working capital reductions are not expected to reoccur in fiscal within working capital  accounts receivable at june  increased slightly above year ago levels by approximately and inventories decreased nearly 
consolidated accounts receivable levels benefited from an increased mix of specialty foods sales  while inventories within the non food segments fell due  in part  to a concentrated effort over the last year to more closely align inventory levels with the decline in segment sales volumes 
during fiscal  no business acquisitions were consummated although payments totaling  were made as required under the terms of a contingent payment arrangement associated with a business acquired in fiscal the single largest purpose of cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal was for business acquisitions 
two such acquisitions  both in the specialty foods segment  were made that required an aggregate expenditure of  net of cash acquired 
other cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures totaling  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal financing activities of the company used net cash totaling   and  in fiscals  and respectively 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
in may  the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares of which approximately  remained authorized for future purchase as of june  total dividend payments for were  which was nearly greater than the total of  this increase reflects the higher dividend payout rate of 
present during as compared to 
during and 
in fiscal fiscal marks the th consecutive year in which the company s dividend rate was increased 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of the company s board of directors and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
the company s ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
the company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities 
additionally  the company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
impact of inflation raw material costs were generally stable or declining during fiscal with the non food segments receiving some benefit 
energy costs  a significant input to glassware production  abated from the record high costs incurred in fiscal but remained at levels above that experienced historically 
the company generally attempts to adjust its selling prices to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments have historically been difficult to implement 
if implemented  such adjustments tend to lag the increase in costs incurred 
minimizing the exposure to such increased costs is the company s diversity of operations and its ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs and self insurance reserves 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while a summary of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this form k  management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition customer sales are recognized when revenue is realized and earned 
the company recognizes revenue when the risk and title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of its trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  the company also evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for customer deductions 
various factors such as unanticipated changes in the economy or financial well being of customers may significantly impact the needed levels of these allowances 
valuation of inventory when necessary  the company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for the company s products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of its products 
in addition  the company s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the number of stock keeping units 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact the company s evaluation of its excess and obsolete inventories 
the valuation during interim periods of inventories determined under the lifo method of accounting requires estimations regarding the year end mix of inventory quantities and costs of product 
such estimates may differ from the actual due to such factors as changes in customer demand and production schedules 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers which reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to the company s products 
additionally  the company often incurs various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
the company provides accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
the preparation of all consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between the company s estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
