item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described more fully below at business environment  most of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase boats repossessed by the lenders if the dealer defaults under his credit arrangement 
the balance of shipments was cod or payment prior to shipment  in which case  the company has no repurchase liability 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a sale are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title has passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the sales program terms 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
at june    and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june    and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
this liability amounted to approximately  and  at june  and  respectively 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat 
business environment 
fiscal presented the company with an assortment of difficult challenges 
indicators early in the year led management to expect a complicated sales scenario for the fiscal period 
other challenges faced the company in the form of an aging dealer inventory and a sales mix that obliged the company to build a heavier percentage of fish boats than ever before 
fiscal year sales were down from fiscal over  from  to  in fiscal the company made the decision to assist its dealers in retailing their aged inventory  issuing over  in special discounts  approximately of the fiscal decrease 
dealer inventory levels were monitored and managed with the company ending the year at a dealer inventory level that was the lowest of the last six years  costing the company during the fiscal year  but setting the stage for fiscal new product sales 
during the year  the company completed the tooling and design of their two newest models in the wide beam line  the wide beam fish boat and the wide beam cruiser 
these units were first introduced into the market in february at the miami international boat show 
these two lines were well accepted by the market 
since their introduction in february  sales of these two models accounted for approximately of annual sales 
sales from the new lines introduced in the miami show sold strong during the year  with the wide beam fish and the wide beam cruiser generating over of the fiscal total sales 
the sales mix was perhaps the biggest challenge 
while the new larger fish boats show profitable margins  the previously existing fishboat models tended toward a very small profit for the company 
ending the year with total mix at almost fish boats in an overall low volume fiscal year  the company faced significant difficulties operating with low gross margins from their sales 
no boats were repurchased in fiscal   and in connection with floor plan arrangements 
at june    and  the company had recorded a  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
the company also completed refinancing its long term debt in november total proceeds from the note were  which was used to payoff an existing note  to provide working capital  and to complete the cruiser tooling projects 
for the coming year  fiscal  the company has established a management team from its top level  senior managers 
this team has launched the year with a plan for significant improvement 
the plan requires strict administration of cost savings and expense cuts  but a new sales strategy provides the essential basis for the plan s success  hence a profitable and successful fiscal results of operations 
fiscal net loss for the company was  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of  or 
per share for fiscal the discounts issued to move aging dealer inventory  the low sales volume and poor sales mix resulted in the fiscal loss 
operating losses increased to  from  fiscal the reduction in income was driven by the market decline  and a less favorable sales mix as shipments of smaller fish boats  which are lower margin  proved strong during the year 
overhead expenses increased slightly as a percent of sales  a result of the drop in the volume level required to cover fixed factory overhead 
this volume decrease is reflected in the decline in gross margins from in to in fiscal depreciation expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal depreciation expense by asset category was as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal land improvements    buildings    molds plugs    machinery equipment    furniture fixtures    transportation equipment    racing equipment  total    following is a schedule of the net fixed asset additions deletions during fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal buildings  land and improvements  molds and plugs   construction in progress   machinery equipment   furniture fixtures  transportation equipment   racing equipment  total   overall selling and administrative expenses were reduced by  in fiscal from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  after additional expense of  for impairment of long lived assets in fiscal selling expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal the company continued its product promotions in fiscal  with focus on the new cruiser and wide beam models 
the company also maintained a presence in the offshore racing circuit and tournament fishing programs  but significantly reducing its expenditures relative to the prior year 
more customers are racing fountain boats under their own sponsorship while still maintaining the company s leadership position 
major selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal fishing racing    advertising    salaries commissions    boat shows    dealer incentives    other selling expenses    total    general and administrative expenses include the executive  finance  personnel  information technology  legal and administrative operating expenses of the company 
these expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment loss and wrote down certain long lived assets to realizable values 
for fiscal  the company received  in other income and there was a gain of  on the disposal of assets 
for fiscal  the company recorded a gain of  on insurance claims related to final insurance settlement from hurricane damages 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal interest expense increased slightly in fiscal primarily from the new long term debt amortization 
based upon the company experiencing consecutive operating losses  the company established a valuation allowance of approximately  against deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent  in part  upon the tax laws in effect  the company s future earnings  and other future events  the effects of which cannot be determined 
management recognizes that these net operating loss carryforwards will be available to offset future taxable income upon their return to profitability 
liquidity and financial resources 
net cash used by operations in fiscal amounted to 
net loss plus adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used by operating activities including depreciation expense of  and an impairment on the long lived assets of  and other non cash transactions used  before other changes in assets and liability accounts

the net decrease in cash for fiscal was  primarily due to the repayment of long term debt  and the investment in equipment and molds 
the net decrease in cash for fiscal was  primarily due to the investment in facilities  equipment  and molds 
the company has implemented an aggressive budget for fiscal that they believe will result in significant improvement in sales and yield improved net results during the year and at their year end 
effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material
