the program offers bsps the opportunity to co brand ultipro and to price their offerings on a per employee per month basis 
on march   ultimate software signed a co branding agreement the march agreement with ceridian corporation ceridian and on august  and february   ultimate software and ceridian amended the march agreement the amendments  together with the march agreement  the ceridian agreement 
pursuant to the ceridian agreement  ultimate software granted ceridian a non exclusive license to use ultipro software as part of an on line offering which ceridian intends to market primarily to businesses with under employees 
on march   ceridian completed an up front payment to ultimate software of million the initial payment

under the terms of the march agreement  million of the initial payment would have been refundable to ceridian if the company was unable to complete a successful transfer of technology to ceridian the technical transfer 
under the terms of the amendments  ceridian agreed that technical transfer occurred on february  the total amount paid to ultimate software of million from both the initial payment and the prepayment the total payment is not subject to refund 
in addition  under the terms of the ceridian agreement  as a result of the achievement of technical transfer  ceridian is obligated to pay a monthly license fee based on the number of employees paid using the ultimate software product 
these payments are subject to a minimum monthly payment of  per month beginning in january with annual increases beginning in under the amendments  the minimum payments of  per month  which would have been payable in by ceridian pursuant to the march agreement  were waived

under the terms of the evolution release agreement  ceridian will pay ultimate software  in the event the evolution release is delivered by august  to the extent ultimate software delivers evolution to ceridian beyond september   ultimate software is obligated to pay ceridian  per month up to a maximum of million the evolution obligation  with a daily pro ration of the obligation to be applied to the extent the delivery occurs during one of the three months of october  november and december the company believes that it will deliver evolution to ceridian before september  for accounting purposes  the initial payment is included in deferred revenue as of december  the prepayment received in february is included in deferred revenue for financial reporting purposes 
because technical transfer has occurred  the minimum payments guaranteed to the company  less the portion attributable to maintenance revenue for the period prior to technical transfer and less the evolution obligation  will be recognized ratably as subscription revenue totaling approximately  per month from the date of technical transfer  february   through the end of the minimum term

stock repurchases may be made periodically in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or a combination of both 
the extent and timing of these transactions will depend on market conditions and other business considerations

in accordance with the ceridian agreement  as previously discussed  on march   ceridian completed an up front payment to ultimate software of million the initial payment 
on february   ceridian completed a prepayment of royalties payable to ultimate software of million in accordance with the terms of the amendments the prepayment 
under the terms of the march agreement  million of the initial payment would have been refundable to ceridian if the company was unable to complete a successful transfer of technology to ceridian the technical transfer 
under the terms of the amendments  ceridian agreed that technical transfer occurred on february  the total amount paid to ultimate software of million from both the initial payment and the prepayment the total payment is not subject to refund 
in addition  under the terms of the ceridian agreement  as a result of the achievement of technical transfer  ceridian is obligated to pay a monthly license fee based on the number of employees paid using the ultimate software product 
these payments are subject to a minimum monthly payment of  per month beginning in january with annual increases beginning in under the amendments  the minimum payments of  per month  which would have been payable in by ceridian pursuant to the march agreement  were waived

the parties expect the minimum term of the agreement to be years the minimum term 
the aggregate of the total payment and the minimum monthly amounts which ceridian is obligated to pay to ultimate software during the minimum term is approximately million 
the ceridian agreement includes the provision of future updates to ultipro which is a standard contract provision for the company s software products 
on february   ultimate software signed an agreement with ceridian for the delivery of a release generally known by the parties as evolution the evolution release agreement 
under the terms of the evolution release agreement  ceridian will pay ultimate software  in the event the evolution release is delivered by august  to the extent ultimate software delivers evolution to ceridian beyond september   ultimate software is obligated to pay ceridian  per month up to a maximum of million the evolution obligation  with a daily pro ration of the obligation to be applied to the extent the delivery occurs during one of those the months of october  november and december the company believes that it will deliver evolution to ceridian before september  ceridian may acquire an equity interest in ultimate through purchases in the open market or from third parties  subject to a contractual limitation of of the company s common stock 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
quarterly fluctuations the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  increased expenses especially as they relate to product development and sales and marketing  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of revenues  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and capital spending patterns of the company s customers 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based upon its expectations as to future revenues  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
a drop in near term demand for the company s products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
profitability achieved in previous fiscal quarters is not necessarily indicative of operating results for the full fiscal years or for any future periods 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
the company believes that  due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations  period to period comparisons of its operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
