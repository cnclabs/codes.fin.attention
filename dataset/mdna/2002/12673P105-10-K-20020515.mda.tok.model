critical accounting policies and business practices note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that are used by the company 
many of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
critical accounting estimates  which are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and which require complex  subjective judgments  are as follows basis of revenue recognition in october  the company announced a shift to its new business model  offering customers the flexibility and freedom to adapt to rapidly changing enterprise requirements while reducing the risks and costs associated with traditional software licensing models 
under the new business model  customers can determine the length and dollar value of their software licenses 
the new business model provides customers with the flexibility to subscribe to software under month to month licenses or choose cost certainty by committing to a longer term arrangement 
the new business model also permits customers to vary their software mix as their business and technology needs change  including the right to receive unspecified future software within designated product lines 
the company believes the new business model improves the visibility and predictability of the company s revenue streams by recognizing license revenue on a ratable basis rather than on an up front one time basis as the company did prior to the quarter ended december  the terms of these new arrangements are structured such that product revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license on a monthly basis which has impacted the company s reported revenue on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis 
the portion of the license arrangement that is not recognized as revenue creates deferred subscription revenue which will be recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the arrangement 
prior to the introduction of the new business model  maintenance revenue was bundled for a portion of the term of the license arrangement 
under these arrangements  the maintenance  which was based on optional annual renewal rates stated in the arrangement  initially was deferred and subsequently amortized into revenue over the initial contractual term of the arrangement 
maintenance renewals have been recognized ratably over the term of the renewal arrangement 
for arrangements executed under the new business model  maintenance is bundled for the entire term of the license arrangement 
under these arrangements  maintenance revenue is recognized ratably as subscription revenue over the term of the license arrangement  along with the license fee  commencing upon delivery of the currently available software products 
financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the company s old business model and the subsequent increase of receivables to the amount due and payable by customers 
financing fees will continue to decrease as they are amortized over the arrangement term 
accounts receivable as detailed in the table included in note to the consolidated financial statements  at march   net accounts receivable  after accounting for unearned revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts  is billion 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable that has been recognized as revenue  which the company does not expect to collect 
the company performs a quarterly analysis to determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
this analysis includes various analytical procedures and a review of factors  including specific individual balances selected from a cross section of the accounts that comprise total accounts receivable  the company s history of collections of long term contracts  as well as the overall economic environment 
the company s ability to collect its accounts receivable is dependent upon a number of factors including the performance of its products  customer satisfaction with ongoing services  financial condition of customers and general economic conditions 
changes to these factors will influence the amount of the required al lowance 
the company expects the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the old business model are billed and collected over the remaining life 
deferred tax assets the company has recognized for financial statement purposes a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations 
this recognition assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that the carryforward of these losses will be realized 
the factors that the company considers in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are primarily made up of acquisition liabilities  such as duplicate facility  employee severance and other costs  and foreign net operating losses nols 
the nols generally expire between and a valuation allowance was established in the year ended march  for certain foreign deferred tax assets the company believes may not be realized 
adjustments to the val uation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the amount of nols realized is greater or less than the amount recorded 
valuation of intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired by the company in purchase business combinations 
the company has historically amortized goodwill using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of to years 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas effective april  upon adoption  the company stopped the amortization of goodwill with an estimated net carrying value of approximately billion at march  the company is having an independent valuation analysis completed and does not anticipate any material transitional impairment  however  future impairment reviews may result in periodic write downs as a result of changes in the valuation analysis 
the valuation is based upon the company s forecast of operating results for the entity that has recorded goodwill  as well as estimates of fair value of the entity and its tangible and intangible assets 
the carrying values of purchased software products and other intangible assets are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment  which includes an assessment of the net realizable value of capitalized software costs as of the balance sheet date 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on net realizable value for capitalized software and fair value for all other intangibles 
results of operations the company distributes and markets its software solutions directly to the end user as well as to distribution partners  resellers or vars 
the company derives revenues from the following sources license fees the licensing of the company s solutions on a right to use basis  maintenance fees the providing of post contract customer support and enhancements  and service fees the providing of professional services such as implementation  consulting and education services 
the timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined by the nature of the contractual provisions  such as the term of the arrangement  included in the arrangements with customers 
in fiscal year  the average contract life approximated three and a half years  with a company goal of further reducing it to three years 
prior to december  the company s software license arrangements included contractual provisions that resulted in the recognition of license fee revenue up front  upon delivery of the attributable software products  assuming the three other prerequisite criteria to recognize revenue were met pursuant to the provisions of aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
the arrangement fee was fixed or determinable  collectibility of the fee was probable and persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed 
beginning in december  the company s software license arrangements have included contractual provisions that  among other things  allow the customer to receive unspecified future software products within designated product lines 
under these arrangements  the company begins to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the licens e arrangement after meeting the four revenue recognition criteria as noted above 
as was the case prior to december  maintenance is recognized ratably over the contract term and professional service fees are generally recognized as the services are performed 
the new business model improves the visibility of the company s revenue streams since license fees are recognized ratably  rather than on an up front one time basis 
to enhance comparability  during the transition to the new business model  the company has supplemented the md a with pro forma financial information for the current and prior fiscal year 
fiscal year total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  or billion  over fiscal year excluding an approximately million decline attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rate movements with the us dollar  revenue decreased billion to billion 
the decrease was primarily due to the company s transition to the new business model during the third quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a decrease in up front license fees compared to the prior year period  partially offset by new subscription revenue 
in addition  apprehension toward capital spending by the company s existing and potential customers due to weaker conditions in the overall economy and the technology industry also impacted fiscal year revenue 
the company does not expect an improvement in capital spending by customers until there is an improvement in economic and industry condit ions 
during fiscal year  approximately billion was recognized as revenue up front at contract signing under the company s old business model and was included in the software fees and other line item on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in fiscal year the total revenue decrease is also attributable to a decline in professional services revenue of million 
although the transition to the new business model and weaker economic conditions contributed to the revenue decrease  quantification of the impact these components had on such decrease is not readily determinable 
the company s new business model will improve the visibility of the company s revenue streams since license fees will be recognized ratably  rather than on an up front one time basis 
to enhance comparability at the outset of the transition to the new business model  the company has supplemented the md a with pro forma financial information for the current and prior fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended march   subscription revenue totaled million  an increase of million over the prior fiscal year 
these fees represent the ratable revenue recognized on contracts executed under the new business model 
the increase is a result of the execution of these types of contracts for all of fiscal year  whereas these contracts were only executed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year software fees and other decreased billion  or  from the comparable prior year period due to the transition to license arrangements under the new business model  in which revenue is recognized ratably and is included as subscription revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  compared with recognizing revenue up front at contract signing as was the case through the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year the remaining items that comprise software fees and other are primarily revenue associated with sales to distributors  resellers and vars  which are generally recognized when the reseller  distributor or var sells the software products to its customers 
in fiscal year  maintenance revenue decreased  or million  from the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to agreements executed under the new business model which include maintenance revenue that is bundled with license revenue and  together  the maintenance and license revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and included as a component of subscription revenue 
maintenance revenue will continue to decrease as deferred maintenance revenue under the company s old business model is amortized over the contract term  partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect to continue to receive optional maintenance at the expiration of the original contract term of their agreements 
for the fiscal year ended march   financing fees decreased  or million  from the prior year 
financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the company s old business model and the subsequent increase of receivables to the amount due and payable by customers 
the decrease was due to the discontinuance of the offering of contracts which were recorded under the old business model 
financing fees will continue to decrease as they are amortized over the contract life 
in fiscal year  professional services revenue decreased  or million  from the prior year  primarily as a result of the company s shift in focus to professional services engagements that are centered around the company s products 
the decrease is also attributable to the company s divestiture in october of sterling s federal systems group fsg  a provider of professional services to governmental agencies  which contributed approximately million to professional services revenue in fiscal year revenue in the united states represented of overall revenue for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year consistent with and for the same reasons as the overall decrease in revenue  international revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year price changes did not have a material impact in fiscal year or in fiscal year cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel related costs to provide professional services and training to customers 
cost of professional services decreased million  or  due primarily to a reduction in professional services revenue and related personnel from fiscal year to fiscal year  including the divesture of fsg  which contributed approximately million of such expenses in the prior year 
in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  or million  from the prior year to billion 
the decrease was largely attributable to the company s emphasis on overall cost control measures  including personnel related costs such as reduced travel expenses in connection with a reduction in the company s headcount of approximately  employees over the prior fiscal year period 
excluding a charge related to an impairment of assets sold in april of approximately million in fiscal year and a charge associated with the bankruptcy of inacom corporation of approximately million in fiscal year  sg a decreased  or million 
product development and enhancement expenses consists primarily of personnel costs  which decreased million  or  for fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was a result of general cost containment primarily related to personnel costs 
the company continued its focus on product development and enhancements  with an emphasis on adapting and enhancing products within the company s six focus areas  particularly for the distributed processing and ibm s z os environments  as well as a broadening of the company s enterprise product offerings 
commissions and royalty expense decreased million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
commissions and royalty expense as a percentage of revenue increased due to the lower revenue achievement associated with the company s transition to the new business model without an associated change in the overall sales compensation 
the decrease in commissions and royalty expense was principally the result of a decline in contract bookings associated with the weaker economic environment for information technology spending 
depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles expense in fiscal year decreased million over the prior year 
amortization of capitalized software costs in fiscal year decreased million over the prior year 
the decrease of depreciation and amortization of goodwill and capitalized software costs was a result of scheduled reductions in the amortization of intangible assets associated with past acquisitions 
sfas will have the effect of substantially reducing the company s amortization of goodwill and intangibles commencing april  net interest expense decreased million compared with the prior year  consisting of a million reduction due to a decrease in the average variable interest rate and a million reduction due to a decrease in average debt outstanding 
the pre tax loss of billion for fiscal year exceeds the fiscal year loss by million 
excluding the million asset impairment charge  the pre tax loss would have been billion  compared with pre tax loss of million in fiscal year  excluding a special gain of million related to the settlement of the stock plan litigation and a special charge of million related to the bankruptcy filing of inacom corporation 
net loss for the year ended march  was billion  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year fiscal net loss  excluding the after tax aforementioned impairment charge  was billion  an increased loss of million over the prior year s net loss  exclusive of the aforementioned special items 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate  excluding acquisition amortization  was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
fiscal year total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  or billion  over fiscal year excluding an approximately million decline attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rate movements with the us dollar  revenue decreased billion to billion 
total revenue was unfavorably impacted in the second half of the fiscal year due to the introduction of the new business model whereby license fee revenue for such arrangements is now recognized ratably over the contract term 
additionally  the company experienced weakness in the first half of the fiscal year as a result of customers deferring purchases ahead of an ibm hardware cycle 
although weaker economic conditions and the transition to the new business model contributed to the revenue decrease  quantification of the impact these components had on such decrease is not readily determinable 
for the fiscal year ended march   subscription revenue totaled million 
these fees represent the ratable revenue recognized on contracts executed under the new business model 
the remainder of the license and maintenance fees payable on such license arrangements will amortize into revenue over the respective license arrangement s term 
software fees and other decreased billion  or  from the comparable prior year period due to the transition to license arrangements under the new business model 
for the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded billion under the old business model 
the remaining items that comprise software fees and other is primarily revenue associated with sales to distributors  resellers and vars in which revenue is generally recognized when the reseller  distributor or var sells the software products to its customers 
in fiscal year  maintenance revenue increased  or million  to billion from the prior year primarily as a result of acquired companies products  partially offset by a decrease associated with revenue recorded since the introduction of the new business model 
maintenance will continue to decrease as deferred maintenance under the old business model is amortized over the contract term 
for the fiscal year ended march   financing fees increased  or million  to million from the prior year  as a result of an increase in installment based licenses and the associated non current receivables prior to the introduction of the new business model 
under the old business model  financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms and the subsequent increase to receivables to the amount due and payable by customers 
this accretion of financing fees on the unpaid receivables due in future years represent financing fees 
in fiscal year  professional services increased  or million  to million from the prior year  as a result of the acquisition of sterling in march  partially offset by the company s refocusing of its service operations on engagements involving the company s products 
such refocusing has unfavorably impacted professional services revenue 
reflecting the strategy to focus the professional services organization on the deployment of ca solutions  the company divested fsg in the third quarter of fiscal year revenue in the united states represented of overall revenue for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year consistent with the overall decrease in revenue  international revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year price changes did not have a material impact in fiscal year or in fiscal year cost of professional services  which consists primarily of personnel related costs to provide professional services and training to customers  increased million  or  which is similar to the increase in professional services revenue from fiscal year to fiscal year in fiscal year  sg a  excluding the charge associated with the bankruptcy of inacom corporation of approximately million  increased from the prior year to billion  exclusive of the charge of approximately million in fiscal year associated with the write off of the company s investment in chs electronics  inc chs

product development and enhancement expenses increased million  or  for fiscal year compared with the prior year

depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles expense in fiscal year increased million over the prior year 
amortization of capitalized software costs in fiscal year increased million over the prior year 
the increase in depreciation and both amortization of goodwill and capitalized software costs was primarily due to the additional amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles associated with sterling  marginally offset by the scheduled reductions in the amortization of costs associated with past acquisitions 
net interest expense increased million compared with the prior year 
the increase consisted of a million increase due to an increase in the average variable interest rate and a million decrease due to a decrease in average debt outstanding

see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
total pro forma revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was billion  an increase of  or million  over the prior year pro forma revenue of billion 
the increase was attributable to the ratable recognition of revenue on contracts transacted during the prior fiscal year  partially offset by a reduction in professional services revenue million  which was primarily the result of the divestiture of fsg in the third quarter of fiscal year  which generated million of revenue in that fiscal year and the company s decision to reduce professional services associated with non ca products 
north america and international pro forma revenue represented and  respectively  of overall pro forma revenue in both fiscal years and the international pro forma revenue was unfavorably impacted by the effect of exchange rates on the us dollar versus foreign currencies 
on a pro forma basis  pre tax income excluding acquisition amortization and special charges was billion for fiscal year  an increase of  or million  over prior year s pre tax income of billion  exclusive of acquisition amortization and special items 
pro forma net income  excluding acquisition amortization and special items  was billion for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million  or  over fiscal year the increase was largely attributable to the company s emphasis on overall cost control measures related to a reduction in the company s headcount of approximately  over the prior fiscal year 
the company s consolidated annual effective tax rate  excluding acquisition amortization and special items  was assumed to be for both fiscal years and in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired sterling in a stock for stock exchange valued at approximately billion 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired platinum for approximately billion in cash and assumed liabilities 
acquired in process research and development ipr d charges relate to acquisitions of software companies accounted for under the purchase method  in which a portion of the purchase price is allocated to acquired in process technology and is expensed immediately since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects has not yet been achieved and is believed to have no alternative future use 
independent valuations of sterling and platinum  using the income approach  were performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and in allocating the purchase price among the acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to ipr d  which was million and million for sterling and platinum  respectively 
this approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset  which was determined through review of data provided by both the acquired companies and independent sources and through analysis of relevant market sizes  growth factors and expected trends in technology 
the steps followed in applying this approach included estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a rate of return commensurate with the relative risk levels 
the ongoing development projects at sterling at the time of the purchase were composed primarily of application development and information management  business intelligence  network management and storage management tools and solutions 
the acquired projects included add on features  tools and next generation versions of cool  vision  eureka  sams and solve product families 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and the remaining development effort would take approximately months to complete  with a cost of approximately million 
approximately million and million were incurred during the years ended march  and  respectively  on the sterling related projects and no additional amounts are expected to be incurred relative to these projects 
products from each of the aforemention ed projects are currently commercially available under the sterling product family or the company s rebranded product names 
the ongoing development projects at platinum at the time of the purchase were composed primarily of application development  database and enterprise management tools and data warehousing solutions 
the acquired projects included add on features  tools and next generation versions of db solutions  provision  security  advantage application development  end to end data warehousing  and internet infrastructure product families 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and the remaining development effort would take approximately months to complete  with a cost of approximately million 
approximately million  million and million were incurred during the years ended march   and  respectively  on the platinum related projects and no additional amounts are expected to be incurred relative to these projec ts 
products from each of the aforementioned projects are currently commercially available under the platinum product family or the company s rebranded product names 
in order for the company to succeed in the highly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace in which it operates  it has been the company s philosophy to continue to develop  as well as integrate  acquired projects into its solutions 
the company is committed to both the sterling and platinum product lines and continues to invest in the development  enhancement and integration of the acquired projects 
in addition  the company does not specifically track revenue generated from completed ipr d projects subsequent to the closing and integration of acquisitions 
if these projects do not continue to be successfully developed  supported and marketed  the revenue and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
results will also be subject to uncertain market events and risks that are beyond the company s control  such as trends in technology  government regulations  market size and growth and product introduction by competitors 
management believes that the assumptions used in the purchased ipr d valuation reasonably estimate the future benefits 
there can be no assurances that in future periods actual results will not deviate from current estimates

risk factors current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below 
any of these factors  or others  many of which are beyond the company s control  could negatively affect the company s revenue  profitability or cash flow in the future 
operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors 
quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors  including those listed below  which in turn could adversely affect the company s revenue  profitability or cash flow in the future 
these factors include demand for products and services  length of sales cycle  customer implementation of the company s products  magnitude of price and product competition  introduction of new hardware  general economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business  customer budgets for hardware and software  ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ability to control costs  the size of licensing transactions  ability to retain qualified personnel  and reaction of customers to the new business model 
any of the foregoing factors may cause the company s operating expenses to be disproportionately high or cause its revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
as a consequence  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
the computer software business is highly competitive 
the market in which the company competes is marked by rapid and substantial technological change  the steady emergence of new companies and products  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and continue to enhance existing products 
the company may be unsuccessful in its ability to develop new releases or new products that meet the needs of its customers in light of competitive alternatives available in the market 
in addition  the introduction of new products or versions of existing products may not meet with customer acceptance or may be delayed 
the company s inability to bring new products and enhancements to existing products to the market in a timely manner or the failure for these products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
the software business is marked by easy entry and large  entrenched businesses 
many companies with whom the company competes  including ibm  sun  hp and other large computer manufacturers  have substantial resources  a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche  as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by the company 
competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry 
some  like microsoft  oracle corporation and sap ag  are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets 
in addition  new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis  offering products that compete with those offered by the company 
increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry 
additionally  many customers historically have developed thei r own solutions that compete with those offered by the company 
competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions  or displacement of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments 
ibm  hp  sun and microsoft are by far the largest suppliers of systems software and  in most cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of the company s customers 
historically  these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  systems software and computer hardware 
such new products could in the future incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by the company s products or could require substantial modification of the company s products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although the company has to date been able to adapt its products and its business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt the company s products in a timely manner to such changes or customer d ecisions to forego the use of the company s products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  and object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as the company were able to develop and market compatible software 
ibm and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on the company 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research an d development costs for the company in connection with the enhancement and modification of the company s existing products and the development of new products 
although the company does not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
third party microcode could impact product development 
the company anticipates ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers 
microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are therefore less flexible than other types of software 
the company believes that such continued use will not have a significant impact on the company s operations and that its products will remain compatible with any changes to such code 
however  there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions 
the company s products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of its customers information processing resources 
in a recessionary environment  the company s products are often a reasonable economic alternative for customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources 
however  a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments and this could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property rights would weaken its competitive position 
future success of the company is dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company protects its proprietary information through the use of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
notwithstanding the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use or copying of its proprietary information is difficult 
unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources 
moreover  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to the company s proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
for example  shrink wrap or click on licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in addition  patents the company has obt ained may be circumvented  challenged  invalidated or designed around by other companies 
the company s inability to adequately protect its intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect its business  financial condition and operating results 
the markets for some or all the company s key product areas may not continue to grow 
the company has identified six product focus areas enterprise management  security  storage  portal and business intelligence  application life cycle management and data management and application development 
some or all of these areas may not continue to grow  may not grow at their current rates  may decline in growth or customers may decline or forego use of products in some or all of these focal areas 
this is particularly true in newly emerging areas  such as portal and business intelligence 
a decline in these focus areas could result in decreased demand for the company s products  which would adversely impact its business  financial condition and operating results 
certain software is licensed from third parties 
some of the company s products contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to the company in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow its products to remain competitive 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products 
this could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
customers are still adapting to the company s new business model 
the company s new business model affords customers greater flexibility in licensing transactions 
for example  under the new business model  the company licenses software on a month to month or other short term basis in order to allow customers the opportunity to try the company s software solutions without committing to a multi year license obligation 
transactions such as these increase the risk that customers will not fully implement the company s software and will not enter into a long term relationship with the company 
this could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
this effect could be diminished if customers elect cost certainty by committing to longer contract periods 
third parties could claim that the company s products infringe their intellectual property rights 
from time to time the company receives notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property 
investigation of these claims  whether with or without merit  can be expensive and could affect development  marketing or shipment of the company s products 
as the number of software patents issued increases  it is likely that additional claims  with or without merit  will be asserted 
defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
changes to compensation of the company s sales organization 
the company revised its compensation plan for the sales organization effective april  the new compensation plan is in alignment with the new business model objectives of providing customer flexibility and satisfaction 
the compensation plan may encourage behavior not anticipated or intended as it is implemented  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the success of the company s international operations is subject to many factors 
international revenue has historically represented approximately one third of the company s total worldwide revenue 
continued success in selling the company s products outside of the united states depends on a variety of factors  including the following reorganizations of the sales force  fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates  staffing key managerial positions  general economic conditions in foreign countries  political instability  and trade restrictions such as tariffs  duties or other controls affecting foreign operations 
increase in tariffs  the imposition of trade restrictions or other factors may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses 
most of the revenue and expenses of the company s foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  it is not possible to predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company s future operating results 
given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of the company s products  foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions 
additionally  deterioration of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect the company s ability to increase its revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company could be subject to fines  penalties or other sanctions as a result of a joint inquiry by the sec and us attorney s office 
since february  the company has been cooperating with a joint inquiry by the staff of the northeast regional office of the securities and exchange commission and the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york concerning certain of the company s accounting practices 
see item legal proceedings 
although the company is unable at this point to predict the scope or outcome of this inquiry  it is possible that it could result in the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  and or other remedies and sanctions 
the conduct of these proceedings could negatively impact the company s stock price 
in addition  the company expects to continue to incur expenses associated with responding to these agencies  regardless of the outcome and this may divert the efforts and attention of the company s management team from no rmal business operations 
the company may become dependent upon large transactions 
the company has historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers 
as a result of the flexibility afforded by the new business model  the company anticipates that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect the company s business  financial conditions and operating results 
a large portion of business is consummated at the end of each quarter 
historically  a significant percentage of the company s quarterly transactions are finalized in the last few days of the quarter  which may impact financial performance 
one of the intended benefits the company anticipates from the new business model will be a more predictable revenue stream throughout the quarter 
even as customers continue to transition to the new business model  it is still likely that a large number of transactions will be consummated in the last few days of the quarter  with the risk that some of these may not become final 
failure to finalize transactions in the last few days of the quarter could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
growth depends upon successful integration of acquisitions 
the company s growth strategy is based upon internal development of technology  selective acquisitions and integration of such acquisitions into ongoing operations 
implementation of this growth strategy may result in strains on the company s management team  internal systems and financial resources 
difficulties encountered in successfully integrating acquired companies and products may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company has a significant amount of debt 
as of march   the company had approximately billion of debt outstanding consisting of bank credit lines  unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations  convertible senior notes  commercial paper and unsecured multi currency credit facilities 
the company expects that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  expected cash provided from operations and the anticipated renewal of bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
failure to generate sufficient cash as the debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further 
in march  moody s investors service downgraded the company s senior unsecured long term debt rating and shifted its rating outlook on the company from stable to negative 
in addition  in february standard poor s revised its rating outlook on the company from stable to negative 
the company cannot assure investors that moody s  standard poor s or any other rating agency will not further downgrade the company s credit ratings in the future 
if the company s credit ratings are downgraded  it could be required to  among other things  pay additional interest under its credit agreements or other debt 
any such downgrades could also affect the ability of the company to obtain additional financing in the future and will affect the terms of any such financing 
the company s stock price may continue to be volatile 
the company s stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant contracts  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or the company s competitors  changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions  general conditions in the software and computer industries and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to the company s and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
acts of terrorism or war may adversely affect the company s business 
acts of terrorism  acts of war and other unforeseen events  may cause damage or disruption to the company s properties  business  employees  suppliers  distributors  resellers and customers  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  debt payable and installment accounts receivable 
the company has a prescribed methodology whereby it invests its excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers standard poor s single a rating and higher 
to mitigate risk  many of the securities have a maturity date within one year  and holdings of any one issuer excluding the us government do not exceed of the portfolio 
periodically  the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments 
the company maintains a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of march   the company s outstanding debt approximated billion  with approximately billion in fixed rate obligations 
if market rates were to decline  the company could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximately million annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of march  the company offers financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with its software solution sales 
the aggregate contract value under the old business model includes an imputed interest element  which can vary with the interest rate environment 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk the company conducts business on a worldwide basis through branches and subsidiaries in countries 
the company is therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates 
as part of its risk management strategy and consistent with prior years  the company did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions 
in addition  the company manages its level of exposure by denominating international sales and payments of related expense in the local currency of its subsidiaries 
a decline in all foreign currencies against the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on the company s net loss income 
equity price risk the company has minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
as of march   these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for the company to make investments in equity securities as part of its investment strategy
