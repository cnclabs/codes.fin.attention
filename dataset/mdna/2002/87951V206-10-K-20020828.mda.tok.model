overview teletouch is a leading provider of wireless telecommunications services  primarily paging services  in non major metropolitan areas and communities in the southeast united states 
as of may   the company had approximately  pagers in service 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed  periodic fees without incurring additional selling expenses or other fixed costs 
due to growth resulting from the completion of acquisitions in certain prior years  teletouch s results of operations for prior periods may not be indicative of future performance 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon teletouch s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  teletouch evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets  reserves for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition and certain accrued liabilities 
teletouch bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of teletouch evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets and certain intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  teletouch must project estimated cash flows which are based on various operating assumptions such as average revenue per unit in service  disconnect rates  sales productivity ratios and expenses 
management develops these cash flow projections on a periodic basis and reviews the projections based on actual operating trends 
the projections assume that general economic conditions will continue unchanged throughout the projection period and that their potential impact on capital spending and revenues will not fluctuate 
projected revenues are based on the company s estimate of units in service and average revenue per unit  as well as revenue from various new product initiatives 
projected revenues assume a continued decline in traditional messaging units in service throughout the projection period  which is partially offset by growth of advanced messaging units in service and revenue from the new product initiatives 
projected operating expenses are based upon historic experience and expected market conditions adjusted to reflect an expected decrease in expenses resulting from cost saving initiatives 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the remaining net book value of its long lived assets was substantially impaired and the recovery of such amounts through future operations or disposition was unlikely 
accordingly  management estimated the future discounted cash flows and determined the goodwill and fcc licenses were significantly impaired and therefore recorded a charge equal to the remaining net book value of these assets of million 
teletouch s review of the carrying value of its long lived assets at may  indicates that the carrying value of these assets is recoverable through future estimated cash flows 
if the cash flow estimates  or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based  change in the future  teletouch may be required to record additional impairment charges related to its long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the reserve for doubtful accounts and are based on historic collection experience  current trends and a percentage of the accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining these percentages teletouch reviews historical write offs  including comparisons of write offs to provisions for doubtful accounts and as a percentage of revenues  teletouch compares the ratio of the reserve to gross receivables to historic levels and teletouch monitors collections amounts and statistics 
teletouch s allowance for doubtful accounts was million at may  while write offs of customer accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that teletouch will continue to experience the same write off rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the reserve for doubtful accounts and related provisions for write offs 
reserve for inventory obsolescence estimates are used in determining the reserve for inventory obsolescence and are based on sales trends  a ratio of inventory to revenue  and a review of specific categories of inventory 
in establishing its reserve  teletouch reviews historic inventory obsolescence experience including comparisons of previous write offs to provision for inventory obsolescence and the inventory count compared to recent sales trends 
teletouch s reserve for inventory obsolescence was million at may  while inventory obsolescence has historically been within our expectations and the provision established  management cannot guarantee that teletouch will continue to experience the same obsolescence rates that it has in the past which could result in material differences in the reserve for inventory obsolescence and the related inventory write offs 
revenue recognition teletouch s revenue consists primarily of monthly service and lease revenues charged to customers on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
revenue also includes sales of messaging devices  cellular telephones  and other products directly to customers and resellers 
teletouch recognizes revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
teletouch believes  relative to sales of one way messaging equipment  that all of these conditions are met  and since service is deemed not to be essential to the sale of the equipment  product revenue is recognized at the time of shipment revenue from sale of other products is recognized upon delivery

results of operations for the fiscal years ended may   and total revenue teletouch s total revenue decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the fiscal year total revenue decrease from fiscal was due to a loss of approximately million of revenues from pager sales and a loss of million in paging services revenue as a result of the continuing decline in demand for one way paging service 
the decline in revenues in fiscal year was partially offset by an increase in cellular revenues of million due to increased marketing of our cellular products 
the fiscal year total revenue decrease from fiscal was due to a loss of approximately million of revenues from pager sales and paging services due to a continuing decline in demand for one way paging service 
this decrease in revenues in fiscal year was partially offset by an increase in two way revenues of million due in part to the acquisition of eastex communications in april and to an increase in cellular revenues of million due to internal growth 
pagers in service declined to  at may  as compared to  and  at may  and respectively 
the decline in total revenue in fiscal year was unaffected by changes in average revenue per unit arpu  however  the decline in total revenue in fiscal year was compounded by a decline in arpu for that period 
arpu for the year ended may  was as compared to and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
arpu has remained flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to the company s ability to maintain the level of its highest arpu business customer base year over year while its lower arpu reseller customer base continued to decline 
these events resulted in a decrease in the percentage of the company s subscriber base represented by resellers 
the decrease in arpu for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increased competition in the company s markets and to a lesser extent to an increase in the percentage of the company s subscriber base represented by resellers 
resellers are businesses that buy airtime at wholesale prices from teletouch and sell the service to end users 
while the wholesale price to a reseller is lower than the price the company charges to its other customers  a reseller bears the cost of acquiring  billing  collecting and servicing its subscribers 
at may  approximately of the company s subscriber base was represented by resellers as opposed to at may  and at may  as competitors continue to pursue teletouch s customers in the marketplace and as the paging industry fully matures  arpu is expected to continue to decline 
teletouch expects that the introduction of new products and services will only partially offset any decline in arpu or paging subscribers and will result in a decrease in total revenue during the next year 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  and excluding impairment charges recorded in fiscal  were million  or of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to million  or of total revenue and million  or of total revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
costs decreased in fiscal over fiscal due to a decrease in bad debt expense of million resulting primarily from the decline in the company s retail paging subscriber base along with increased collections efforts  a decrease in advertising expense of million  a decrease in telephone expense of million due to savings on a new long distance contract and a decrease in payroll and commissions expense of million as a result of the reduction in number of retail stores and lower sales volume in fiscal year additionally  the company reduced third party paging service charges by million and improved its billing costs by million from fiscal year these decreases in expenses were partially offset by increases in tower rents and insurance expense totaling million combined and million in non recurring retail restructuring costs related to lease commitments and disposals of related assets during fiscal year see discussion below 
operating expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily because of new retail store openings  particularly in the areas of payroll  rent  and advertising expenses and due to non recurring charges of million associated with retail store closings 
operating costs as a percentage of total revenue have increased while the company s paging subscriber base continues to decline 
the company has a relatively fixed cost structure related to maintaining its paging network 
as paging subscribers and the related recurring revenues continue to decline  operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue will continue to increase until the company is able to generate sufficient revenue growth in its other product and service offerings 
the company expects operating expenses to decline during the next year as unprofitable products and or locations are eliminated  however  it cannot be certain that operating costs will decline in proportion to revenue 
in may  the company completed a review of the financial performance of its retail stores 
this review resulted in the completion of a retail restructuring plan that concluded the need to close of the company s locations and reduce of the remaining locations to customer service only locations 
as of may  the company had completed the closure of of its retail locations leaving locations open as of the end of fiscal locations selected for closure were not contributing to the company s operating income on a current basis 
to evaluate the financial results on a current basis  we excluded the recurring revenues from paging subscribers that were put on service in prior periods 
locations selected to be reduced to customer service only locations were also not contributing to the company s operating income  although were supporting a sizable paging subscriber base that would not be easily serviced from any other location 
the purpose of the restructuring is to reduce operating expenses while minimizing the impact on the recurring revenues from the paging subscribers that were being serviced by the effected locations 
the retail restructuring plan is to be complete by september as a result of the retail restructuring plan  the company recorded non recurring charges of  related to the remaining lease commitments and  to write off the remaining book value of the leasehold improvements related to the stores being closed 
these charges were recorded in may depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal was due primarily to the company writing off all of its intangible assets  primarily purchased goodwill and fcc licenses  by recording a charge equaling the remaining book value of these assets of million in may see footnote a in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the expiration of the amortization on these intangible assets written off in fiscal year resulted in a million decrease in amortization expense 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal was due primarily to the expiration of amortization on certain acquired intangible assets late in fiscal resulting in a million decrease in amortization expense partially offset by an increase in deprecation expense related to fixed assets used opening new retail stores in fiscal and interest expense net interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal interest expense decreased in fiscal over fiscal partly due to the successful completion of the company s debt reorganization discussed below under financial condition as well as decreases in the variable interest rates on the credit agreement 
interest expense increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increases in the variable interest rates on the credit agreement as well as increased compound interest associated with the junior subordinated notes discussed below under financial condition 
a component of the interest rate on the credit agreement was determined by the company s leverage ratio at each fiscal quarter 
during fiscal  the company operated at a leverage ratio that resulted in a variable interest rate higher than in fiscal this increase in interest expense was offset slightly by principal payments on the credit agreement totaling million in fiscal income taxes the company s net operating loss carryforwards were reduced to at may  from approximately million at may  other deferred tax assets were reduced as well 
this reduction occurred due to the attribute reduction rules of internal revenue code section related to the company s debt restructuring 
a corresponding reduction to the valuation allowance previously recorded against these assets has also been recorded 
financial condition teletouch s cash balance was million at may  as compared to million at may  cash provided by operating activities increased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year was primarily due to the company ceasing interest payments on the credit agreement in june during the continued negotiations with the lenders to reorganize this senior debt instrument 
the company was successful in restructuring its senior debt in may by paying its senior lenders an aggregate cash amount of approximately  and delivering a new promissory note to one of the original senior lenders in the amount of  discussed below under senior debt reorganization 
additionally  pursuant to the restructuring agreement dated may  by and among tll partners  gm holdings and teletouch  the two holders of the company s junior subordinate notes reached an agreement that released and discharged teletouch of its junior debt obligations without recourse 
gm holdings forgave teletouch s debt obligations totaling  including accrued interest and tll partners forgave teletouch s debt obligations totaling  the company expects that cash flow provided from operations  together with the company s existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs in fiscal as the company has succeeded in reorganizing its debt obligations as discussed in greater detail below 
teletouch s operations require capital investment to purchase pagers for lease to customers and to acquire paging infrastructure equipment to support the company s existing subscribers 
net capital expenditures  including pagers  amounted to million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to less capital spending on opening new retail stores as well as the company s ability to continue to purchase lower cost pagers to lease to customers 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to less capital spending on opening new retail stores as well as the company s ability to continue to purchase lower cost pagers to lease to customers 
teletouch anticipates that capital expenditures will remain flat in fiscal as the company plans to only replace necessary equipment to maintain the paging infrastructure while continuing to purchase an adequate supply of pagers to lease to customers 
teletouch will pay for these expenditures with cash generated from operations 
under the new or amended credit agreements entered into may  with first community financial corporation  tll partners and ing prime rate trust see discussion below obligations and commitments  the company has available borrowings of million of which million was funded as of may obligations and commitments the following tables outline what we regard as our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  payments due by period in thousands significant contractual less than obligations total year to years to years over years debt    operating leases     total significant contractual cash obligations     as of may   the company had been unable to amend or negotiate new terms under its senior credit agreement  which would have enabled the company to remain in compliance therewith and thereunder as of may   and for subsequent periods 
the resulting inability to comply with the terms of the credit agreement resulted in the occurrence of events of default under the credit agreement which could have permitted the lender to terminate the commitment and to declare the borrowings totaling million to be due and payable 
also  based on the terms of the junior subordinated note agreement  if the lender had declared the company not in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement  then by definition it would not have been in compliance with the terms of the junior subordinated note agreement resulting in an additional million becoming due and payable as of may  restructure of senior debt on may   pursuant to agreements executed on may   teletouch reorganized its debt  retiring approximately  in outstanding principal and  in accrued interest in senior debt owed by teletouch under its senior credit agreement to a syndicate of commercial lenders  by paying those lenders an aggregate cash amount of  and delivering a promissory note in the principal amount of  to one of the lenders  ing prime rate trust formerly known as pilgrim america prime rate trust pilgrim the debt reorganization 
the second amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement dated as of may  by and among teletouch and pilgrim  as administrative agent for the lender  which amended and restated the prior credit agreement effected the debt reorganization and resulted in the reduction of the aggregate principal debt under the debt facility to  the pilgrim promissory note 
the restructured debt outstanding under the amended credit agreement is collateralized by assets of teletouch and its subsidiaries including certain real property owned by teletouch in tyler  texas  all of the capital stock of teletouch licenses  inc tli  a wholly owned subsidiary of teletouch  that owns the paging and other licenses utilized in teletouch s operations  all of teletouch s and tli s respective rights in the license management agreement between teletouch and tli  pursuant to which teletouch manages and utilizes the licenses owned by tli  and certain other collateral as set forth in the amended credit agreement  but excluding the collateral securing the first community financial corporation debt facility described below

the amended credit agreement contains a number of prohibitions and limitations of teletouch s activities  including a prohibition of the payment of dividends by teletouch 
failure to comply with the terms of the amended credit agreement will result in an event of default which in turn will allow pilgrim to terminate the commitment and to declare the borrowings to be due and payable 
the new note is collateralized by a new deed of trust  an assignment of rents and leases  an agreement collateralizing all of the capital stock of tli  and a fixture filing on certain real property in tyler  texas 
in order to complete the reorganization of its debt and to provide for necessary working capital financing  teletouch also entered into new credit agreements with first community financial corporation and tll partners

no advances will be made by fcfc if an event of default as that term is defined under the fcfc security agreement occurs and teletouch fails to cure the event of default 
the map note matures upon the termination of the fcfc security agreement 
the fcfc security agreement provides for an initial term of two years from date of execution and subsequent one year renewal terms 
in consideration for establishing the line of credit  teletouch paid to fcfc a commitment and funding fee of  on the date the company executed the map note

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in teletouch s market risk sensitive instruments  such as its credit facilities is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
at may   the debt obligations with fcfc  comprised of the map note and the term note were subject to variable interest rates 
the map note is a short term revolving line of credit that is borrowed against and repaid as often as daily 
due to the revolving nature of the map note and the company s ability to choose whether to obligate itself through borrowings  the inherent risk in the map note is minimal related to changes in interest rates 
additionally  the borrowings under the term note as of may  were less than of the total debt obligations of the company  therefore  changes in interest rates would have an insignificant impact on the company s earnings
