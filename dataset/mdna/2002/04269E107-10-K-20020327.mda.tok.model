item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the production and development of novel chemical compounds with commercial potential in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we primarily manufacture arrays of synthesized compounds for delivery to our customers for use in lead compound generation and lead compound optimization activities 
in addition  we have established a number of joint drug discovery programs with biotechnology companies and academic institutions  and are pursuing a limited number of our own internal drug discovery programs 
we primarily generate revenue through our collaborative agreements for production and delivery of compound arrays and other research and development services 
under many of these collaborative agreements  we are also entitled to receive milestone and royalty payments if the customer develops products resulting from the collaboration 
to date  we have received two milestone payments and no royalty payments 
in addition  we have not yet realized any revenue from our joint discovery programs with biotechnology companies and academic institutions  or from our internal drug discovery programs 
while we expect our revenue to increase in  our financial performance may vary from expectations  including quarterly variations in performance  because levels of revenue are dependent on expanding or continuing existing collaborations  entering into additional corporate collaborations  receiving future milestones and royalty payments  and realizing value from ongoing drug discovery programs  all of which are difficult to anticipate 
see the discussion of our revenue recognition policy in our critical accounting policies below 
we will continue to invest in technologies that enhance and expand our capabilities in drug discovery 
these continued investments in technology are intended to enhance the novelty  diversity  and medical relevance of our compound arrays and to augment the power and scope of our chemistry capabilities 
in addition to investments in technology  we may invest in internal lead optimization programs with the goal of delivering clinical candidates 
investments of this nature may result in near term earnings fluctuations or impact the magnitude of profitability or loss 
in november  we sold  shares of common stock at per share in a follow on public offering 
this included the exercise of the overallotment option of  shares 
the offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we exercised our options to purchase our building and the adjacent lot in woburn  massachusetts and in march we closed the transaction 
the total consideration paid for the properties was million  of which million represented the purchase price for the entire building and the land on which it sits and million represented the purchase price for the adjacent lot 
the purchase price was determined through an arms length negotiation with metro north corporate center llc and metro north corporate center llc ii  which are unaffiliated with us or any of our directors or executive officers 
we paid million in cash and we amended and extended our term loan agreement with fleet national bank to borrow an additional million in order to finance this facility and land purchase 
principal amounts are payable in equal quarterly installments beginning on april  we made four million payments in interest payments are made monthly in arrears beginning on the first day of the month following commencement of the amended agreement 
interest accrues at the rate of one month libor plus  as of december  in january  we acquired camitro corporation  a privately held predictive modeling company based in menlo park  california 
at the time of the acquisition  camitro had developed various computational models for admet characterization of compounds based on their structure 
during the past year  arqule has been advancing and integrating a suite of these predictive models into its chemistry based technology platform to aid in the design  selection and optimization of pharmaceutical drug candidates 
we believe these models will enable arqule to profile virtual libraries of compounds to decide which compounds to make from among the thousands or millions of compounds that we could make 
the models are also useful for compound redesign during lead optimization 
for example  the metabolism models are unique in their ability to direct a chemist to change particular sites on a compound to improve its metabolic stability 
as more data are developed using the technology  the models themselves are refined 
consequently  the process of developing and integrating the models is an ongoing one 
as we seek to change the nature of the drug discovery process  we will continue to improve the predictive modeling and other aspects of our integrated technology platform 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of camitro s outstanding shares and the assumption of all of camitro s outstanding stock options and warrants 
the merger transaction was valued at million based on our share price on the measurement date for the merger 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
upon consummation of the camitro acquisition in january  we immediately charged to income million representing the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate in each project takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the purchased in process technology 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on our management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects 
the net cash flows reflect the assumptions that would be used by market participants 
if these projects are not successfully developed  our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
we are continuously monitoring our development projects 
management believes that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology represent a reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
we plan to use our existing cash to develop the purchased in process technology related to the acquisition of camitro into commercially viable products 
this primarily consists of the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume manufacturing verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
we are actively engaged in combining this camitro technology  including predictive admet modeling  into our integrated science and technology platform 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million through december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities related to our efforts to develop our technologies and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
while we were profitable in fiscal year  we were not profitable in  we expect that we will not be profitable in and our ability to achieve sustained profitability is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to perform under our collaborations at the expected cost  expand or continue existing collaborations  timing of additional investments in technology and the realization of value from the development and commercialization of products in which we have an economic interest  all of which are difficult to anticipate 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forward looking statements reflecting management s current expectations regarding our future performance 
such expectations are based on certain assumptions regarding the progress of product development efforts under collaborative agreements  the executions of new collaborative agreements and other factors relating to our growth 
such expectations may not materialize if product development efforts are delayed or suspended  if negotiations with potential collaborators are delayed or unsuccessful or if other assumptions prove incorrect 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenues for were million as compared to million in  an increase of million or approximately percent 
this increase is primarily due to increased fees of approximately million for delivery of custom array tm sets from to to pfizer and bayer 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in totaled million  an increase of million or percent as compared to the increase in costs of revenue was attributable to increased costs for producing custom array tm sets for pfizer and bayer 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the prior year 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was lower in due to increased costs relating to the bayer collaboration 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in were million  an increase of million or percent as compared to million in this increase is the result of our ongoing efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry  predictive and computational modeling capabilities and related proprietary technologies  including increased personnel  as we expand our drug discovery programs and technology platform 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million or percent as compared to million in the increase was primarily associated with increased support costs  including increased personnel  to support our growth during amortization of intangibles and other merger related charges 
we recorded an million in process research and development charge  million in stock based compensation and million in amortization of intangibles in as a result of our acquisition of camitro in net investment income 
net investment income consists primarily of interest income partially offset by interest expense and other non operating income and expenses 
investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of million or approximately percent 
our higher investment income in is a result of our higher average cash balance in due to our million stock offering in november  offset by lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio when compared to interest expense in was million as compared to million in  resulting primarily from our higher average debt balance on our term loan with fleet national bank 
net income loss 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to our net income of million for the same period in our net loss in was primarily attributable to our increased investments in drug discovery programs and the merger related charges due to our acquisition of camitro corporation 
years ended december  and revenue 
total revenues for were million as compared to million in  an increase of million or approximately percent 
this increase is primarily due to the amortization of upfront fees of approximately million and fees for delivery of custom array tm sets of approximately million to pfizer inc and bayer ag and from other delivery fees earned from our collaborations 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in totaled million  an increase of million or percent as compared to the increase in costs of revenue was attributable to increased costs for producing custom array tm sets for pfizer inc and bayer ag 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the prior year 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher in due to the higher gross margin on the pfizer collaboration and other economies of scale 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in were million  an increase of million or percent as compared to million in this increase is the result of our ongoing efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry capabilities and related proprietary technologies  including increased personnel  as we expand our lead optimization programs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
marketing and general administrative expenses in were million in  an increase of million or percent as compared to the increase was due primarily associated with increased administrative costs  including increased personnel  to support our growth during net investment income 
net investment income consists primarily of interest income partially offset by interest expense and other non operating income and expenses 
investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of million or approximately percent 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  resulting primarily from our higher average debt balance on our term loan with fleet national bank 
net income loss 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in our net income in has been primarily attributable to increased revenue from our collaborator base 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with a value of million  compared to million at december  our working capital at december  was million 
we have funded operations through december  with sales of common stock  payments from corporate collaborators  and the utilization of bank financing 
in march of  we consummated a term loan agreement with fleet national bank  which we expanded in march of  to support our facilities expansion 
under this expanded agreement  we have borrowed million 
as of december   we have made principal payments of million and had an outstanding balance of million 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the same period in this decrease is a result of our net operating loss  excluding non cash charges  in cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  decreased million to a use of cash of million from million provided by investing activities for the same period in during  we purchased our woburn facility for million  made a million investment in a privately owned proteomics company  and shifted a significant portion of our cash raised in the november follow on stock offering from cash equivalents into marketable securities 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the same period in in november  we completed a follow on offering of million shares of our common stock that raised million net of expenses 
in december  pfizer made an equity investment of million 
we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  together with operating revenues and investment income will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements for the next several years 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for three consecutive years  and coupled with our existing cash and marketable securities  we believe that even without additional funding we would have sufficient funds to operate for at least the next several years 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into any additional corporate collaborations in the future and the terms of such collaborations  the results of research and development  the need for currently unanticipated capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers for our products and services  or that such products and services will produce revenues adequate to fund our operating expenses 
if we experience increased losses  we may have to seek additional financing from public or private sales of our securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or on acceptable terms 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition for agreements entered into with various collaborators and our intangible assets 
arqule has entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
revenue from collaborative agreements includes non refundable technology transfer fees  funding of compound development work  the delivery of compounds  payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborators specified criteria  and certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable technology transfer fees are recognized as revenue when we have the contractual right to receive such payment  provided a contractual arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
when we have performance obligations under the terms of a contract  non refundable fees are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations 
where our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
funding of compound development work is recognized over the term of the applicable contract using the percentage of completion method using the proportional achievement of deliveries against a compound delivery schedule or the development labor is expended against a total research and development labor plan as the measure of progress toward completion 
any significant changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates to complete could impact our revenue recognition 
payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborator s specified criteria are recognized as revenue once the collaborator has accepted the delivery of these compounds and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
payments received under these arrangements prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred revenue 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are in full compliance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab intangible assets primarily relate to the value of the core technology and goodwill from our acquisition of camitro corporation 
the cost of the core technology and goodwill is being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas will require that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december   with early application permitted in certain circumstances 
we will adopt sfas and sfas in fiscal the balance of goodwill is approximately million at december  we do not expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption 
goodwill will not be amortized beginning on january  goodwill amortization expense was million for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective january  sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective january  sfas supersedes fasb statement no  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of long lived assets 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds and us government and other investment grade debt securities 
these investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
our use of derivative financial instruments is limited to the utilization of two interest rate swap agreements 
settlement accounting is used for these interest rate swaps  whereby amounts to be paid or received under the interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change and are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our use of derivatives and other financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  due to the short term maturities of these instruments
