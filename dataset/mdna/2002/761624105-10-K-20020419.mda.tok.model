recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts at their fair values  as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 which amended sfas no 
such that the effective date of adoption will be for fiscal quarters beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in june  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently have no material goodwill or other intangibles  therefore  the provisions of sfas that became effective for us on february  will have no material effect on our results of operations and financial position

under sfas  assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be include in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations prospectively 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption encouraged 
sfas is not expected to materially change the methods we use to measure impairment losses on long lived assets  but may result in future dispositions being reported as discontinued operations to a greater extent than is currently permitted 
we adopted sfas on february  forward looking statements this form k contains or may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the words believes  estimates  plans  expects  intends  anticipates and similar expressions as they relate to rex or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements
