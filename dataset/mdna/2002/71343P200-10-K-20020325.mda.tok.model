item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating results compared with due to the merger with the former pepsiamericas completed in november  the company believes that comparison to pro forma results for provides a better indication of current operating trends than reported results 
therefore  included within the following discussion are explanations of both reported results and the pro forma results 
pro forma operating results assume the merger with the former pepsiamericas occurred at the beginning of pro forma operating results also exclude the impact of special charges and credits recorded in and net sales net sales for and were as follows in millions reported pro forma unaudited percent percent change change domestic     international total sales     on a reported basis  net sales increased by million  or percent  in compared with  primarily reflecting sales contributed by the additional territories acquired in the merger with the former pepsiamericas  as well as the acquisition of the trinidad and tobago territory in december the balance of the growth in net sales reflected improved pricing and slightly higher volumes in the domestic markets and higher sales in central europe 
on a pro forma basis  net sales increased by million  or percent 
the growth in net sales includes an increase in domestic sales of million and an increase in international sales of million 
excluding sales contributed in and by the beer operations  which the company divested in the first quarter of  domestic sales increased million  or percent 
the increase in domestic sales resulted from a percent improvement in pricing and a 
percent increase in volume 
although volume growth was low  principally due to an approximately two percent volume decline in trademark pepsi products  aquafina volume grew nearly percent  trademark mountain dew grew approximately two percent and flavored carbonated soft drinks grew approximately percent 
the higher international sales resulted from improved volume  up percent  and higher net pricing  up percent 
these factors were partially offset by a planned reduction in international private label revenues 
gross profit the consolidated gross profit margin on a reported basis decreased to percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in  driven primarily by a lower domestic gross profit margin attributable to the inclusion in of a full year of results of lower margin territories within the former pepsiamericas 
on a pro forma basis  and excluding results from the divested beer operations  the consolidated gross profit margin decreased to percent of sales in compared with percent in the domestic gross profit margin was down slightly  as the benefits of higher net selling prices were offset by increased ingredient and packaging costs 
the increase in packaging costs was primarily related to the company s shift in sales mix to non returnable pet containers supporting aquafina and other non carbonated beverage growth 
the international gross profit margin was flat as compared to selling  delivery and administrative expenses reported selling  delivery and administrative sd a expenses represented percent of sales in  compared with percent in the decline in the percentage of sd a expenses is primarily attributable to the impact of the lower cost structure of the caribbean operations of the former pepsiamericas  which were included in reported results for only one month in on a pro forma basis  and excluding results from the divested beer operations  sd a expenses as a percent of sales were percent in compared with percent in domestic sd a costs as a percent of sales were slightly higher in the increase in domestic sd a was driven in part by increased costs associated with the growth in aquafina and other non carbonated beverage offerings  as well as new product introductions 
costs were driven in part by previous investment in cold drink equipment and information technology investments associated with the integration of the former pepsiamericas and heartland territories  resulting in higher depreciation in the current year 
costs were also driven by investments in inventory systems  which are partially deployed across the domestic operations  and the next generation selling system  which is in the early stages of development 
the next generation selling system is expected to be deployed over the next three years 
upon final deployment  a significant portion of the company s domestic distribution system will be converted to a pre sell environment 
as expected  the benefits of the merger with the former pepsiamericas were offset almost entirely by non recurring integration costs of approximately million to million 
international sd a costs as a percent of sales were lower due to cost improvements and the benefits of volume growth and increased pricing

the company expects to realize these savings beginning in  with full benefits realized in in  the company recorded special charges of million million after tax  including million in costs for severance and other benefits and million of costs resulting from a decision to close the company s production facility in ft 
wayne  indiana 
the charge for the closure of the production facility included a write down of building and equipment and million for severance payments and other benefits 
as a result of the actions taken with respect to the merger with the former pepsiamericas  which resulted in the special charge of million in the first quarter of and the special charges of million in  the company expects to realize annual savings of approximately million  primarily in and this includes reduced employee related costs in both the existing territories and the territories of the former pepsiamericas and the benefits of centralized procurement through pepsico

the payments made during and included deferred severance payments made to previously terminated employees 
at the end of fiscal year  million of employee related costs were accrued 
the company expects to pay substantially all of these costs during the next twelve months and has included them in current liabilities 
gain on pension curtailment in connection with the integration of the former whitman and former pepsiamericas domestic benefit plans during the first quarter of  the company amended its pension plans to freeze pension benefit accruals for substantially all salaried and non union employees effective december  employees age or older with or more years of vesting service were grandfathered such that they will continue to accrue benefits after december  based on their final average pay as of december  as a result of this plan amendment  the company recognized a one time curtailment gain of million million after tax 
the existing domestic salaried and non union pension plans were replaced by an additional company contribution to the k plan beginning january  operating income operating income for and was as follows in millions reported pro forma unaudited percent percent change change domestic international total operating income in  operating income on a reported basis increased million  which primarily reflects the additional operating income contributed by the domestic territories of the former pepsiamericas 
the reported domestic operating income included a gain on pension curtailment of million in and special charges of million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the gain on pension curtailment and the charges  the domestic operating income increased million  or percent 
the operating income contributed by the former pepsiamericas territories is primarily responsible for the improved results 
the operating losses in reported by the international operations included special charges of million 
excluding the impact of these charges  operating losses were reduced by million 
the improved trend in operating losses was primarily the result of improved results in central europe  driven by higher volumes and improved pricing 
on a pro forma basis  operating income declined million  or 
percent  in compared with  including a million improvement in international operating losses  partially offset by a million reduction in domestic operating income 
the improved results in the international operations are principally the result of higher volumes and improved pricing 
the lower domestic operating income principally resulted from the decline in trademark pepsi volume as overall volume growth was 
percent in increased sd a  concentrate and packaging costs associated with aquafina growth  new product introductions and other non carbonated growth more than offset the benefits of improved pricing 
interest and other expenses net interest expense increased million in to million 
the increase was due principally to an increase in the average outstanding net debt resulting from the merger with the former pepsiamericas  partially offset by lower borrowing costs resulting from the refinancing of debt in the first quarter of  the swap of a portion of the company s debt portfolio from fixed rate to floating rate  and lower overall interest rates on short term borrowings 
the company reported other expense of million in compared with other income of million in included in other income in is a gain of million resulting from the sale of the franchise operations in the baltics

in the fourth quarter of  the company engaged third party consultants with expertise in environmental remediation  insurance and risk containment to review the company s environmental liabilities 
the consultants developed estimates of the most likely cost of remediating contamination related to pneumo abex s past operations and disposal practices 
the company also estimated additional consulting and legal expenses related to such remediation 
after recording these charges  the company has reserves of approximately million  including amounts held in outside trusts  for future remediation and other related costs arising out of its indemnification of previously sold businesses 
the company expects to spend approximately million to million in for remediation and other related costs 
income from discontinued operations after taxes of million in resulted from the reversal of prior accruals resulting from certain insurance settlements for environmental matters related to pneumo abex  partially offset by increased environmental and related accruals

operating results compared with due to the merger with the former pepsiamericas completed in november and the transaction with pepsico completed in may  the company believes that pro forma results provide a better indication of current operating trends than reported results

net sales net sales for and were as follows in millions reported pro forma unaudited percent percent change change domestic     international total sales     on a reported basis  net sales increased by million  or percent  in compared with  primarily reflecting sales contributed by the additional territories acquired in the merger with the former pepsiamericas and the transaction with pepsico  as well as the acquisition of toma in december the balance of the growth in net sales reflected improved pricing in the domestic markets offset by a decline in volume 
on a pro forma basis  net sales increased by million  or percent 
the growth in net sales includes an increase in domestic sales of million and an increase in international sales of million 
the increase in domestic sales resulted from improved pricing  up nearly five percent  offset by a decline in volume  down percent for the full year 
despite the decline in volume  principally the result of volume declines in trademark pepsi products  aquafina volume grew nearly percent and lemon lime volume growth was bolstered by the introduction of sierra mist 
the higher international sales resulted from improved volume  up percent  offset by a decline in net pricing  down percent 
the lower net pricing in international is indicative of the currency devaluation impact in the central european territories 
the impact of currency devaluation is estimated to have reduced sales by approximately million in compared with the previous year 
gross profit the consolidated gross profit margin on a reported basis decreased to percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in the domestic gross profit margin was essentially unchanged  while the international gross profit margin declined due to the inclusion of lower margin toma products for the entire year in compared with only one month in and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency 
a portion of the product costs in the international operations is fixed in us dollars and therefore was not favorably affected by currency devaluation 
the consolidated gross profit margin on a pro forma basis decreased to percent of sales in compared with percent in the domestic gross profit margin improved slightly  while the international gross profit margin declined by percentage points 
the decline in the international gross profit margin is due to a portion of the product costs in the international operations being fixed in us dollars as discussed previously 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses reported sd a expenses represented percent of sales in  compared with percent in the decline in the percentage of sd a expenses is primarily attributable to the international operations  which reflects the benefits of currency devaluation on expenses as reported in us dollars and the lower sd a expenses incurred by the toma operations 
on a reported basis  toma was included for only one month in due to the acquisition being completed on december  on a pro forma basis  sd a expenses as a percent of sales were percent compared with percent in the basis point improvement was primarily the result of the benefits from currency devaluation experienced in central europe  which resulted in lower expenses as reported in us dollars

the improved trend in operating losses was the result of one month of operating results included for the caribbean territories and improved results in central europe  despite the adverse impact of currency devaluation 
on a pro forma basis  operating income increased million in compared with the improvement included an increase of million in operating income in the domestic operations and a million reduction in operating losses in the international operations 
the improved results in the domestic operations are principally the result of improved pricing in the domestic markets  offset by lower volumes  and cost reduction efforts initiated in the domestic territories acquired from pepsico 
the domestic operating margins improved basis points to percent in on a pro forma basis in international  improvements occurred in both central europe and the caribbean 
the improvements reflect lower operating costs in central europe and improved gross profit margins in the caribbean 
interest and other expenses net interest expense increased million in to million 
the increase was due principally to an increase in the average outstanding net debt resulting from the acquisitions completed during and in addition  increases in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and the three million shares of common stock repurchased in the first quarter of contributed to the increase in interest

the agreement involves the sale of receivables by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries to whitman finance  which in turn sells an undivided interest in a revolving pool of receivables to the financial institution 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by continuing operations decreased by million to million in the decrease was due primarily to the cash provided by the securitization which contributed million of cash flow in  partially offset by operating cash flow contributed in by the former pepsiamericas territories acquired from the former pepsiamercias and lower income tax payments made in whitman finance currently does not purchase any receivables associated with the former pepsiamericas domestic territories 
it is expected those territories receivables will be included in activity with whitman finance beginning in upon completing the integration of the accounts receivable systems

the company paid cash dividends of million in based on an annual cash dividend of  compared with million paid in  based on the same dividend rate 
the issuance of common stock  including treasury shares  for the exercise of stock options resulted in cash inflows of million in  compared with million in the decrease in cash inflows in is due to shares issued to shareholders of the former pepsiamericas under the share subscription rights in see note to the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
commodity prices the risk from commodity price changes correlates to the company s ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of its aluminum and fuel requirements 
each instrument hedges price fluctuations on a portion of the company s aluminum can and fuel requirements over a specified period of time 
because of the high correlation between aluminum and fuel commodity prices and the company s contractual cost of these products  the company considers these hedges to be highly effective 
as of fiscal year end  the company has hedged a portion of its future aluminum and fuel requirements into fiscal interest rates the company s floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month libor rate and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of fiscal year end  a basis point change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on the company s annual interest expense 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to floating rate 
in  the company had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to the overnight federal funds rate 
the amount of these investments was not significant throughout the year 
assuming a basis point change in the rate of interest associated with the company s short term investments  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
currency exchange rates because the company operates in international franchise territories  it is subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
the company currently does not hedge the translation risks of investments in its international operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
based on sales  international operations represented approximately percent of the company s total operations in changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the results of the international operations from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by five percent in  the company estimates the impact on reported operating income would have been approximately million 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category
