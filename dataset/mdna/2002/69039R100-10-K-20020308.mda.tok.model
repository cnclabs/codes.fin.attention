overview overture is the leader in pay for performance search on the internet 
we introduce consumers and businesses that search the internet to advertisers who bid for placement in our search results  which are ranked by the advertisers bid price 
advertisers pay us only when consumers and businesses click through to the advertisers search listings  so we refer to our service as pay for performance search 
we provide consumers and businesses with relevant search results by charging advertisers for each paid introduction  or clickthrough  and by requiring advertisers to bid only on keywords that are relevant to their offering 
we distribute our search results to consumers and businesses through our affiliates  a network of portals  web browsers  internet service providers and other web properties  as well as through our own web site 
we believe our service offers advertisers a highly targeted  controllable and cost effective marketing solution and provides affiliates with incremental revenue and a relevant search service 
overture was incorporated in september and has approximately a four year operating history 
we launched a proof of concept version of our search service in the fiscal year ended december  our pay for performance service was announced in february  and following further proof of concept testing  was officially launched in june overture has devoted significant resources to launching and expanding its search service  including developing an infrastructure and building a management team 
on october   goto 
com  inc changed its name to overture services  inc through the acquisition of cadabra in january  overture operated a comparison shopping site  goto shopping 
on april   overture closed its comparison shopping site 
through the acquisition of auctionrover in may  overture operated an auction service  goto auctions 
on june   overture completed a management buyout of goto auctions  whereby the operating management of goto auctions purchased goto auctions assets from overture 
the newly formed company is called channeladvisor corporation 
overture retains a minority stake of in this new corporation  whose goal is to provide online and offline businesses with the ability to leverage online auctions as a channel of distribution 
in connection with the disposition of goto auctions and closure of goto shopping operations  overture incurred net one time charges of approximately million and million  respectively  in the year ending december  in  the company incurred total losses of approximately million which includes non cash charges of approximately million of amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions of cadabra  auctionrover and the assets of searchup  a write off of approximately million for acquired in process research and development  and a million write down of impaired goodwill associated with the cadabra and auctionrover acquisitions 
a significant component of our expenses consist of costs incurred to attract consumers and businesses to our service through our affiliate network 
we expect to continue to rely upon these sources for the majority of searches conducted on our service 
our future success is dependent upon increasing the revenue we derive from this traffic 
a significant portion of the company s traffic is and has been generated from a small number of the company s larger affiliates 
if we are not successful in renewing any of these agreements  or if they are renewed but on less favorable terms  it could harm our business and ability to generate revenue 
international expansion we launched our service in the united kingdom in november and launched our german speaking search service in february we are considering launching our search service in japan and france in we expect our international expansion will require continued investment to build internal infrastructure and grow our advertiser and affiliate bases overseas

revenue is generated primarily through paid introductions  that is  overture generates revenue when a user clicks on an advertiser s listings after an advertiser has bid for priority placement in search results by making a payment based on this clickthrough 
revenue is recognized when earned based on click through activity to the extent that the advertiser has deposited sufficient funds with us or collection is probable 
revenue also consists of banner advertising  and our full serve and full serve advantage programs  whereby the company charges a service fee for listing services 
banner advertising  full serve and full serve advantage constitute less than and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
banner advertisement revenue is recognized when earned under the terms of the contractual arrangement with the advertiser or advertising agency  provided that collection is probable 
full serve and full serve advantage revenue is recognized when overture has provided all of the services under the terms of the arrangement 
overture has no barter transactions 
the number of worldwide paid introductions for each of the last twelve fiscal quarters is as follows number of paid introductions for the quarter ended million december  million september  million june  million march  million december  million september  million june  million march  million december  million september  million june  million march  
table of contents the average price per paid introduction results from advertisers online bidding for priority placement in the search results 
the worldwide average price per paid introduction for each of the last twelve fiscal quarters is as follows average price per paid introduction for the quarter ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  we believe the increase in the worldwide number of paid introductions from september  to december  was primarily due to the addition of large affiliate partners  yahoo and excite 
com  as well as seasonality  as internet usage typically leads to more paid introductions during the period from october to december 
we believe that the worldwide average price per paid introduction increased as a result of better than expected effects of seasonality 
in addition  advertisers are increasing their budgets with overture  as the average spend per advertiser in the three months ended december  rose by over the previous three months and by in the three months ended september  compared to the three months ended june  we cannot assure you that the paid introductions and average price per click will continue to increase and if it does increase  at what rate  or that it will not decrease from historical levels 
we believe the quarterly number of paid introductions and average price per paid introduction listed above are not necessarily indicative of future results and that the periods prior to the three month period ended september  are not relevant because our service was only in its initial stage 
it is difficult to forecast the future growth of the average price per paid introduction  as advertisers  rather than overture  determine the price paid 
we believe that after our large increase in traffic  we may experience a drop in the average price per paid introduction and may subsequently experience a recovery period in which the price may continue to drop slightly or be flat for a period of time 
we do not anticipate our historical revenue growth rate expressed as a percentage of revenue  to continue 
our growth rate and results depend on our ability to continue to increase the number of advertisers who use our service  the amount our advertisers spend on our service and the number of consumers who use our service 
traffic from affiliates varies as we enter into new agreements and existing agreements are renewed or expire 
we anticipate these variables to fluctuate  affecting our growth rate and results 
revenue was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of continued growth of our marketplace and the corresponding participants  our affiliates and advertisers 
we do not anticipate our historical revenue growth rate to continue as a percentage of growth as expressed on a year to year basis 
our growth is dependent on obtaining additional traffic and increasing the average price per paid introduction 
during the quarter ended december   approximately of overture s total traffic came from portals  including alta vista  aol  excite 
com  go 
com  iwon  terra lycos and yahoo  approximately of the total traffic came from the browsers  including microsoft internet explorer and netscape  and approximately of the total traffic came from other affiliates including ask jeeves  infospace including metacrawler and dogpile and our web site 
even though we currently anticipate growth in traffic from existing and new affiliates  we must renew our affiliate agreements or replace this traffic with other sources and grow our advertising base  otherwise  our revenue may be materially  adversely affected 
search serving 
search serving costs consist primarily of costs associated with serving our search results  maintaining our web site and fees paid to outside service providers that provide and manage our unpaid listings 
costs associated with serving our search results and maintaining our web site include depreciation of web site equipment  co location charges for our web site equipment bandwidth  software license fees and salaries of related personnel 
search serving costs were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increased database and hardware capacity requirements as a result of an increase in our affiliate base and corresponding number of searches  an increase in the number of personnel required to support our services and increased fees paid to outside service providers 
we anticipate search serving costs to continue to increase as our traffic and number of advertisers increase 

table of contents traffic acquisition 
traffic acquisition costs relate to payments made to our affiliates that have integrated the overture search service into their sites or that direct consumer and business traffic to the overture web site 
there are generally three ways that economic terms of affiliate agreements are structured fixed payments based on a guaranteed minimum amount of traffic delivered  variable payments based on a percentage of our revenue or based on a certain metric  such as number of searches or paid clicks  or a combination of the above 
traffic acquisition costs were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased distribution of our search service 
we believe that increased distribution of our search services is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect these costs to continue to increase in the future 
in addition to our domestic affiliates  we anticipate traffic acquisition costs to also increase as a result of the expansion of our service overseas 
because overture has only recently entered into the overseas markets  we expect traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue to be considerably higher in those markets as we expand overseas 
the following are overture s significant affiliate agreements affiliate commencement expiration date aol august march aol europe uk  germany and france january march altavista november may compuserve may may yahoo november june netscape premier provider july june infoseek go 
com march march ask jeeves july july iwon january july terra lycos november november freeserve uk november november microsoft february december infospace november february traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to better margins on new or renegotiated agreements  and in cases where traffic acquisition costs were fixed and payments were guaranteed  revenue increases  which were proportionately more than the respective traffic acquisition costs  resulted in better margins 
traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue were approximately and in the fourth quarters ended december  and  respectively 
throughout  we have been able to improve margins due to our increasing ability to monetize search 
we anticipate traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue to be between and in 
table of contents marketing  sales and service 
marketing  sales and service expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  customer service and sales functions  advertising and promotional expenditures  and cost of systems used to sell and serve advertisers 
marketing  sales and service expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  although marketing  sales and service expenses were constant from year to year  we anticipate that these costs will rise in the future as we continue to expand our marketplace  including international expansion  and invest in product quality 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  facilities  professional services  including legal  insurance and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of increased headcount and related expenses  including facilities  credit card processing fees and increased personnel related insurance costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase with the growth of our business 
in addition  we expect these costs to grow as a result of our international expansion efforts  as our international expansion efforts are at an early stage and we will experience costs related to establishing infrastructure in international locations 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel responsible for development of features and functionality for our service  as well as costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stage of computer software developed for internal use 
statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop requires that cost incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized 
product development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease was a result of the closure of goto shopping and disposition of goto auctions and increased staffing and associated costs relating to enhancing features and functionality to our web site and search service  net of capitalization of software under sop of approximately million in the year ended december  we believe our continued investment in product development and product quality is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect product development expenses to increase in the future 
amortization of deferred compensation 
certain stock options granted from the inception of overture through our initial public offering have been considered to be compensatory for financial accounting purposes 
overture also issued options below fair market value in  which are considered compensatory 
total compensation expense resulting from these stock options amounted to approximately million 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of the grants or issuances  adjusted for the return of unvested options or the repurchase of restricted stock resulting from employee terminations 
compensation associated with these stock options is amortized and expensed over the applicable vesting periods using a graded methodology 
approximately  and million were amortized and charged to operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
based on existing grants  we expect to have charges to amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  in the year end december  and the remaining approximately  through loss on closure of goto shopping 
on april   overture closed its goto shopping operations and recorded a charge for restructuring and exit costs 
the net charges were approximately million  which included approximately  of cash termination benefits associated with the involuntary termination of goto shopping employees

interest income 
interest income consists primarily of earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  net of interest expense attributable to leased equipment 
interest income was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower returns from our investments in commercial paper and treasury securities partially offset from earnings from additional cash proceeds from our follow on offering of approximately million received in july other income 
other income of approximately million for the year ended december  consists primarily of the reimbursement for legal costs associated with the settlement of the mercexchange litigation see note to the financial statements compared to approximately million for the year ended december   which consisted primarily of the settlement of litigation with disney 
provision for income taxes 
although the company had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards to offset its taxable income for the year ended december   it has recorded a current tax provision equal to the alternative minimum tax for both federal and california purposes of approximately  as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards are carried on the company s balance sheet as a deferred tax asset  but due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of its deferred tax assets from its net operating loss carryforwards in future years  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
the company expects to release the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets to the extent it has taxable income  therefore the company only expects to incur alternative minimum taxes in

impairment of intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of and in accordance with sfas  management identified certain conditions as indicators of asset impairment on the net assets from the acquisitions of cadabra and auctionrover 
these indicators included the significant decline in the valuations of public companies operating in the internet space 
management s re evaluation of its strategies and fit for these business lines 
a significant decrease in the stock price of overture compared to the purchase price of these acquisitions 
management s decision to decrease its investment in these business lines 
in accordance with sfas  an impairment loss should be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
the estimate of fair value shall consider selling prices or fair values for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques eg  discounted cash flows as well as other strategic and market factors to the extent available in the circumstances 
management has estimated the fair value of the net assets acquired  based on discounted future cash flows as well as strategic and market factors  to be below the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets 
accordingly  overture took a charge to operations during the fourth quarter of for approximately million  to write down these assets 
an additional factor considered by management was the difficulty in estimating future cash flows for the comparison shopping business line and the internet auctions business line because they were still in their infancy 
overture exited the comparison shopping and auctions businesses in interest income 
interest income was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to overture s holding the initial public offering proceeds for the entire year of versus partial year in  together with the million settlement paid by the walt disney company to overture in settlement of trademark litigation  offset by the declining balance of cash and investments

table of contents accounting policies subject to estimation and judgment the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  long term contracts  intangible assets  income tax  restructuring and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the notes of the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following accounting policies are more subject to management s estimates and judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
income tax as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards are carried on the company s balance sheet as a deferred tax asset  but due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of its deferred tax assets from its net operating loss carryforwards in future years  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
financial accounting statement standard no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be setup to reduce a deferred tax asset to the extent it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
in order for a company to realize the tax benefits associated with a net operating loss  it must have taxable income within the applicable carryback or carryfoward periods 
sources of taxable income that may allow for the realization of those tax benefits include taxable income in the current year or prior years that is available though a carryback claim  future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  ie the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and future taxable income generated by future operations 
sfas indicates that all available evidence  both positive and negative  should be identified and considered in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
examples of positive evidence include strong earnings history existing contracts or backlog  and assets with net built in gains for tax purposes 
examples of negative evidence include but are not limited to the following a pretax loss for financial reporting purposes for the current or a recent preceding year  a deficit in stockholders equity  a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  and cumulative losses in recent years 

table of contents we believe that overture s losses in recent years present negative evidence that required a valuation allowance to be set up to reduce the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating losses 
accordingly  the company has not taken a benefit for that asset 
if the company generates taxable income in  this would be positive evidence that could allow the company to release a portion of the valuation allowance set up against the asset 
however  since the company still has losses in recent years and because there is no other compelling positive evidence  we believe that it would not be appropriate for the company to release any more of the valuation than can be utilized in in addition to generating taxable income  if overture had other positive evidence  for example signing multi year affiliate agreements with large portals  the company could release a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance  which would result in a tax benefit in the period such determination was made 
affiliate prepayments and commitments the company s agreements with some of its affiliates may include prepayments or commitments for future minimum payments to these affiliates 
the recoverability of prepayments and profitability related to future minimum payments and commitments are subject to the judgment of management 
periodically  the company assesses affiliate prepayments and commitments on a per agreement basis  considering historical margins  price per click and other financial trends  the development stage of the market  and any other relevant factors to determine realizability 
negative results from these assessments could result in additional one time charges to traffic acquisition expense resulting from the impairment writedown of prepayments or accrual of losses 

table of contents risks that could affect our financial condition and results of operations our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations because of many factors  and any of these could adversely affect our stock price we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that  in some future quarter  our operating results may be below historical levels  and or the expectations of public market analysts and investors and  as a result of these or other factors  the price of our common stock may fall and or significantly fluctuate 
the price of our common stock may decline or may be extremely volatile 
since our initial public offering in june  the per share trading price of our common stock has ranged from an intra day high of on november  to an intra day low of on december  our operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary widely from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including demand for our services by advertisers  consumers and businesses  including the number of searches performed by consumers and businesses and the rate at which they click through to paid search results  prices paid by advertisers using the overture services  which are not determined by overture  our costs of attracting consumers and businesses to use overture s services  including costs of exposure on affiliate web sites  decrease in traffic from our affiliates for any reason  including loss of our agreements with affiliates or demand for the services of affiliates  costs related to agreements with affiliates  ability to protect our business model from competitors  the percentage of overture s search listings that are bidded listings  our ability to maintain and grow our affiliate program including amendments  extensions or new affiliate agreements  seasonal fluctuations in the use of our service  typical of our industry  in which online traffic has typically been lower in the second and third quarters of the calendar year  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our operations  costs and delays in introducing any new overture services and improvements to existing services  our ability to successfully introduce new products or services  changes in the growth rate of internet usage and acceptance by consumers of e commerce  technical difficulties  system failures  system security breaches  or internet downtime  government regulations related to the internet  our ability to upgrade and develop our information technology systems and infrastructure  costs related to any acquisitions or dispositions of technologies or businesses  general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the internet and related industries  and ability to expand and compete internationally 

table of contents as a result of our limited operating history  it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue  and we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses 
we plan to significantly increase our operating expenses to expand our marketing and sales operations and broaden our customer support capabilities 
we base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and estimates of future revenue 
other than a portion of our affiliate costs  our expenses are relatively fixed 
revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend upon the volume of the searches conducted on our service  the amounts bid by advertisers for search listings on the service and the number of advertisers that bid on the service  each of which we cannot control directly 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we also may be unable to increase our spending and expand our operations in a timely manner to adequately meet user demand  to the extent such demand exceeds our expectations 
we depend on a limited number of sources to direct consumers and businesses to our service to conduct searches the consumers and businesses who conduct searches on our service come primarily from a limited number of sources 
our sources for consumers and businesses conducting searches are members of our affiliate network  including portals such as alta vista  aol  excite 
com  go 
com  iwon  msn  terra lycos and yahoo  providers of internet browsers such as microsoft internet explorer and netscape s browser product  aggregators of search offerings of various providers including ask jeeves  infospace including metacrawler and dogpile and from overture s web site 
in any given month  we typically depend upon one or a few of these sources for a significant amount of traffic and searches conducted on our service 
revenue is generated from clickthroughs that users make on advertisers listings and  generally  the more traffic from any given source  the greater number of clickthroughs we will generate 
of overture s total traffic  for the three months ended december   approximately came from our portal affiliate  approximately came from our browser affiliates and approximately came from other affiliates and our web site

table of contents even though we currently anticipate growth in traffic from existing and new affiliates  we must renew our affiliate agreements or replace this traffic with other sources and grow our advertising base  otherwise  our revenue may be materially  adversely affected 
we depend on each of our portal and browser affiliates and the loss of any of these affiliates could harm our revenue and business 
the amount of traffic from each of our affiliates has varied  and we expect it will continue to vary  from quarter to quarter  sometimes significantly  and in any single quarter we have been and could continue to be significantly dependent on traffic from a single or limited number of portal or browser affiliates 
certain of overture s affiliate agreements do not require the affiliate to display overture s search results and may allow the affiliate to stop displaying overture s search results after a short notice period 
if we are unable to replace traffic from any portal or browser affiliate after expiration of our contract with it or if an affiliate upon which we depend stops displaying overture s search results  it would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if we are significantly dependent on that affiliate at the time 
overture s agreements with its affiliates vary in initial duration from three months to three years  and depending on the agreement  may be terminable upon the occurrence of certain events  including for our failure to meet certain service levels  for general breaches of agreement terms  for changes in control or in some instances  at will 
we may not be successful in renewing any of these agreements  or if they are renewed  any new agreement may not be on as favorable terms 
we may not be successful in entering into distribution agreements with new affiliates on commercially acceptable terms 
in addition  several of these affiliates may be considered potential competitors  including yahoo 
in november  yahoo announced the launch of yahoo sponsor matches  which was introduced through an alliance with overture 
this agreement will be effective until at least june  at which time yahoo may offer its own sponsor matches program independently 
our success is dependent upon further developing and maintaining the affiliate network we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to further develop and maintain relationships with affiliates  which provide their users with overture services on their sites or direct their traffic to our web site 
we believe these relationships are important to facilitate broad market acceptance of our services and enhance our sales 
our ability to attract consumers to our services is dependent upon the growth of our affiliate network  which is new and unproven 
our success depends in part on the success of our affiliates and our relationships with our affiliates 
in addition  our affiliates may not regard us as significant for their own businesses 
therefore  they could reduce their commitment to us or terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our services 
if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with affiliates  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
our success depends upon achieving a large and active base of advertisers  consumers and businesses our ability to increase the volume of transactions on our service and the amounts bid by our advertisers is dependent upon achieving market acceptance by having more advertisers  consumers and businesses using our services 
most potential advertisers have only limited experience advertising on the internet and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to internet advertising 
advertising through priority placement on our services in particular has been introduced only recently  and we cannot predict the level of its acceptance as an advertising medium 
our services may not achieve significant acceptance by consumers and businesses 
among other things  because our services prioritize search results based on advertising bids associated with keywords rather than on algorithmic or other traditional search and retrieval technologies  consumers and businesses may not use our service because they perceive our results to be less objective than those provided by traditional search methods 
failure to achieve and maintain a large and active base of advertisers and of consumers and businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a limited number of advertisers if our major advertisers were to substantially cut back their advertising or stop using our services  our business would be seriously harmed 
although no one advertiser accounts for a material portion of our revenue during any given period  a majority of our total revenue is derived from a small proportion of our advertisers 
we believe that a substantial amount of revenue from advertising sales in any given future period may come from a relatively small number of advertisers 
we do not have formal contractual relationships with many of our advertisers  and when we do have contracts  all are terminable at any time by the advertiser 
as a result  our advertisers are not obligated to purchase advertising from us in the future 

table of contents we have a limited operating history  so we cannot be sure that we will be successful in implementing our business strategy overture was founded in september  officially launched its service in june  and has a limited operating history 
an investor in our common stock must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
these risks include our complete dependence on online advertising and consumer search services with only limited market acceptance  need to continually develop and upgrade our infrastructure  including internal controls  transaction processing systems  data storage and retrieval systems and web site  reliance on affiliates to direct consumers and businesses to our service to conduct searches  need to manage changing operations  and dependence upon and need to hire and retain key personnel 
the overture service may not retain its existing  or attract new  advertisers  consumers and businesses  and affiliates  which are web sites that include overture s pay for performance search services on their sites or that direct consumer traffic to the overture web site 
overture may not achieve additional revenues or maintain operating margins in future periods 
overture s services may not continue to achieve commercial acceptance and  if they do not  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our inability to continue to grow and maintain our advertiser  consumer and business  and affiliate constituencies could adversely affect our revenues and business our growth depends  in part  on the maintenance of a critical mass of advertisers  consumers and businesses  and affiliates  and the continued growth of these constituencies  which encourages increased participation by each of the constituencies 
to the extent that we experience a decline in the growth or number of any one constituency  the value of our service to one or more of our other constituencies could be harmed  and our revenues or business could be adversely affected 
a continued decline could seriously harm our revenues and business 
we cannot assure you we will not incur net losses in any particular future period prior to the six months ended december   we had a history of losses and we cannot assure you we will not incur net losses again in any particular future period 
although we had net income of approximately million in the year ended december  as a result of our achieving profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  we had net losses of approximately million for the six months ended june  and net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  because our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term  if our revenues do not keep pace with our expense levels  we may not sustain or increase profitability in any particular quarter or we may incur losses again 
we expect to continue to increase our marketing  sales and service and general and administrative expenses and we cannot be certain that revenue growth will continue to grow 
if our revenue growth does not continue  we may experience a loss in one or more future periods and it may as a result cause our stock price to decline 
this may in turn impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively overture competes with online services  other web sites and advertising networks such as doubleclick inc and media  inc  as well as traditional offline media such as television  radio and print  for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
we believe that the number of companies selling web based advertising and the available inventory of advertising space has recently increased 
accordingly  overture may face increased pricing pressure for the sale of advertisements and direct marketing opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents overture also competes with providers of web directories  search  and information services  all of which offer search services competitive to those provided by overture  including  among others  altavista  aol time warner inc  ask jeeves  inc  cnet  inc  fast search transfer asa  google  inc  inktomi corporation  looksmart  ltd  microsoft corporation linkexchange  inc and msn 
com  terra lycos including hotbot and yahoo  inc in addition  espotting media  findwhat 
com  inc  google and primedia  through its about 
com sprinks product  each offer a search based pay per click advertising service 
there are also other companies that offer directly competing services 
we have affiliate arrangements with companies that currently provide other search and advertising services  which may indirectly compete with our offerings  and may in the future offer their own pay per click search service 
recently  some of our search service competitors  such as google and terra lycos  have introduced pay per click advertising services that are similar to ours 
although we believe that our large network of affiliates  number of advertisers and proprietary technology differentiate our service from those of these competitors  we cannot assure you that another search service will not successfully offer a competitive pay per click advertising product 
we believe it is likely that there will be additional entrants to the pay per click search market 
these new competitors will likely compete against us for affiliate arrangements and therefore may require us to enter into affiliate agreements with less favorable terms or we may lose traffic from some affiliates 
these new competitors will also compete with us for users  which could reduce our number of clickthroughs and total revenues 
these new competitors could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  some of our competitors  as well as potential entrants into our market  have longer operating histories  larger customer or user bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these current and potential competitors can devote substantially greater resources to promotion and web site and systems development than we can 
in addition  as the use of the internet and other online services increases  larger  well established and well financed entities may continue to acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with providers of web directories  search and information services or advertising solutions  and existing providers of web directories  search and information services or advertising solutions may continue to consolidate 
in addition  providers of internet browsers and other internet products and services who are affiliated with providers of web directories and information services in competition with the overture service may more tightly integrate these affiliated offerings into their browsers or other products or services 
any of these trends would increase the competition we face and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face the risks of system failures we do not currently have fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site  but are in the process of implementing a comprehensive disaster recovery plan 
until a comprehensive disaster recovery plan is in place  a disaster such as fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  break in  sabotage or a similar event could severely damage our business and results of operations  because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  which are located in pasadena  california and at other offsite locations 
these offsite locations are managed by third parties in california  virginia  washington state and ireland 
any system failure  including network or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in our service or our affiliates service or the security of any other internet provider or a decrease in responsiveness could result in reduced traffic and reduced revenue 
although we believe that our current back up methods are adequate  the back up servers could fail or cause interruptions in our service 
our california and washington state sites exist on or near known earthquake fault zones 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or unanticipated problems at our principal headquarters or at a third party facility could cause interruptions or delays in our business  limited loss of data or could render us unable to provide some services 
in addition  failure by the third party facility to provide the data communications capacity required by us  as a result of human error  natural disaster or other operational disruptions  could cause interruptions in our service 
the occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our reputation  brand and business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents continued adoption of the internet as a method of conducting business is necessary for our future growth the failure of the internet to continue to develop as a commercial and business medium could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the widespread acceptance and adoption of the internet by traditional businesses for conducting business and exchanging information is likely only if the internet provides these businesses with greater efficiencies and improvements 
failure to expand internet infrastructure could limit our future growth the growth in internet traffic has caused frequent periods of decreased performance  and if internet usage continues to grow rapidly  the internet s infrastructure may not be able to support these demands  and its performance and reliability may decline 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our services depend upon improvements being made to the entire internet  as well as to the individual networking infrastructures of our advertisers  consumers and businesses  and affiliates to alleviate overloading and congestion 
increased security risks of online commerce may deter future use of our services concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of consumers may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  and online commerce in particular 
our failure to prevent security breaches could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  including advertiser credit card data  cause interruptions in our operations or damage our brand and reputation 
we do not believe that our data repositories  financial systems and other technology resources are completely secure from security breaches or sabotage  and we occasionally experience attempts at hacking or security breaches 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any well publicized compromise of our security or the security of any other internet provider could deter people from using our services or the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information or downloading sensitive materials  which would adversely affect the business of our advertisers and  accordingly  our business 
we have experienced significant growth in our business  and any failure to manage this growth could damage our business our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have increased  and plan to continue to increase  the scope of our operations 
these expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on management  and  if we do not manage growth properly  it could adversely affect our business 
we will need to expand our infrastructure  which will include hiring certain key employees and continuing to increase our headcount 
hiring key employees  in particular  has historically been difficult  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  marketing  sales and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lost the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be unable to execute our business model in international markets one component of our strategy is to expand our operations into selected international markets 
for example  we launched our service in the united kingdom in november and launched our german speaking search service in february we are considering launching our search service in japan and france during to date  we have only operated internationally in a few countries  and we may be unable to execute our business model in this market or new markets 
further  foreign providers of competing online services may have a substantial advantage over us in attracting users in their country due to earlier established businesses in that 
table of contents country  greater knowledge with respect to the cultural differences of users residing in that country and or their focus on a single market 
we expect to continue to experience higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with the development and maintenance of international online services 
international markets we have selected may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment 
in particular  international markets typically have been slower than domestic markets in adopting the internet as an advertising and commerce medium 
in pursuing our international expansion strategy  we face several additional risks  including lower per capita internet usage in many countries abroad  due to a variety of causes such as lower disposable incomes  lack of telecommunications and computer infrastructure and questions regarding adequate online security for e commerce transactions  relatively small internet markets in some countries  which may prevent us from aggregating sufficient traffic and advertising revenues and scaling our business model in those countries  entering into affiliate agreements with margins not as favorable as in the us  our potential inability to aggregate a large amount of internet traffic and find and develop relationships with international advertisers  consumers and businesses  and affiliates  competition in international markets from a broad range of competitors  including alta vista  espotting 
com  looksmart  yahoo and other united states and foreign search engines  content aggregators and portals  some of which have greater local experience than we do  difficulties in recruiting qualified and knowledgeable staff and in building locally relevant products and services  which could prevent us from aggregating a large advertiser base  higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  including different employment laws  trade barriers and unexpected changes and differences in regulatory  tax and legal requirements applicable to internet services  and longer payment cycles and foreign currency fluctuations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud  credit payment and sudden loss of advertisers we have suffered losses and may continue to suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data  even though the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders 
under current credit card practices  a merchant is liable for fraudulent credit card transactions when  as is the case with the transactions we process  that merchant does not obtain a cardholder s signature 
a failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions would result in significantly higher credit card related costs and may ultimately result in advertisers inability to use credit cards as a means of payment  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
some of our advertisers have limited operating histories  are operating at a loss  have limited cash reserves or have limited access to capital 
if an advertiser experiences financial difficulties  the advertiser may stop advertising suddenly 
in addition  in some instances we extend credit to advertisers who may default on their accounts receivable 
if any significant part of our advertiser base experiences financial difficulties  is not commercially successful or is unable to pay our advertising fees for any other reason  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement and other matters that could adversely affect our business our services operate in part by making internet services and content available to our users 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with third parties 
these claims might  for example  be made for defamation  negligence  copyright  trademark or patent infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or other legal theories 
allegations are made against us from time to time concerning these types of claims 
for example  we are in litigation with companies that have alleged that allowing advertisers to bid on certain search terms may constitute trademark infringement 
although we deny such allegations  any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a court were to determine that the sale of advertising related to certain search terms constitutes trademark infringement  it could negatively impact our revenues and business 
there can be no assurance that our services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to protect our internet domain name or intellectual property rights upon which our business relies our success and ability to compete also are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and data resources  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trade secret  patent and trademark law 
we also depend on our trade name and domain name 
we may not be able to adequately protect our technology and data resources 
in addition  intellectual property laws vary from country to country  and it may be more difficult to protect our intellectual property in some foreign jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services  technology and other intellectual property  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and advertisers 
we may need additional capital  which could dilute the ownership interest of investors we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or convertible debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock  and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
we experienced negative cash flow from operations from our inception through the first quarter of  and we could experience negative cash flow from operations in the future 
we currently anticipate that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditure through the foreseeable future 
however  we may choose to raise additional funds in the future 
potential acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results we may make investments in or acquire complementary products  technologies and businesses 
these acquisitions and investments could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
if we acquire a company  we could face difficulties in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
acquisitions of additional services or technologies also involve risks of incompatibility and the need for integration into our existing services and marketing  sales and support efforts 
if we finance the acquisitions by issuing equity securities  this could dilute our existing stockholders 
any amortization of intangible assets  or other charges resulting from the costs of these acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may pay more for an acquisition than an acquired product  technology or business is ultimately worth 
we also ceased operations of goto shopping  and we completed a management buyout of goto auctions  whereby the operating management of goto auctions purchased goto auctions assets from overture 
we have incurred charges related to the impairment of the assets acquired in connection with our exit from the auctions operations and comparison shopping operations  and incurred approximately million and million in net charges relating to our exit from the goto auctions and goto shopping operations  respectively in the year ending december  
table of contents our market may undergo rapid technological change and our future success will depend on our ability to meet the changing needs of our industry if new industry standards and practices emerge in the internet and online advertising industry  our existing services  technology and systems may become obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to license and internally develop leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective advertisers  consumers and businesses  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
government regulation and legal uncertainties may damage our business the laws and regulations applicable to the internet and our services are evolving and unclear and could damage our business 
there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to  or commerce on  the internet 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that internet laws and regulations may be adopted  covering issues such as user privacy  defamation  database protection  consumer protection  pricing  taxation  content regulation  quality of products and services  and intellectual property ownership and infringement 
such legislation could expose overture to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the internet  decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  or require overture to incur significant expenses in complying with any new regulations 
we may incur liabilities for the activities of users of our service the law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled and could damage our business 
our insurance policies may not provide coverage for liability for activities of our users 
overture may not successfully avoid civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users of our service 
the imposition upon overture of potential liability for unlawful activities of users of our service could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us  among other things  to spend substantial resources or to discontinue certain service offerings 
any costs incurred as a result of such liability or asserted liability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our charter documents and change of control severance agreements with our management will make it more difficult to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  with one class being elected each year by our stockholders  which generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of directors and obtain control of our board 
in addition  stockholder meetings may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board and the president  advanced notice is required prior to stockholder proposals  and stockholders may not act by written consent 
further  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for the board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of overture 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
specifically  section of the delaware general corporation law may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders 
we have entered into change of control severance agreements with members of our senior management and certain other key employees 
these agreements provide for certain benefits  including acceleration of option vesting  to these persons if they are terminated other than for cause following an acquisition of overture 
these agreements could make us less attractive to a third party who may want to acquire us  because they will make any replacement of management and other personnel more expensive 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overture is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations overture s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to overture s investment portfolio 
overture has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
overture invests its excess cash in high quality credit instruments  which are spread over many issuers 
overture s investments are principally confined to cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities 
overture s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the impact of changes in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
overture s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to overture s foreign sales subsidiaries 
overture is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on overture s results was not material
