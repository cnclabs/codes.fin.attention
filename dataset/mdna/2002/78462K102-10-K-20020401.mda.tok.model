item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the original statistical package for the social sciences was introduced in  and spss was incorporated in the first spss products were almost exclusively used by academic researchers working on mainframe computing systems 
spss subsequently transformed and enhanced its core product technology  broadened its customer base into the corporate and government sectors  significantly expanded its sales and marketing capabilities and product offerings  and adapted its products to changing hardware and software technologies 
spss has evolved in this manner through a combination of internal reorganization and acquisitions see business recent developments and business combinations for a description of each of spss s recent acquisitions 
approximately of revenues came from sales to customers in corporate settings  with another in academic institutions  in government agencies and from other sources 
in recent years  spss has experienced a significant shift in the sources of its revenues 
between and  revenues from its analytical solutions increased from to more than of total net revenues and showcase increased from to of total net revenues  while in contrast  revenue from spss statistical products and services declined from to of net revenues 
management expects these trends to continue in the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated historical financial information and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
results of operations the following table shows select statements of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the years indicated 
year ended december  net revenues analytical solutions market research statistics showcase net revenues operating expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative special general and administrative charges merger related acquired in process technology operating expenses operating income loss net interest and investment income expense other income expense income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income loss comparison of the years ended december   and net revenues 
net revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of from  and decreased to  in  an overall decrease of from the increase was primarily due to a growth in analytical solutions revenues of  as a result of increases in data mining products and sales  and b increases in showcase revenues of  primarily due to increases in new license revenues largely attributable to the expansion of the direct sales force and increases in maintenance and support revenues 
revenues in were negatively impacted by the deferral of revenues as required by aicpa technical practice aids regarding software revenue recognition that went into effect during the year 
the accounting change  as described in the following paragraph  resulted in a  reduction in net revenues in market research revenues declined in primarily due to the negative effects of the deferred revenue adjustment 
statistics revenue decreased in due to the deferred revenue adjustment and a lower overall growth rate in the market for general purpose statistical products 
the overall decrease in was made up of decreases in analytical solutions  statistics and showcase by  and  respectively  partially offset by a increase in market research revenues 
the decreases in analytical solutions  statistics and showcase were due to the general decline in business related it spending and a trend towards smaller transaction sizes  driven primarily by the downturn in the world economy  offset partially by increased revenues from server versions of spss products 
the decrease in statistics was primarily due to the divestiture of specific products and reduced demand driven by the economic downturn 
the increase in market research revenues resulted from new revenues related to the transaction with aol completed in the third quarter 
revenues in all categories were adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates for each of the three years described 
as noted above  during  the aicpa staff released several technical practice aids tpa for the software industry  consisting of questions and answers related to the financial accounting and reporting issues of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
as a result of the issuance of these tpa s  spss performed a comprehensive review of its revenue recognition policies to ensure compliance with recent authoritative literature 
on a prospective basis from the fourth quarter of  spss applied the standards in tpa fair value of pcs in a short term time based license and software revenue recognition and tpa fair value of pcs in perpetual and multi year time based licenses and software revenue recognition 
as a result of the application of the tpa s  spss began to recognize the revenue from short term time based licenses and perpetual licenses with multi year maintenance terms ratable over the term of the contract 
spss recorded a one time adjustment of approximately  to defer revenue for contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of costs of goods sold  amortization of capitalized software development costs  and royalties paid to third parties 
cost of revenues decreased from  in to  in  and increased to  in the increase was due to write offs of  of obsolete and redundant technology resulting from the showcase and netgenesis mergers which were required under gaap to be included in cost of revenue 
as a percentage of net revenues  cost of revenues were steady at in and  and increased to in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from  in to  in an increase of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in  and increased to in full implementation of the company s strategy of expanding sales management  recruiting additional  more senior sales representatives  and hiring more professional services personnel was limited in by the need to control costs due to the decrease in revenue  caused primarily by the downturn in the world economy  but is expected to continue to the extent economic conditions improve 
sales and marketing expense increases were partially offset by the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in and research and development 
research and development expenses increased from  in to  in and decreased to  in net of capitalized software development costs of  in   in and  in an increase of in and a decrease of in in the same periods  the company s expense for amortization of capitalized software and product translations  included in cost of revenues  was  in   in and  in as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were in  in and in the increase was due primarily to staff additions  salary increases  and recruiting expenses  while the decrease excluding amounts capitalized in research and development expenses was primarily due to ongoing cost control efforts  including limitations on hiring  travel  and other spending 
capitalization of software development costs increased during due to showcase related development projects 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in  and to  in  a decrease of in and in the decrease in was due to reduced costs by consolidating the united states accounting functions and lower bad debt expense  and the decrease was due to ongoing cost control efforts  including limitations on hiring  travel  and other spending 
this expense was steady as a percentage of net revenues at in  and special general and administrative charges 
special general and administrative charges were  for  or of revenues 
special general and administrative charges includes million of charges dating to the writedown of internal use software  million related to reductions in workforce  million for obsolete software writeoffs and other costs that did not meet the definition of merger costs  under established guidelines 
there were no special general and administrative charges in or merger related 
spss incurred merger related costs of  in and  in merger related expenses relate to several acquisitions during see note 
expenses included million paid for investment banking and other professional fees  million of deal related bonuses paid to employees  million of several costs and costs of closing excess office facilities and million for redundant software write offs 
included in merger related costs was a recovery of  against a previously taken charge related to a plan for consolidation of the company s facilities in the united kingdom 
acquired in process technology 
acquired in process technology costs were  in related to an acquisition of the verbastat software product from datastat  and  in related to the acquisition of netgenesis corp 
in december  spss acquired the verbastat software program  a software tool for computer aided coding of open ended survey questions  from datastat 
a portion of the purchase price was attributable to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with the program had not reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use 
spss assessed the fair value of the acquired in process technology using an income approach 
future cash flows were projected over five years discounted to present value using a discount rate of based on the project and the market risks associated with the research and development project and resulting product 
specific consideration was given to the stage of development of the research and development effort  which was complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
in projecting future revenue streams from the project  spss considered many factors including competition  market growth estimates  time to market and additional sales and marketing leverage that spss could provide to the verbastat product 
in december  spss completed a merger with netgenesis corp 
a portion of the purchase price was attributable to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with netgenesis version had not reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use

specific consideration was given to the stage of development of the research and development effort  which was complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
in projecting future revenue streams from the project  spss considered many factors including competition  market growth estimates  time to market and additional sales and marketing leverage that spss could provide to the netgenesis suite of products 
net interest and investment income expense 
net interest and investment income was  in   in and  in the net income in and was primarily due to interest earned on short term investments  partially offset by interest expense incurred on line of credit borrowings 
the expense in was due primarily to interest expense that was only partially offset by lower interest income due to lower average balances in cash and short term investments 
other income expense 
other income was  in and  in  and other expense was  in the large increase in was due primarily to the  gain on the divestiture of the statistical quality control product line  offset partially by foreign exchange transactions

during  the provision for income taxes represented a tax rate of approximately  excluding the effect of japanese monies transferred out of japan in the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance and nondeductible in process research and development charges 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   spss had approximately  of unrestricted cash and marketable securities 
cash received as part of the mergers with showcase and netgenesis were used to pay down the line of credit  accrued income taxes  the final installment to the former integral solutions shareholders  merger related costs and capital expenditures 
proceeds of approximately million were received from the issuance of common stock to siebel systems  inc in september summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of spss s contractual cash obligations less than total year years years after years united kingdom mortgage      purchase price payment verbastat   litigation settlement    merger consideration aol  undiscounted      capital lease commitments    other    summary disclosures regarding related parties spss maintains a consulting agreement with norman h 
nie consulting llc whereby spss receives consulting services on various business related matters 
annual compensation under the agreement is  plus expenses 
norman nie is the chairman of the board of directors of spss 
the agreement contains automatic one year extensions unless terminated by either party 
as described in note  spss purchased lexiquest in february norman nie was the chairman of the board of directors of lexiquest and owned less than of lexiquest common stock at the date of the acquisition 
bernard goldstein  a member of the board of directors of spss  serves as a director of broadview international  llc 
in  spss paid broadview a total of  as a retainer for investment banking services provided by broadview to spss 
in addition  spss paid broadview an additional  for services provided by broadview in connection with the merger of spss and netgenesis 
this  payment was made on january  we generated million in cash from operations in compared to million in and million in the and cash came primarily from our net income of million and million  respectively  while cash came primarily from collections of open accounts receivable of million  which was partially offset by the net operating loss 
investing activities resulted in the net use of million in cash in  million in and million in in  million in cash was primarily used for the expenditures for marketable securities  along with net capital expenditures of million and capitalized software development costs of million 
during  million in cash was used in net capital expenditures  along with million for capitalized software development costs and million in earn out payments to the former owners of isl  offset by million provided by net proceeds from marketable securities 
in  million in cash was used in net capital expenditures  along with million for capitalized software development costs and million in earn out payments to the former owners of isl and million related to the aol transaction  offset by million provided by net proceeds from marketable securities 
in addition  spss acquired cash of million as a result of its acquisition of netgenesis in december the company s capital expenditures  primarily for computer equipment and software  leasehold improvements and office furniture totaled approximately  in  and are projected to total approximately  in and  in spss expects capital expenditures during to include new computers  primarily for use in internal product development and systems for sales  accounting and order entry 
spss does not believe that the implementation of its business strategy will require substantial additional capital expenditures in comparison with historical capital expenditure levels which had consisted primarily of product development costs and other expenses 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in  while in million in cash was used in financing activities 
in  million was provided by the showcase initial public offering of common stock 
in  million was provided by borrowings under line of credit agreements and million was provided by issuances of common stock  mainly through employee exercises of stock options 
during  million in cash was used to repay borrowings under line of credit agreements  partially offset by million provided by issuances of common stock through sales to siebel and aol  and through employee exercises of stock options 
the company s accounts receivable balance increased  million in and million in the increase in related primarily to the increase in net revenues 
during  the company made considerable efforts to collect outstanding receivables including hiring additional collections personnel 
this  coupled with decreasing revenues  contributed to the significant decrease in net accounts receivable in the company s deferred revenue balance increased million in due primarily to the aforementioned  adjustment upon the implementation of the aicpa technical practice aids 
the relationship of the increase in accounts receivable in to the revenue decrease of in was caused by a combination of factors 
the first factor was the deferring of revenues in accordance with aicpa technical practices aids regarding software revenue recognition 
this application resulted in a  reduction in net revenues with no parallel reduction in accounts receivable 
the second factor was the timing of sales at the end of in the last month of  million was billed  compared to million in the same period of in may  spss revised its loan agreement with american national bank and trust company of chicago 
under the new loan agreement  spss has an available  unsecured line of credit with american national  under which borrowings bear interest at either the prime interest rate or the eurodollar rate  depending on the circumstances 
as of december   spss had  outstanding under this line of credit 
the company s agreement with american national requires spss to comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests  and  among other things  restricts the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations where spss is not the surviving entity  sell assets  engage in certain transactions with affiliates and amend its organizational documents or make changes in capital structure 
spss anticipates that amounts available from cash and cash equivalents on hand  under its line of credit  and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  no assurance can be given that changing business circumstances will not require additional capital for reasons that are not currently anticipated or that the necessary additional capital will then be available to spss on favorable terms or at all 
international operations significant growth in the company s international operations also occurred from to revenues from international operations comprised approximately to of total net revenues between and  and were approximately of total net revenues in following the reorganization of its international operations in  spss has maintained substantially the same direct sales and telesales organizations worldwide 
the international sales organization uses more independent distributors than the domestic sales organization  primarily in countries without an spss sales office 
management believes the profit margins associated with the company s domestic and international operations are essentially the same 
as international revenues increase  spss may experience additional foreign currency exchange risk 
to mitigate these effects  spss from time to time hedges its transaction exposure ie  the effect on earnings and cash flows of changes in foreign exchange rates on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency options  primarily yen 
spss does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
accordingly  the company s reported revenues and net income have been and in the future may be affected by the changes in foreign exchange rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates spss s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  and the valuation of accounts receivable  long lived assets and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
software revenue recognition the company applies aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which specifies the criteria that must be met prior to spss recognizing revenues from software sales 
spss s policy is to record revenue only when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists spss and the customer have executed a written agreement  contract or other evidence of an arrangement 
b delivery has occurred product has been shipped or delivered to customer  depending on the applicable terms 
spss s standard contract does not contain acceptance clauses 
in the event that spss modifies the terms of its standard contract to provide that final delivery is contingent upon the customer accepting the applicable product  spss does not recognize revenue for that product until the customer has accepted the product 
c the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable the arrangement indicates the price of the license and the number of users  and the related payment terms are within one year of delivery of the software 
d collectibility is probable spss sells to customers it deems creditworthy 
standard terms for payment are days 
spss periodically extends payment terms to three to six months  but does not extend payment terms past one year 
spss primarily recognizes revenue from product licenses  net of an allowance for estimated returns and cancellations  at the time the software is delivered 
revenue from certain product license agreements is recognized upon contract execution  product delivery  and customer acceptance 
revenue from postcontract customer support pcs or maintenance agreements  including pcs bundled with product licenses  is recognized ratably over the term of the related pcs agreements 
some product licenses include commitments for insignificant obligations  such as technical and other support  for which an accrual is provided 
revenue from training  consulting  publications  and other items is recognized as the related products or services are delivered or rendered 
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting as services are performed to develop  customize and install the company s software products 
the percentage completed is measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date in relation to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
management considers labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
spss enters into arrangements which may consist of the sale of a licenses of the company s software  b professional services and maintenance or c various combinations of each element 
revenues are recognized based on the residual method under sop  modification of sop software revenue recognition  when an agreement has been signed by both parties  delivery of the product has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable and no other significant obligations remain 
historically  the company has not experienced significant returns or offered exchanges of its products 
for multiple element arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and spss allocates a portion of the total fee under the arrangement to the undelivered elements  such as professional services  training and maintenance based on vender specific objective evidence of fair value 
revenues allocated to the undelivered elements are deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license  under the residual method 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price the customer is required to pay when the element is sold separately ie hourly time and material rates charged for consulting services when sold separately from a software license and the optional renewal rates charged by the company for maintenance arrangements 
if an element of the license agreement has not been delivered  revenue for the element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue is deferred until sufficient objective evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
amounts allocated to license revenues under the residual method are recognized at the time of delivery of the software when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  if any  and all the other revenue recognition criteria discussed above have been met 
revenues from professional services are comprised of consulting  implementation services and training 
consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and include services such as installation and building non complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in customized environments 
services are generally separable from the other elements under the arrangement since the performance of the services is not essential to the functionality ie the services do not involve significant production  modification or customization of the software or building complex interfaces of any other element of the transaction 
revenues for professional services and training are recognized when the services are performed 
maintenance revenues consist primarily of fees for providing when and if available unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term 
maintenance revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
spss offers a annual licenses with maintenance renewable annually  b perpetual licenses with both annual and multi year maintenance  and c multi year licenses with multi year maintenance 
vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for annual licenses with one year of maintenance 
for perpetual license arrangements with one year of maintenance  vendor specific objective evidence is established based on the renewal rate of maintenance which is a set percentage of the total contract price  in accordance with technical practice aids tpa  fair value of pcs with a consistent renewal percentage  but varying dollar amounts  and software revenue recognition 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is not determinable for perpetual and multi year arrangements with multi year maintenance 
spss licenses software  primarily to end users  on a perpetual basis and on an annual and multi year basis 
under a perpetual license  the customer is granted an indefinite right to use the software 
spss has a day return policy for these types of licenses and the company calculates its return allowance using a month rolling average based on actual returns during the prior months 
under an annual license  the customer is granted the right to use the software for one year and may not return or cancel during the first year 
for each type of license  postcontract customer support maintenance is offered 
under perpetual licenses  it is the customer s option to renew maintenance each year 
under an annual license  the customer must renew the license and maintenance to continue to use the software 
in both cases  spss contacts the customer two months before the scheduled renewal date to determine the customer s renewal intentions 
if the customer indicates that it intends to renew the license  spss will issue a new invoice 
in some cases  customers ultimately cancel a license even though they initially indicated a willingness to renew 
these cancellations are tracked in a month rolling average to determine the cancellation percentage that spss will accrue as its cancellation allowance 
capitalization of certain software development costs software development costs incurred by spss in connection with the company s long term development projects are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
spss has not capitalized software development costs relating to development projects where the net realizable value is of short duration  as the effect would be immaterial 
spss reviews capitalized software development costs each period and  if necessary  reduces the carrying value of each product to its net realizable value 
as of january   spss adopted sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this standard requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage and post implementation operations stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
during  and  spss capitalized   and  respectively  and amortized   and  respectively  of internal use computer software 
accounts receivable spss s management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
spss performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s credit worthiness  as determined by spss s review of their current credit information 
spss continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  spss cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
if the financial condition of spss s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets spss assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors spss considers important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for spss s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when spss determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  spss would use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable over its estimated useful life 
if estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired and an expense is recorded in an amount required to reduced the carrying amount of the asset to its then fair value 
income taxes spss recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
spss regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while spss has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event spss were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should spss ascertain in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized in excess of the net deferred tax assets recorded  all or a portion of the  million valuation allowance would be reversed as a benefit to the provision for income taxes in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
and subsequently  sfas no 
after its adoption 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of july   and sfas no 
is effective january  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june   but before sfas no 
is adopted in full  are not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continued to be amortized and tested for impairment prior to the full adoption of sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company is required to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new classification criteria in sfas no 
for recognition separate from goodwill 
the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
if an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an intangible asset with an indefinite life 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement requires the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  the company will then have up to six months from january  to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of operations 
as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
 the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  including workforce of  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense related to goodwill was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
and no 
 it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting the statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities that have legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of a long lived asset 
statement no 
also requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
enterprises are required to adopt statement no 
for fiscal years beginning after june  early adoption is encouraged 
the company has not yet determined the impact of the new accounting standard on its financial reporting 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
the new standard supercedes fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
 the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the new standard also supercedes the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period s in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements beginning after december   but allow for early application 
the provisions of sfas no 
generally are to be applied prospectively  therefore  the adoption of this standard will not affect previously reported financial information 
the company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting standard to have a material effect on its financial reporting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under our unsecured line of credit that bears interest at either the prime rate or the eurodollar rate 
as of december   the company had  outstanding under this line of credit 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional  of annual interest expense  assuming the same level of borrowing 
the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
since a substantial portion of the company s operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  the company s results can be significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations to currency exchange rates  the company  from time to time  enters into various financial instruments  such as options 
these instruments generally mature within months 
gains and losses on these instruments are recognized in other income or expense 
were the foreign currency exchange rates to depreciate immediately and uniformly against the us dollar by percent from levels at december   management expects this would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company operates internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  the company utilizes option contracts to minimize the impact of currency movements on receivables from its foreign subsidiaries
