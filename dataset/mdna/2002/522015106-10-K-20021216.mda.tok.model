overview learning tree is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training to information technology it professionals working in business and government organizations 
since its founding in  learning tree has provided high quality training to over million it professionals 
in fiscal  learning tree provided training to over  course participants 
approximately two thirds of learning tree participants come from fortune level companies  their international equivalents and government organizations  and approximately one third come from small and medium size companies 
learning tree offers a broad  proprietary library of intensive four and five day instructor led courses  comprising different course titles representing over  hours of training at september  learning tree courses focus on client server technology  operating systems  programming languages  intranet internet web applications  computer networks  computer and network security  databases  software engineering  object oriented technology and it management 
as a vendor independent provider of it training  learning tree designs its own courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective of software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors in a single course 
learning tree uses a well defined  systematic approach in developing and updating its course library to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
learning tree courses are highly interactive and are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
learning tree s courses are recommended for one to two semester hours of college credit by the american council on education  and are accepted for college credit at the university of phoenix 
learning tree s proprietary course development process also allows it to customize its courses for delivery at its customers sites 
learning tree offers its proprietary courses through local operations in the united states  united kingdom  france  canada  sweden  japan and hong kong  and generates approximately half of its revenue internationally 

table of contents each learning tree operating subsidiary is staffed by local nationals responsible for delivery of learning tree courses in that country 
learning tree s infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow it to coordinate  plan and deliver its courses at learning tree s education centers  hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal  learning tree presented courses in countries 
over the years since its founding  learning tree has experienced a number of periods of challenging economic conditions 
learning tree has generally tried to use those periods to grow its market share  so that it would be able to achieve even stronger growth during the better economic times that followed 
learning tree is confident in the long term outlook for the it industry and the need for it training  because it believes that the core growth drivers for information technology and for its business remain unchanged 
in our knowledge economy  learning tree believes that information technology is itself a primary driver for productivity and product improvements that fuel growth 
as a result  learning tree believes that information technology provides mission critical resources that can be used by every organization to gain a competitive advantage 
learning tree believes that its business will continue to be influenced by world events  by the economy  and by spending trends in the corporate marketplace for information technology 
the timing of a recovery in spending on technology and it remains uncertain and learning tree has yet to see any discernable improvement in demand from its customers 
therefore  learning tree continues to believe that it is prudent to operate its business based on an assumption that revenues adjusted for seasonal fluctuations will not increase until both the general economy and the it industry begin to improve 
accordingly  learning tree expects to continue to maintain its reduced level of operating costs in accordance with its revenue expectations 
see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree has structured its business so that the majority of its instructor led course costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
learning tree schedules its course events throughout the year based on its assessment of demand 
since learning tree s instructors typically work full time in the it industry and teach learning tree course events as needed  learning tree s instructor related costs are largely variable 
learning tree s expenses associated with its own education centers are largely fixed 
however  learning tree can moderate its overall facility expenses to some extent by varying its use of rented hotel and conference facilities 
in addition  learning tree has the ability to control some of its expenses  based on its expectations of future customer demand and other factors  by adjusting the number of new course titles it develops and the size of its direct mailing campaigns 
during fiscal  learning tree reduced the number of its worldwide staff  and refined its marketing efforts for improved effectiveness  which allowed it to reduce the magnitude of its sales and marketing expenditures 
at the same time  learning tree enhanced the quality levels in its core strengths its expert instructors  its proprietary content library  its state of the art classrooms and its worldwide course delivery systems 
learning tree believes that this will help it take advantage of the economic improvement when it comes 
however  predicting when the recovery will begin is difficult  particularly given the continuing instability of the international situation 
learning tree intends to continue monitoring business conditions throughout its current markets  as well as potential new markets 
if the domestic and or international economy were to weaken further  many companies may continue to reduce spending on external it training 
if this should happen  it could have a material and adverse impact on learning tree 
learning tree has engaged in limited development and testing of internet based e learning course formats and packages 
learning tree has yet to find what it believes could be a profitable and sustainable e learning business model and may or may not be successful developing an e learning product line 
as a result  learning tree expects to limit its investment in e learning research and development

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes learning tree s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s revenues decreased by to million from million in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million versus million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal revenues 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decline in the number of instructor led course participants 
during fiscal  learning tree trained a total of  instructor led course participants  a decrease of from the prior year s  participants 
learning tree believes that the decrease in the number of course participants is primarily the result of the slowdown in the it industry and the overall economy  which has resulted in more cautious spending by its customers on it training 
for fiscal  revenues reflect a decrease in average revenue per course participant primarily because of a larger portion of course participants attending under multiple course discount programs compared to the prior fiscal year 
about half of learning tree s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  which are translated into us dollars for financial reporting 
accordingly  exchange rate fluctuations impact learning tree s reported revenues 
see exhibit  risk factors 
in fiscal  exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant effect on revenues because the impact of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year were offset by improvements in foreign exchange rates in the second half of the fiscal year 
cost of revenues 
learning tree s cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel and living expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
the cost of revenues for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this decrease reflects a decrease in the number of course events during fiscal  partially offset by a increase in 
table of contents cost per event compared to fiscal during fiscal  learning tree presented  instructor led course events compared to  events in fiscal in fiscal  the cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal the change in gross profitability of learning tree s instructor led courses primarily reflects a decrease in revenue per course event compared to the prior year 
revenue per course event primarily reflects a decrease in the average number of attendees per event 
in addition  revenue per course event reflects the aforementioned decrease in average revenue per attendee 
learning tree believes that the decrease in the average number of attendees per event primarily reflects the impact of current economic conditions  which lowered learning tree s overall attendance rates 
the change in learning tree s gross profitability also reflects a increase in learning tree s average cost per course event 
the increase in the average cost per course event primarily reflects the impact of the lower utilization of learning tree s education centers arising from the decrease in the number of course events conducted in fiscal  as well as the impact of other fixed costs being spread over fewer events 
the increase was partially offset by reduced spending on instructor training and recruiting and a reduction in the use of rented hotel and conference facilities 
course development expenses 
learning tree maintains a disciplined process to develop new courses and update its existing courses 
the costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred  and are included in course development expenses 
course development expenses also include all costs of learning tree s e learning development activities 
in fiscal  course development expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal course development expenses as a percentage of revenues  reflect lower revenues  partly offset by a decline in absolute expenditures on course development 
course development expenses decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in the number of new course titles developed during fiscal while maintaining the level of expenditures for updating existing courses 
during slower economic periods  it hardware and software vendors typically introduce fewer new products  thus requiring the development of fewer new it courses 
in addition  the reduction in course development expenses reflects a decrease in spending on e learning development 
during fiscal  learning tree released additional course titles on topics such as windows xp and  sql server  oraclei  xsl  uml  visual basic 
net  asp 
net  ado 
net  and it management 
at the end of fiscal  learning tree offered different course titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared to titles a year earlier 
the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate are not sufficient to justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their technological content 
learning tree expects to have approximately course titles in the first quarter of fiscal the actual number of course titles which learning tree will produce  and their delivery dates  are subject to the rate of new technological developments and perceived customer demand 
thus learning tree may or may not develop more titles than it retires in any period 
course development costs may increase in the future if learning tree expands its instructor led course library or its expenditures on e learning 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  the costs of designing  producing and distributing direct mail marketing and media advertisements  and the costs of information systems to support these activities 
for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal the increase was a result of lower revenues  partly offset by lower sales and marketing expenses 
during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million from million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects the results of initiatives to adjust marketing expenditures and sales personnel based on 
table of contents current operating levels  as well as a reduction in selling commissions 
learning tree generally has the ability to adjust its expenditures for sales and marketing depending on its expectations of future customer demand  market conditions  strategic objectives and other factors 
however  if the expectations prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on learning tree s results of operations 
general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects the effect of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  partially offset by an increase in it staff and related expenses  and staff salary adjustments 
other income expense 
other income expense is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal  other income expense decreased to million of income from million in fiscal primarily because of million lower interest income which was partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in interest income reflects lower interest rates together with the decline in the amount of learning tree s interest bearing investments because of expenditures for repurchases of its common stock 
learning tree recorded foreign exchange losses of  in fiscal compared to foreign exchange losses of  in fiscal these losses arose from receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of learning tree s foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes 
in fiscal  learning tree s income tax provision decreased to million from million in fiscal  as a result of lower taxable income 
learning tree operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries 
each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
since taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and tax rates vary from country to country and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  learning tree s consolidated effective tax rate may vary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic segments 
learning tree has education centers in six countries around the world  and has historically derived approximately half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal reflects decreased revenues in all locations 
the united states recorded revenues of approximately million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal revenues from europe were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to declines in the united kingdom and sweden 
canada recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal  and asia recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although learning tree s consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  several of learning tree s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of learning tree s subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on learning tree s results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on learning tree s foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on learning tree s foreign expenses 
the impact of future exchange rates on learning tree s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore continues to be subject to such risks 
in the future  learning tree may undertake such transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations

recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in fiscal  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 
table of contents  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  and sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
learning tree believes that these statements will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s revenues increased by to million from million in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million versus million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal revenues 
during fiscal  learning tree trained a total of  instructor led course participants  an increase of from the prior year s  participants 
the increase in course participants in fiscal was primarily the result of better market conditions for it training during the first half of the year coupled with an increase in expenditures for course development  sales and marketing 
during the second half of fiscal  the number of course participants declined from prior year levels 
this reflected the economic slowdown in the it industry  which learning tree believes resulted in more cautious spending by its customers 
in addition  the disruption of learning tree s courses in the united states due to the attacks of september reduced revenues by approximately million 
the increase in course participants during fiscal was largely offset by a adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
excluding the impact of the exchange rate changes  the average revenue per course participant would have increased by compared to fiscal overall  had exchange rates in fiscal remained the same as they had been during fiscal  revenues in fiscal would have been approximately million  or greater than revenues in fiscal in the past  in addition to its instructor led courses  the company has delivered certain of its courses by using a computer based training method cbt on cd roms 
since the sales of cbt courses were largely discontinued at the end of fiscal  learning tree s fiscal revenues also reflect the reduction of cbt revenues 
cost of revenues 
in fiscal  the cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal the change in gross profit in learning tree s instructor led courses reflected an decrease in revenue per course event and a increase in the average cost per course event 
in addition  the cost of revenues increased as a percent of revenues in part because of the reduction in relatively high margin cbt sales during fiscal learning tree s revenue per course event reflected a decline in the average number of attendees per event and the change in average revenue per attendee 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  margins were also adversely affected as a direct result of courses disrupted by the september attacks  since learning tree lost much of the revenue from these courses while saving only a small portion of the related course costs 
learning tree s average cost per course event increased because of increased instructor training and recruiting activities and increased facilities costs associated with the expansion of the new york  chicago and atlanta education centers and an increase in lease rates for the reston education center 
the increased cost per course event was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes  the cost per course event would have been higher than for the prior year 
the cost of revenues for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase reflected a increase in the number of course events during fiscal and the increase in cost per course event compared to fiscal during fiscal  learning tree presented  instructor led course events compared to  events in fiscal 
table of contents course development expenses 
in fiscal  course development expenses were of revenue compared to in fiscal course development expenses increased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the increase primarily reflected an increase in the number of new course titles developed during fiscal  as well as a modest increase in learning tree s investment in e learning 
at the end of fiscal  learning tree offered different course titles  comprising a total of  hours of training  compared to titles a year earlier 
the increase in the number of titles in fiscal reflected the net effect of the introduction of new titles and the retirement of titles 
sales and marketing expenses 
for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased by to million from million in fiscal the increase primarily reflected increased marketing activities and marketing costs to support the increased revenues during the first half of the year  and to build market share in the second half 
general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses reflected increases in administrative staff and related costs  partly offset by decreases in incentive compensation costs 
other income expense 
in fiscal  other income expense decreased to million of income from million in fiscal primarily because of lower interest income and foreign exchange losses 
during fiscal  learning tree used approximately million of its cash to repurchase common stock 
the resulting decline in interest bearing investments  together with lower interest rates in the marketplace caused interest income to decline by  in fiscal compared to fiscal learning tree recorded foreign exchange losses of  in fiscal compared to foreign exchange losses of  in fiscal these losses arose from receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of learning tree s foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes 
in fiscal  learning tree s income tax provision decreased to million from million in fiscal  as a result of lower taxable income  partially offset by a slight increase in the effective tax rate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic segments 
the increase in revenues in fiscal reflected increased revenues in both europe and the united states

the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as the frequency and availability of course events  the number of weeks in a quarter during which courses can be conducted  the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of  and response to learning tree s direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  the timing of the introduction of new course titles  the mix between course events held at customer sites  and course events held in learning tree s education centers and hotels  competitive forces within current and anticipated future markets served by learning tree  learning tree s ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  
table of contents currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism  and other external factors  and general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results may also occur as a result of differences in the timing of learning tree s spending on development and marketing of its courses and receiving revenues from its customers 
see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree s quarterly revenues and income typically reflect seasonal patterns 
generally  learning tree s revenue and operating income are greater in the second half of its fiscal year april through september than in the first half october through march 
this is due in large part to seasonal spending patterns of learning tree s customers  which are affected by matters such as their budgetary considerations  factors specific to their business or industry  and weather  holiday and vacation considerations 
however  the effects of periods of rapid acceleration or deceleration of revenues can offset these seasonal effects 
there can be no assurance that these seasonal factors or their effects will remain the same in the future 
revenues for the second half of fiscal reflect the economic slowdown in the it industry 
further  the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal reflect the disruption of learning tree s courses in the united states caused by the attacks of september liquidity and capital resources learning tree s cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september   from million at september  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflects repurchases of common stock  asset acquisitions related to learning tree s education center in paris  and investments in new and upgraded course equipment  partially offset by cash provided by operations and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
during fiscal  learning tree repurchased approximately  shares of its common stock for approximately million 
in addition  trade accounts payable at the end of fiscal included million required to settle common stock repurchases made at the end of fiscal that were settled during the first few days of fiscal as a result  during fiscal learning tree paid approximately million in cash for common stock repurchases 
from october   through december   learning tree repurchased an additional  shares of its common stock for million 
learning tree may make additional purchases through open market transactions  but has no commitments to do so 
cash provided by operations for fiscal was approximately million compared to million for fiscal excluding the effects on current liabilities of the fiscal stock repurchases which were paid in fiscal  cash provided by operations was approximately million compared to million during fiscal this change primarily reflects the changes in profitability  advance payments by customers for future courses and reductions in accounts payable  partially offset by lower income tax payments 
at september   learning tree had a net working capital balance of million 
during fiscal  learning tree invested million in equipment and facilities compared to million in fiscal the investments in the current year primarily relate to purchases of course equipment and the build out of a second education center in paris  france  which opened in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  learning tree increased the number of its classrooms in paris from to the higher level of investment during the prior year was primarily related to the build out of expanded education center facilities in new york city and stockholm  sweden  the opening of two new education centers in chicago and atlanta  and the purchase of new and upgraded course equipment 
although learning tree expects to continue to invest in additional equipment in fiscal  as of september   learning tree had no material future purchase obligations  capital commitments or debt 
accordingly  learning tree believes its cash and cash equivalents and the cash provided by its operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in the future  learning tree may use cash for acquisitions 
while learning tree has no current agreements in place or negotiations underway with respect to any acquisition  learning tree may  on occasion  evaluate acquisition opportunities that appear to fit within its overall business strategy 
learning tree has had no significant experience in executing and implementing acquisitions and no assurance can be given as to the success of learning tree in executing and implementing acquisitions in the future 
see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree has not paid any cash dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations is based upon learning tree s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of learning tree s accounting policies 
learning tree s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of learning tree s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that learning tree believes are the most important to the portrayal of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
course events range from three to five days  with an average of approximately four days 
for individual course enrollments  it is learning tree s policy to recognize revenues and the related direct costs of course events as courses are delivered on a straight line basis 
however  for administrative purposes  the revenues and the related costs of course events are recorded upon commencement of each course event 
the difference between learning tree s revenue recognition policy and recording revenues and related course costs on a straight line basis is inconsequential 
learning tree offers its customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a training passport 
a training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of a training passport  learning tree records the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and the training passport selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average actual number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate utilized by learning tree 
if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for all active training passports and for all training passports sold thereafter is adjusted 
learning tree believes it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to more closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of its passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passport 
learning tree believes that the use of historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by the tens of thousands of passport holders since the inception of the program in fiscal although learning tree has seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has increased  it monitors such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 

table of contents learning tree also offers a multiple course sales discount referred to as training vouchers 
under learning tree s training vouchers  the customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher expires unused  learning tree records the selling price of the expired training voucher as revenue 
prepaid marketing expenses 
prepaid marketing expenses are charged to income in the month in which the advertising materials are mailed since the benefit period for such costs is short and the amount of such future benefit is not practically measurable 
course development costs 
course development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred 
foreign currency 
learning tree translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the local functional currencies to united states dollars in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the rates of exchange at each fiscal year end are used for translating the balance sheets and the average monthly rates of exchange for each year are used for the statements of operations 
gains or losses arising from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of stockholders equity 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risk associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and therefore continues to be subject to such risk 
facilities  intangible and other long lived assets 
equipment  property and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
learning tree periodically reviews the carrying value of its facilities  intangible and other long lived assets to identify and assess any impairment of the carrying value 
facilities leases 
learning tree leases its facilities under various operating lease agreements 
certain provisions of these leases provide for cash incentives  graduated rent payments and other inducements 
learning tree recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis  which more closely reflects the benefits received 
the value of any lease incentives or inducements  along with the excess of the rent expense recognized over the rentals paid is recorded as deferred facilities rent charges in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
learning tree applies sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  in accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from carryforwards and from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the book basis of such assets and liabilities as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets arise from expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods 
deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amounts that will be realized from future profitability and can be predicted with reasonable certainty 
deferred income tax liabilities represent taxes the company expects to pay in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook for fiscal throughout this document  there have been various forward looking statements 
however  this entire section should be treated as forward looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those detailed from time to time in learning tree s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in exhibit  risk factors 
as economic and market conditions change during fiscal  learning tree s future revenues  plans and expenditures will vary from the observations below  and these differences may be material 

table of contents backlog 
at september   learning tree had a backlog of orders for instructor led courses of million  which represented a decrease compared to the backlog of million at september  at october   learning tree had a backlog of orders for instructor led courses of million  which represented a decrease compared to the backlog of million at october  only a portion of learning tree s backlog is funded 
there can be no assurance that orders comprising the backlog will be realized as revenue 
recent trends 
learning tree believes that its business will continue to be influenced by world events  the economy and spending trends in the corporate marketplace for information technology 
the timing of a recovery in spending on technology and it remains uncertain and learning tree has yet to see any discernable improvement in demand from its customers 
therefore  learning tree continues to believe that it is prudent to operate its business based on an assumption that revenues adjusted for seasonal fluctuations will not increase until both the general economy and the it industry begin to improve 
accordingly  learning tree expects to continue to maintain its reduced level of operating costs in accordance with its revenue expectations 
effect of exchange rates 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars  and fluctuations in exchange rates will impact future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if current exchange rates remain stable through the remainder of fiscal  revenues in the first quarter would be favorably impacted by approximately  and revenues for the fiscal year would be favorably impacted by approximately  compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal conversely  foreign currency denominated expenses would be unfavorably impacted by the same percentages in these periods 
first quarter revenues 
a number of factors may influence learning tree s revenues in the first quarter of fiscal these include the following at september   learning tree s backlog was lower than at september  a month later  at october   learning tree s overall backlog was lower than at october  also at october   revenues for october courses plus backlog for courses in november and december was lower than at october  if exchange rates remain stable through the remainder of the first quarter  revenues would be favorably impacted by approximately 
this effect is already partly reflected in learning tree s backlog 
learning tree expects to have approximately course titles in the first quarter of fiscal compared with course titles in the first quarter of the prior year 
based on these factors and learning tree s current assessment of general economic conditions  learning tree believes that revenues in the first quarter of fiscal will be in the range of million to million 
this would be to lower than revenues of million in the first quarter last year and would be similar to revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal first quarter gross margin 
learning tree expects several factors to cause a net decline in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal of approximately to compared with the same quarter last year learning tree has been working to improve its procedures for course scheduling in the current environment  which is intended to increase attendees per event and thereby improve revenue per event 
while this remains a challenging goal in the current economic climate  learning tree expects to achieve a slightly higher number of attendees per event in the first quarter of fiscal than it realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  although slightly lower than in the first quarter of last year 
learning tree expects continued low utilization rates of its education centers  which would result in higher fixed costs per event in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the same period last year  although slightly better than during its fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents first quarter operating expenses 
learning tree expects overall operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal to be equal to or slightly higher than those for the fourth quarter of fiscal this reflects the effects of pay rate increases received by non managerial staff  sales commissions  and accruals for incentive compensation which will only be paid to the extent targets are achieved in the coming year

based upon these factors  learning tree expects operating expenses to be approximately million to million in the first quarter of fiscal first quarter interest income

outlook for fiscal over the years since its founding in  learning tree has experienced a number of periods of challenging economic conditions 
generally  learning tree has tried to use those periods to grow market share  so that it would be able to achieve even stronger growth during the better economic times that followed 
predicting macroeconomic and industry specific trends is inherently difficult  particularly given the instability of the international situation 
therefore  learning tree believes it is prudent to manage its business on the assumption that revenues in fiscal will continue at approximately the same levels as those in fiscal  at least until the economic recovery begins 
at the same time  learning tree intends to continue focusing on improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations 
if fiscal revenues remain in line with those of fiscal  learning tree s recently achieved improvements in operating efficiency should produce somewhat higher profitability 
however  business conditions and the international situation could change for the better or the worse  causing learning tree to adjust its expenditures in relation to changing revenue expectations

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk learning tree s cash equivalents are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions 
the fair value of learning tree s portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a percent basis point increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
learning tree does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
learning tree s consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while the operations of its foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
consequently  changes in exchange rates can result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rates on learning tree s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted

in the future  learning tree may undertake such transactions 
however  any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations
