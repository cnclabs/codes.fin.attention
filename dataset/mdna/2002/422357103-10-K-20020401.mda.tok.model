it is not expected that future cost of sales ratios for real estate other than development projects and home sales will change materially from ratios experienced in prior years  as the balance of heartland s real estate other than development projects consists primarily of railroad properties acquired over the past years at values far lower than current fair values

as of december   heartland had designated sites  or approximately acres with a book value of approximately  for development 
capitalized expenditures at these sites were  in   in and  in at december   capitalized costs on development properties including housing inventories totaled  expenditures which significantly increase the value and are directly identified with a specific project are capitalized 
at december   land held for sale consists of  acres with a book value of  it will be disposed of in an orderly fashion 
it is anticipated that it will extend beyond the year to dispose of most of these properties 
it is the company s practice to evaluate environmental liabilities associated with the company s properties 
heartland monitors the potential exposure to environmental costs on a regular basis and has recorded a liability in the amount of  at december  and  at december  for possible environmental liabilities  including remediation  legal and consulting fees 
a reserve is established with regard to potential environmental liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of any liability is determined independently from any claim for recovery 
if the amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated  but management is able to determine that the amount of the liability is likely to fall within a range  and no amount within that range can be determined to be the better estimate  then a reserve in the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if the company were to use a different approach  the reserve could be materially higher 
however  estimates can be affected by various uncertainties including future changes in technology  changes in regulations or requirements of local governmental authorities  third party claims  the scope and cost to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that may be shared and the timing of the remediation work 
at december   there is not sufficient information to reasonably estimate all the environmental liabilities of which management is aware 
accordingly  management is able to determine whether environmental liabilities which management is unable to reasonably estimate will or will not have a material effect on heartland s results of operations or financial condition 
as additional information becomes available  the company will reassess its reserves which may then be modified and related charges credits against earnings may then be made 
in addition  heartland has established an allowance for resolution of non environmental claims of  at december  and  at december  heartland does not at this time anticipate that these claims or assessments will have a material effect on the company s liquidity  financial position and results of operations beyond the reserve which the company has established for such claims and assessments 
in making this evaluation  the company has assumed that the company will continue to be able to assert the bankruptcy bar arising from the reorganization of its predecessor and that resolution of current pending and threatened claims and assessments will be consistent with the company s experience with similar previously asserted claims and assessments 
while the timing of the payment of environmental claims has not significantly adversely effected the company s cash flow or liquidity in the past  management is not able to reasonably anticipate whether future payments may or may not have a significant adverse effect in the future 
notwithstanding  at december   there is not sufficient information to reasonably estimate all the environmental liabilities of which management is aware 
accordingly  management is unable to determine whether environmental liabilities which management is unable to reasonably estimate will or will not have a material effect on heartland s results of operations or financial condition 
at december   hti owed heartland and cmc approximately  on february   the company and cmc demanded immediate payment in full of all obligations due under the line of credit promissory notes from hti 
heartland has initiated steps to protect its security interest in the class b limited partner interest the collateral 
pg oldco  inc  a creditor of hti under notes aggregating  in principal amount  also has a security interest in the collateral and has commenced steps to protect its interest 
under the lien subordination and inter creditor agreement inter creditor agreement among heartland  cmc  pg oldco  inc and hti  heartland and cmc have a first and prior security interest in the collateral and the proceeds thereof up to the senior debt priority amount as defined in the inter creditor agreement and pg oldco  inc has a first and prior security interest in the collateral and the proceeds thereof for all amounts in excess of the senior debt priority amount 
because of the competing interests in the collateral  heartland is not at this time able to predict the ultimate outcome of its efforts to protect its interests in the collateral or the effect thereof on the class a limited partners 
nevertheless  management believes the note receivable of  is recoverable through the company s security interest in the class b limited partner interest 
heartland s management believes it will have sufficient funds available for operating expenses  but anticipates the necessity of utilizing outside financing to fund development projects 
as of december   the company had a line of credit with lasalle national bank lnb in the amount of  cash in the amount of  is pledged as an interest reserve 
heartland has also granted lnb  as collateral for the line of credit  a first lien on certain parcels of land in chicago  illinois  milwaukee  wisconsin and fife  washington 
the company has also pledged as collateral its interest in the goose island joint venture 
the net worth requirement for the line of credit is  advances against the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate of lnb plus at december  
at december    had been advanced to heartland by lnb against the line of credit 
the loan matured february  the company is currently in negotiations with lnb to increase the loan amount and extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit 
while the company has no reason to believe the increase in the loan amount and extension of the credit facility will not be approved by lnb  there can be no assurance the contemplated increase and extension will be given 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain any adjustments to reflect the ultimate outcome of this uncertainty 
at december   the company had capital and operating lease obligations of the following total capital leases    operating leases      model home rent two officers of heartland     total      results of operations for the year ended december   operations resulted in a net income of  or per class a unit 
operations for the years ended december  and resulted in a net income of  or per class a unit and a net loss of  or per class a unit  respectively 
the difference in net income in compared to the net income in of  is due to a decrease in sales volume 
net income in  compared to the net loss in  increased  due to a substantial increase in sales volume 
total operating expenses for were  compared to  for and  for the decrease of  in compared to is primarily due to decreased general and administrative expenses of  economic and other conditions generally the real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by changes in national  global and local economic conditions and events  such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  consumer confidence and the demand for housing and other types of construction 
real estate developers are subject to various risks  many of which are outside the control of the developer  including real estate market conditions  changing demographic conditions  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as hurricanes and tornadoes  delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in government regulations or requirements  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees and availability and cost of land  materials and labor 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions of heartland 
access to financing the real estate business is capital intensive and requires expenditures for land and infrastructure development  housing construction and working capital 
accordingly  heartland anticipates incurring additional indebtedness to fund their real estate development activities 
as of december   heartland s total consolidated indebtedness was  this amount is due within one year from january  there can be no assurance that the amounts available from internally generated funds  cash on hand  heartland s existing credit facilities and sale of non strategic assets will be sufficient to fund heartland s anticipated operations 
heartland may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including additional bank financing and sales of debt or equity securities 
no assurance can be given that such financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to heartland 
if heartland is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund the implementation of its business strategy and other expenditures  development projects may be delayed or abandoned 
any such delay or abandonment could result in a reduction in sales and would adversely affect heartland s future results of operations 
period to period fluctuations heartland s real estate projects are long term in nature 
sales activity varies from period to period  and the ultimate success of any development cannot always be determined from results in any particular period or periods 
thus  the timing and amount of revenues arising from capital expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty 
the inability of heartland to manage effectively their cash flows from operations would have an adverse effect on their ability to service debt  and to meet working capital requirements 
interest rate sensitivity the company s total consolidated indebtedness at december   is  the company pays interest on its outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities and fixed loan amounts at prime or the prime rate plus and at a fixed rate of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
an adverse change of in the prime rate would increase the yearly interest incurred by approximately  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic and other conditions and interest rate sensitivity
