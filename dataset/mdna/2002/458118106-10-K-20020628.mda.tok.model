item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we recommend that this discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to operating results  new product introductions and sales  competitive conditions  capital expenditures and resources  manufacturing capacity utilization  customer demand and inventory levels  protection of intellectual property  and the risk factors set forth in the section factors affecting future results 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements  which are generally identified by words such as anticipate  expect  plan  and similar terms  include statements related to revenues and gross profit  research and development activities  selling  general  and administrative expenses  amortization of intangibles  interest income and other  taxes  capital spending and financing transactions  as well as statements regarding successful development and market acceptance of new products  industry and overall economic conditions and demand  and capacity utilization 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable in the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies  including those related to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk and income taxes  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record reserves for obsolete and excess inventory based on our forecasts of demand over specific future time horizons 
actual market conditions and demand levels in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecasts  potentially impacting our inventory reserves and resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review the impairment of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
such impairment reviews require us to estimate useful lives and future cash flows  and actual results may vary from our expectations 
in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge related to our salinas wafer manufacturing plant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april   we are required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment assessment in fiscal and at least annually thereafter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these assessments will be performed on a discounted cash flow basis  using management s estimates of revenues and expenses over a multi year horizon 
overview after achieving record results in fiscal  in fiscal idt posted operating results that were significantly lower  principally because of a decline in world economic conditions and a resulting sharp drop in global demand for semiconductors 
slower economic conditions in our customers end markets were compounded by our customers response curtailing all non essential component purchases so as to reduce the level of inventories carried and improve their cash flow 
across all customer channels  geographies  and product segments  the difficult business environment we experienced in fiscal was in significant contrast to fiscal the contrast was especially pronounced for semiconductors serving communications applications because of the tremendous build out of communications infrastructure networks which had occurred up to and through idt s fiscal as economic conditions weakened during fiscal  global capital spending for the communications infrastructure equipment that our customers sell was reduced significantly because of the extent of technology and capacity additions in recent prior years 
the extent of economic uncertainty worldwide and the corresponding impact on our customers end markets proved far greater than originally forecast by both our customers themselves and the semiconductor industry as a whole 
in percentage terms  recent revenue declines experienced by the segment of the semiconductor industry which serves communications applications have been amongst the highest of any semiconductor industry segment 
during the later part of fiscal  the extent of the impact of deteriorating economic and market conditions  including the incremental impact of unforeseeable world events  and the extent of the resulting change in our customers demand  became more fully understood 
we therefore determined that it was necessary to position the company to operate profitably at the lower revenue levels currently available in our end markets 
throughout the fiscal year  we maintained controls on hiring  capital expenditures  and discretionary spending 
in the first and third quarters of fiscal  we implemented reductions in force throughout our manufacturing and non manufacturing organizations  and we exited fiscal with headcount reduced by approximately  or  from the peak employment levels reached in fiscal finally  early in our fourth fiscal quarter  we announced the planned closure of our older wafer manufacturing facility in salinas  calif  and the consolidation of all our internal wafer fabrication at our hillsboro  ore  site 
key research and development programs were maintained throughout fiscal  and largely as a result of our acquisition of newave semiconductor newave  the personnel resources dedicated to product design and engineering increased 
we preserved a strong financial position  ending the year with little debt and million in cash and investments excluding equity investments 
finally  fiscal ended on a positive note  with the fourth quarter of fiscal marking the first sequential increase in quarterly revenues since the third quarter of fiscal results of operations revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to the previous year 
for the reasons described above  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  industry wide demand for communications equipment started to decline 
as noted  global economic conditions have a direct impact on demand in our customers markets and broadly weaker economic conditions across multiple industries and geographies affected capital spending trends  to which our customers are sensitive 
the trend towards weaker global economic conditions and reduced customer demand existed throughout most of fiscal in all of our sales channels distributors  contract manufacturers or cems  and direct customers or oems 
our customers also reacted to changes in end market conditions by taking steps to reduce their finished goods  work in process and component inventories 
this industry wide trend significantly decreased demand for our products in both of our product segments the communications and high performance logic segment  which includes fifos and multi ports  communications applications specific standard products assps and high performance logic and clock management devices  and the sram and other segment 
our unit sales volumes during fiscal dropped by almost from those in fiscal  and this was the primary cause of our revenue decline 
as global capacity to produce integrated circuits exceeded demand  average selling prices per unit asps came under pressure in fiscal this was particularly true for products we sell where multiple sources exist  such as in our srams and other segment 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million compared to fiscal the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased unit volumes and higher average selling prices in both of our product segments the increase in volume for the communications and high performance logic segment was mainly attributable to the introduction of new products  primarily for data networking and wireless communications infrastructure equipment markets  as well as high levels of demand for existing products serving these and other markets 
unit volumes for our srams and other segment also improved from fiscal to fiscal  due to high levels of demand for industry standard products 
improvements in the mix of units sold  and in the level of demand for industry standard products related to available supply  resulted in a higher asp in fiscal compared to the preceding year 
revenues recent trends 
consistent with what we observe to be stabilizing or improving economic and market conditions in early calendar  the levels of unit demand and revenues for our products have improved 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our revenue grew over the immediately prior quarter to reach million 
however  customers continue to delay placing committed purchase orders and to demand that products be delivered on very short lead times  resulting in low levels of backlog 
this current lack of order visibility  together with continuing uncertain conditions in the economies  markets  and customers that we serve  make it difficult to predict the rate of future growth in our revenue 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal our gross margin for was compared to for fiscal the decline in gross profit in fiscal year was primarily attributable to lower revenues and the corresponding reduced levels of utilization of fixed manufacturing infrastructure 
in comparison to fiscal  gross profit was adversely impacted by the reduced number of units sold  reductions in carrying value of excess inventories recorded during the period  and by lower asps  particularly for our products that have multiple sources 
in addition  we incurred asset impairment million and retention and other expenses million related to winding down and exiting the salinas facility  restructuring charges million  related principally to headcount reductions in salinas and throughout the company  and amortization of intangible assets attributable to existing technology related to our acquisition of newave million 
for further discussion on these items  see amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges  asset impairment and other below 
these pressures were partially offset by reductions in manufacturing spending  including lower depreciation expenses  lower variable spending on assembly and test operations  related to reduced business volumes  and lower personnel expenses related to facility shutdowns  and to the headcount reductions we implemented at our manufacturing facilities in the first and third quarters of fiscal as was the case in fiscal  average gross margin for products within the srams and other segment was significantly below our overall gross margin during fiscal gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
from fiscal to  our gross profit increased by million 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was 
factors that contributed to the improvement in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal include higher unit volumes and revenue  increased manufacturing capacity utilization  improved product mix within the communication and high performance logic segment  higher sram and logic product pricing  and manufacturing cost reductions 
the latter included the sale of a wafer fabrication facility located in sydney  australia and the negotiation of significantly lower subcontractor prices for assembling certain of our products 
special items impacting gross profit in fiscal included million in intel licensing revenue  which carried little related costs  and million in net positive adjustments and reversals 
the latter adjustments occurred as we finalized the accounting for certain restructuring activities that had commenced in fiscal  but were not completed until fiscal for fiscal  we expect that while the closure of our salinas manufacturing facility will have a positive impact on gross margin percentage  significant improvement in quarterly gross margin percentage will remain primarily dependent on whether business conditions continue to improve and support sequential revenue growth 
restructuring charges  asset impairment and other 
we recorded million in asset impairment and restructuring charges during fiscal  primarily because of poor business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
of this amount  million was recorded as cost of goods sold  the remainder  as operating expenses 
in the first and third quarters of fiscal  we recorded million in expenses related to restructuring actions  consisting mainly of worldwide reductions in force in our manufacturing and administrative organizations 
such expenses in the first quarter of fiscal were recorded as cost of goods sold million and operating expenses million 
expenses in the third quarter of fiscal were recorded as cost of goods sold million and operating expenses million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we performed impairment reviews of our manufacturing facilities 
principally because of the age and limited capability of the facility to produce technologically competitive products going forward  we determined that future undiscounted cash flows related to our older wafer fabrication facility located in salinas would not be sufficient to recover the carrying values of the assets in that facility 
we accordingly wrote down the assets to their fair values on the basis of appraisals and management estimates  resulting in a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal in january  we announced a plan to consolidate our wafer fabrication manufacturing operations 
under the plan  production at the salinas facility will be phased out during the first quarter of fiscal  and approximately manufacturing and support positions will be eliminated 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million in restructuring expenses  primarily related to severance and other termination benefits  in connection with this plan 
in addition to the million in expenses specifically identified as asset impairment and restructuring charges  we incurred million in other expenses related to the salinas plan  mainly for retention bonuses 
we expect to incur additional costs of approximately to million associated with closure of this facility  most of which will be recorded during the first half of fiscal beginning in july  after the salinas facility is closed  we expect to realize manufacturing cost savings of approximately to million per quarter as a result of this facility consolidation 
research and development 
for fiscal  research and development r d expenses totaled million  and were essentially flat with the million incurred in fiscal r d expenses increased by million from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  we added significant design and engineering resources in our communications and high performance logic segment through our acquisition of newave in april in addition to higher operating expenses associated with the newave design team  we also incurred million in expenses during fiscal for newave related contingent compensation and stock based compensation amortization 
cost allocations to r d related to new product development and depreciation expense associated with r d equipment also increased 
these expense increases were offset by a combination of lower profit sharing and other performance related personnel costs and continued control over discretionary spending 
in fiscal  r d spending increased by million over the prior year  to million 
this increase in r d expenses was related to increased spending for product  process  and applications r d to support the growing communications and high performance logic product segment and  to a much lesser extent  the srams and other segment 
factors contributing to the spending growth included higher personnel and profit dependent costs  increased expenditures on contract design services  the expansion of our design centers in georgia  texas  and australia  and higher cost allocations to r d from our manufacturing infrastructure related to new product introductions 
we expect that in fiscal  r d expense will remain flat in absolute dollars from fiscal s levels 
new product development efforts will continue to be focused in such areas as fifos and multi ported communications products  networking and switching products  ip co processors incorporating cam content addressable memory technology  timing and clock products  integrated communications processors  and telecommunications products  including those which provide gateways for voice traffic over the internet 
we are continuing to develop advanced manufacturing process technologies designed to enable performance advantages and to enhance production efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative 
during fiscal  selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses declined by million to million 
in fiscal  sg a spending had risen by million from the prior year  to million 
the decrease in sg a expenses from fiscal to fiscal relates primarily to lower personnel related costs and continued control over discretionary spending 
personnel related costs declined due to headcount reductions implemented throughout the year and the absence of profit dependent personnel expenses such as management bonuses and employee profit sharing expenses 
other revenue dependent expenses such as sales incentives and outside sales commissions were also lower 
we also reduced other discretionary operating expenses such as recruiting  advertising  travel and other outside services  in response to the weak business environment 
the increase for sg a expenses in fiscal over fiscal was mainly the result of higher profit and revenue dependent personnel expenses 
while we expect to continue to control discretionary spending into the new fiscal year  the absolute dollar level of sg a expenses  especially those associated with variable selling costs  may increase in fiscal  particularly if we realize increased revenues 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of newave  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d in fiscal the million allocation of the purchase price to ipr d was determined by identifying technologies that had not attained technological feasibility and that did not have future alternative uses 
estimated future revenues were allocated to in process and existing technology  and appropriate estimated expenses were deducted and economic rents charged for the use of other assets 
based on this analysis  a present value calculation of estimated after tax cash flows attributable to the technology was computed 
amortization of intangibles 
during fiscal  goodwill related to the newave transaction was amortized to expenses in accordance with an estimated useful life of seven years using the straight line method 
other identified intangibles were amortized over estimated useful lives of two to seven years  also using the straight line method 
as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amortization of certain intangibles  primarily goodwill  will cease on april  as a result  we expect amortization of intangibles to decrease by million in fiscal also in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 idt is required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment assessment within six months of adoption  or by the end of our second quarter of fiscal our preliminary analysis indicates that this assessment is likely to result in a partial impairment charge against the goodwill we carry related to the newave acquisition 
merger expenses 
we incurred million in merger expenses in fiscal related to our acquisition of qsi  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
gain on equity investments  net 
during the fiscal period  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded various gains and losses in connection with our equity investment holdings in pmc sierra  inc pmc and monolithic system technology mosys 
these gains and losses are summarized as follows in thousands in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal gain on exchange of qed shares  realized gains on sales of qed shares  realized gains losses on sales of pmc shares  realized gains on sales of mosys shares  other than temporary impairment charges  gains on equity investments  net    as of march   we continued to hold approximately  shares of pmc 
our pretax  unrealized loss associated with these holdings was million 
interest expense 
for fiscal  interest expense decreased by million in comparison to fiscal the decrease is due mainly to the payoff of a mortgage and certain leases and  to a lesser extent  the conversion of substantially all of our convertible subordinated notes to common stock in fiscal q see note to the consolidated financial statements 
primarily as a result of the conversion  interest expense decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal our remaining interest bearing liabilities consist mainly of secured equipment financing agreements  which amortize over the terms of the agreements 
interest income and other  net 
changes in interest income and other  net are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income    other income  net    interest income and other  net    interest income declined by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to lower average interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower average investment balances 
the increase in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher cash and investment balances  which grew as a result of cash generated from operations 
other income  net  in fiscal includes a pre tax gain of million related to our exercise of an option to purchase land adjacent to our wafer manufacturing facility in hillsboro 
immediately following the option exercise  we sold most of the underlying property and recognized the gain 
other income  net for fiscal included net gains of million primarily related to the sale of our x design subsidiary and related intellectual property  and a gain of million on the sale of our san jose fabrication facility 
other income  net  for fiscal also includes a loss of million related to our equity interest in clear logic  inc provision for taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of 
this rate of benefit varied from the federal statutory rate mainly due to the effects of non deductible acquisition related costs and foreign losses 
in fiscal  our tax rate was  which included the effects of deferred gains on investments  the reversal in fiscal of most of the valuation allowance reserve recorded against our net deferred tax assets  and the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we enjoy certain tax benefits in malaysia and the philippines  mainly as a result of tax holidays and certain investment incentives 
we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately for fiscal  exclusive of merger related items and other non deductible items  such as restructuring costs 
our estimate is based on existing tax laws and our current projections of income and distributions of income among different tax entities  and is subject to change 
liquidity and capital resources our financial condition remains strong 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments  excluding our shares of pmc  were million at march   a decrease of million compared to april  net cash used for operating activities was million in fiscal our operating activities provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
lower operating results were the main cause of the decline in cash flows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal other factors included lower accounts payable balances and decreased deferred income on shipments to distributors due to lower levels of distributor channel inventory  decreased accrued compensation due to payouts of profit dependent personnel expenses accrued in fiscal and paid in fiscal  and decreased income taxes payable 
we used million  million and million for investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
among the major uses of cash for fiscal was million for the newave acquisition 
we curtailed spending on capital in fiscal  and expenditures decreased to million for the year compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
sales of maturing investments  net of purchases  provided million in fiscal as compared to million used for net purchases of investments in fiscal in fiscal  we received million in proceeds from the sale of property  principally our san jose wafer fabrication facility 
we used million for financing activities in fiscal our financing activities used million in fiscal and provided million for fiscal significant financing activities in fiscal and fiscal included repurchases of common stock million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee option and purchase plans million accounted for most of the cash provided by financing activities 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  depending upon business conditions  to be financed primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
in addition  we are considering terminating the synthetic lease related to our hillsboro  ore  manufacturing site see note to the consolidated financial statements 
should we decide to terminate the lease  we would exercise our option to purchase approximately million in additional fixed assets  with most of the purchase price approximately million funded by amounts already pledged to collateralize the lease  and the balance approximately million funded by existing cash and investments 
a summary of our contractual cash payment obligations and commitments as of march  is presented below in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal operating leases      capital leases     purchase commitments  total      we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal and we may investigate other financing alternatives  however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
factors affecting future results our operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
for example  we had net income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal fluctuations in operating results can result from a wide variety of factors  including timing of new product and process technology announcements and introductions from us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  particularly in the sram market  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix of products sold  availability and costs of raw materials  and of foundry and other manufacturing services  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and industry wide wafer processing capacity  political and economic conditions in various geographic areas  changes in demand for our products in the markets we serve  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  or other litigation 
in addition  many of these factors also impact the recoverability of the cost of manufacturing  tax  goodwill and other intangibles and other assets 
as business conditions change  future writedowns or abandonment of these assets may occur 
further  we may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors  and our operating results could be harmed by increased competition 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in overall economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
should economic conditions deteriorate  domestically or overseas  our sales and business results could be harmed 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry exacerbates the volatility of our operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
market conditions characterized by excess supply relative to demand and resultant pricing declines have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
such pricing declines adversely affect our operating results and force us and our competitors to modify capacity expansion programs 
as an example  in prior years  a significant increase in manufacturing capacity allocated to industry standard sram components caused significant downward trends in pricing  which adversely affected our gross margins and operating results 
we are unable to accurately estimate the amount of worldwide production capacity dedicated to or planned for the industry standard products  such as sram  that we produce 
our operating results can be adversely affected by such factors in the semiconductor industry as a material increase in industry wide production capacity  a shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with our products  and reduced demand or other factors that may result in material declines in product pricing 
although we are continuing to try to reduce our dependence on revenue derived from the sale of industry standard products  and while we carefully manage costs  these efforts may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effect the above or other industry related factors can have on our results 
demand for our products depends on demand in the communications  and to a lesser extent  computer markets 
the majority of our products are incorporated into customers systems in enterprise carrier class network  wireless infrastructure and access network applications 
a percentage of our products  including high performance logic components  serve in customers computer storage  computer related  and other applications 
customer applications for our products have historically been characterized by rapid technological change and significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for most of our products  and therefore potential increases in revenue  depends upon growth in the communications market  particularly in the data networking and wireless telecommunications infrastructure markets and  to a lesser extent  the computer related markets 
any slowdown in these communications or computer related markets could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  when all channels of distribution are considered  one customer in the communications market  cisco systems  inc  represents more than of our total revenues 
our product manufacturing operations are complex and subject to interruption 
from time to time  we have experienced production difficulties  including reduced manufacturing yields or products that do not meet our or our customers specifications  that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
while production delivery delays have been infrequent and generally short in duration  we could experience manufacturing problems  capacity constraints and or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  complexity of manufacturing processes  changes to our process technologies including transfers to other facilities and die size reduction efforts  and ramping production and installing new equipment at our facilities 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters 
we have wafer fabrication facilities in hillsboro  ore 
and salinas  calif  and assembly and test facilities in the philippines and malaysia 
we have announced plans to phase out production at the salinas facility  but a significant portion of our total revenues in fiscal is expected to be derived from products manufactured in salinas  which is located near a major earthquake fault 
once the closure of our salinas facility is completed  we expect that over of our revenues will be derived from silicon fabricated at our hillsboro facility 
if we were unable to use our facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  our operations would be materially adversely affected until we were able to obtain other production capability 
we do not carry earthquake insurance on our california facilities or related to our business operations  as we do not believe that adequate protection is available at economically justifiable rates 
we are dependent upon electric power generated by public utilities where we operate our manufacturing facilities 
utility power interruptions can occur at any time in any location 
we have periodically experienced electrical power interruptions in the philippines and california because utilities in these geographies have failed to provide an adequate power infrastructure 
we maintain limited backup generating capability  but the amount of electric power that we can generate on our own is insufficient to fully operate these facilities and prolonged power interruptions at any of our locations could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
we do not maintain insurance coverage that would help protect against the impact of power interruptions  because we do not believe that such coverage is available on cost effective terms 
as part of our plan to phase out manufacturing operations in salinas  we intend to redesign certain high volume products and transfer their wafer manufacturing to hillsboro 
if we experience production difficulties  insufficient or inappropriate mix of inventories  quality problems or delivery delays associated with transferring production  our operating results could be adversely affected 
historically  we have utilized subcontractors for the majority of our incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than at our own malaysian and philippines assembly and test operations 
we expect to continue utilizing subcontractors to supplement our own production volume capacity 
due to production lead times and potential subcontractor capacity constraints  any failure on our part to adequately forecast the mix of product demand could adversely affect our operating results 
our results are dependent on the success of new products 
new products and process technology associated with the hillsboro fabrication facility will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
if we are unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to or better than our current products  our future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages used by us require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to us due to capacity constraints 
our results of operations would be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business and operations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend by companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
we have been involved in patent litigation in the past  which adversely affected our operating results 
although we have obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  we do not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers that have broad patent portfolios 
claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights have been asserted against us and could be asserted against us in the future 
these claims could result in our having to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  incur significant litigation costs and damages  and develop non infringing technology 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses on favorable terms  or the inability to obtain a key license  could adversely affect us 
international operations add increased volatility to our operating results 
a substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from international sales  as summarized below percentage of total revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal americas asia pacific japan europe total in addition  our assembly and test facilities in malaysia and the philippines incur payroll  facility and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our cost of goods sold  as well as both pricing and demand for our products 
our offshore manufacturing sites and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability and acts of war or terrorism  which could disrupt our manufacturing activities  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions  and changes in tax laws  import and export controls  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for subcontract assembly services  can also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we also purchase certain semiconductor manufacturing tools  such as photolithography equipment  from overseas vendors 
prices for such tools are typically quoted in foreign currencies and may equate to several million us dollars per unit 
although we seek to mitigate currency risks through the use of hedge instruments  currency exchange rate fluctuations can have a substantial impact on our net us dollar cost for these tools 
global economic and political factors  including terrorism  could harm our business 
weak economic conditions  terrorist actions  and the effects of ongoing military actions against terrorists could lead to significant business disruptions 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and other regulations related to hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to control the use or discharge of hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility 
such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of idt  other semiconductor companies  or our customers 
announcements by us or by our competitors regarding new product introductions may also lead to volatility 
in addition  our stock price can fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  especially in the technology sector 
stock price volatility may also result from changes in perceptions about the various types of products we manufacture and sell  which employ a variety of semiconductor design technologies and include both proprietary or limited source products and industry standard or multiple source products 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market price of our investment in pmc sierra  inc we currently hold approximately  common shares of pmc sierra  inc pmc 
the pmc stock  which we acquired in connection with pmc s merger with quantum effect devices qed see note to the consolidated financial statements  is highly volatile 
the amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from this investment in future periods cannot be determined at this time and may vary materially from the current unrealized amount 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired companies 
we acquired newave semiconductor corp 
newave in fiscal and may pursue other acquisitions in the future 
failure to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business could adversely affect our results of operations 
integration risks and issues may include  but are not limited to  personnel retention and assimilation  management distraction  technology development  and unexpected costs and liabilities 
in addition  we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements and are required to perform a transitional impairment assessment of newave related goodwill in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and approximately of our investment portfolio at the end of fiscal had maturities of less than two years 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  a hypothetical move in interest rates would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we mitigate the credit risk to our investment portfolio through diversification and for  debt securities  adherence to high credit rating standards 
we have minimal interest rate risk with respect to debt  our balance sheet at march  includes only million in debt 
the synthetic lease related to our manufacturing facilities in hillsboro has variable  london interbank offered rate libor based payments 
however  this lease is collateralized with investment securities that have similar  and thus offsetting  interest rate characteristics 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of international sales  assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  and capital purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to help manage our foreign currency exchange exposures 
we do not enter in derivatives for trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for both fiscal and and determined that a change in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant near term impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
