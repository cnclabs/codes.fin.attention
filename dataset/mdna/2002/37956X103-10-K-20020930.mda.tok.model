item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as  among others  the decline in demand for our services and products due to economic and industry specific conditions  the risks associated with operating in international markets and our dependence on a limited number of contracts for a high percentage of our revenue 
these risks and others are more fully described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview since our inception  a majority of our revenues have been generated by ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions business 
contracts for these ground segment systems and networks and communications services have been fixed price contracts in a majority of cases 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since our business is frequently concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contract costs generally include purchased material  direct labor  overhead and other indirect costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized in the period identified 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions consist primarily of the costs of purchased materials  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel  living costs and subcontractor salaries 
costs from data communications services consist primarily of satellite space segment charges  internet connectivity fees  network operations expenses and depreciation 
satellite space segment charges consist of the costs associated with obtaining satellite bandwidth the measure of capacity used in the transmission of services to and from the satellite leased from operators 
network operations expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the operation of the network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis  including personnel and related costs 
depreciation relates to a capitalized transponder lease and the network operations center 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to engineers 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our management  finance  contract and administrative functions 
our business has been adversely affected by the current global economic slowdown and  in particular  the significant challenges facing the telecommunications industry worldwide 
these challenges include excess bandwidth resulting from weak consumer and business demand  which has fallen far short of expectations  and the attendant financial distress facing both traditional telecommunication carriers and the new generation of competitive local exchange carriers 
moreover  as a result of the uncertainties facing the economy  corporations have seriously restricted their capital expenditures to those that are absolutely necessary 
the reduction in demand has been accompanied by significant pricing pressures and intensifying competition  while the financial difficulties of industry participants and customers have created risks associated with collectibility of accounts receivable 
we have experienced a decline in bookings of contract orders as customers and prospects delay projects 
these negative trends are expected to continue to impact our business and prospects for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies require judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  for our production type contracts that are sold separately as standard satellite ground segment systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  delivery has occurred and the contractual performance specifications have been met 
our standard satellite ground segment systems produced in connection with these contracts is typically short term less than twelve months in term and manufactured using a standard modular production process 
such systems require less engineering  drafting and design efforts than our long term complex production type projects 
revenue is recognized on our standard satellite ground segment systems upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing which is when title transfers to the customer 
the amount of revenues recorded on each standard production type contract is reduced by the customer s contractual holdback amount  which typically requires to of the contract value to be retained by the customer until installation and final acceptance is complete 
the customer generally becomes obligated to pay to of the contract value upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the system since installation does not require significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment  does not require complex software integration and interfacing and we have not experienced any difficulties installing such equipment 
in addition  the customer or other third party vendors can install the equipment 
the estimated relative fair value of the installation services is determined by management  which is typically less than the customer s contractual holdback percentage 
if the holdback is less than the fair value of installation  we will defer recognition of revenues  determined on a contract by contract basis equal to the fair value of the installation services 
payments received in advance by customers are deferred until shipment and are presented as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  for our non standard  complex production type contracts for the production of satellite ground segment systems and equipment that are generally integrated into the customers satellite ground segment network 
the equipment and systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically long term in excess of twelve months in term and require significant customer specific engineering  drafting and design effort in order to effectively integrate all of the customizable earth station equipment into the customers ground segment network 
these contracts generally have larger contract values  greater economic risks and substantive specific contractual performance requirements due to the engineering and design complexity of such systems and related equipment 
progress payments received in advance by customers are netted against the inventory balances 
revenues from data communications services are derived primarily from internet access service fees 
service revenues from internet access are recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided 
payments received in advance of providing internet access services are deferred until the period such services are provided and are presented as deferred revenues 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions costs related to our production type contracts and our non standard  complex production type contracts rely on estimates based on total expected contract costs 
we use reasonable  dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various elements 
since these contract costs depend on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revision in cost estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
in the event an estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred at completion  we record the costs in the period identified 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired primarily from the buyback of the minority interests of netsat 
in the fiscal year ended june  with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
in assessing goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the goodwill associated with netsat is impaired 
any resulting impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist primarily of work in progress from costs incurred in connection with specific customer contracts  which are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make estimates of the total contract costs based on the various elements of the work in progress 
it is possible that changes to these estimates could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of our inventories 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions decreased by million  or from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease relates to the decrease in the shipment and or completion of contracts as a result of a decline in bookings of contract orders due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economic slowdown in the telecommunications industry  resulting in customers and prospects continuing to delay projects 
we expect the trend in revenues that adversely affected our results of operations for the fiscal year june  to continue to adversely impact us 
revenues from data communications services 
revenues from data communications services decreased by million  or from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease reflects changes in market conditions including the global economic slowdown in the telecommunications industry  pricing pressures in the marketplace and penetration of fiber into areas we have traditionally provided services 
we expect the trend in revenues that adversely affected our results of operations for the fiscal year june  to continue to adversely impact us  coupled with the termination of services from our largest middle east customer in august costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions decreased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease is attributable to a lower revenue base 
costs as a percentage of related revenues decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was mainly attributable to a change in contract mix 
costs from data communications services 
costs from data communications services increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  costs as a percentage of related revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily due to an increase in transponder costs due to the reclassification of certain satellite transponders leased to operating leases from capital leases based on the renegotiation of certain long term lease agreements during the fiscal quarter ended june  the corresponding decrease was in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was attributable to a reduction in work force in the sales and marketing department of our data communications services business in the fiscal quarter ended june   partially offset by the development of a new direct sales force in the ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions business 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was attributable to internal development of new monitoring and control technologies  as well as the initial development of various subsystems for solutions we are providing to a new customer 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  primarily resulted from the recording of a million allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from our largest middle east customer  an increase in legal expenses  mainly related to settling a patent infringement case and an increase in insurance premiums  partially offset by a reduction in work force  including the reduction of the management team of our data communications services business  which took place in the fiscal quarter ended june  asset impairment charge 
the asset impairment charge of million for the fiscal year ended june   related to three cost basis investments that were written down in the fiscal quarter ended june  our management evaluated these investments and believed it would be appropriate to write down these investments to zero based on their financial uncertainty 
the asset impairment charge of million for the fiscal year ended june   related to a write down of the net carrying value of goodwill relating to the acquisition of a wireless local loop telephone network solutions business during the fiscal year ended june  restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge of million of which was charged to costs from data communications services for the fiscal year ended june  relates to management s plan to reduce costs and improve the data communications services business operating efficiencies 
as a result of this restructuring  we terminated employees including executive management  marketing  administration and operations support personnel 
the major components of the restructuring charge included severance payments to terminated employees of approximately million  fees incurred in connection with the termination of certain leased satellite transponders of approximately million charged to costs from data communications services  the write off of certain capitalized costs in the amount of approximately million associated with our terminated financing activities and the write off of the estimated book value of equipment in the amount of approximately million in connection with our discontinuance of certain product lines 
at june   approximately million of the restructuring charge was accrued and included in other accrued expenses 
during the fiscal year ended june   the restructuring plan was completed whereby million was charged against the restructuring accrual for charges related to space segment cancellation fees  and million was reversed into income credit to costs from data communications services due to the resolution of liabilities for less than originally estimated 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease is primarily due to significant decline in interest rates coupled with a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to cash used in operations during the fiscal year ended june  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was due to the reclassification of certain satellite leased transponders to operating leases from capital leases based on the renegotiation of certain long term lease agreements during the fiscal quarter ended june  the corresponding increase was in costs from data communications services during the fiscal year ended june  gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investment of million for the fiscal year ended june   related to the sale of our interest in one of our investments  which was accounted for as a cost method investment  during the fiscal quarter ended december  fiscal years ended june  and revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions

costs as a percentage of revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to a change in contract mix 
costs from data communications services 
costs from data communications services increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase related to additional satellite space segment transponder costs and the expansion of the network operations center to support the increasing service base 
costs as a percentage of revenues decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues  which increased transponder utilization 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is attributable to our data communications services business increase in sales and marketing efforts to penetrate into new regions

gain on sale of consolidated subsidiary s common stock 
the gain on sale of consolidated subsidiary s common stock of million for the fiscal year ended june  related to our sale of  shares of common stock of our data communications services business at per share during the fiscal quarter ended december  gain on sale of investment 
the gain on sale of investment of million in the year ended june   relates to the sale of our interest in one of our investments  which is accounted for as a cost method investment  during the fiscal quarter ended december  quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited consolidated financial information for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended june  we believe that this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the annual report on form k  and we believe all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
certain balances in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation

see risk factors beginning on page liquidity and capital resources at june   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  net accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  offset by million in accounts payable  million in deferred revenue and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended june  was million  which primarily related to the net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million relating to the timing of vendor payments and a decrease in deferred revenue of million due to the timing of advance payments from customers on contracts  offset by a decrease in inventories of million due to the completion of certain jobs  a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to collections on certain contract billings and the reduction in revenues  a provision for doubtful accounts of million mainly attributable to a million allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from one customer and depreciation and amortization expense of million related to the network operation center and one satellite space segment transponder 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million  which relates to the purchase of million in fixed assets primarily for satellite earth station equipment and our network operations center in order to support our service base and million for advances to certain offices 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million  which primarily related to the repurchase of  shares of stock from an officer 
effective april   we amended our bank agreement and established a million working capital line of credit 
the modified credit facility bears interest at the prime rate at june  and is collateralized by a first security interest on most of our assets 
the credit facility  which expires on april   contains certain financial covenants  with which we were in compliance at june  as of june   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility  however  there are outstanding standby letters of credit  bid proposals and performance guarantees of approximately million which are applied against and reduce the amounts available under the working capital line of credit 
we lease satellite space segment services and other equipment under various operating lease agreements  which expire in various years through future minimum lease payments due on these leases through june  are approximately million 
on november   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby we can repurchase up to million of our outstanding stock  representing approximately of the total shares outstanding on that date 
on november   we repurchased  shares at a fair market price of per share on such date 
on may   the company repurchased  shares at a fair market price of per share from an officer of the company 
the timing  price  quantity and manner of future purchases will be at the discretion of management  depending on market conditions and other factors  subject to compliance with the applicable securities laws 
we expect that our cash and working capital requirements for operating activities will increase as we continue to implement our business strategy 
management anticipates that we will experience negative cash flows due to continued operating losses as a result of a decrease in orders and continued under utilization of satellite transponder space of netsat 
netsat has had  and we expect it will continue to have  significant working capital requirements  which have  and will  put increased pressure on our capital resources 
we are currently exploring a number of alternative strategies to reduce the drain on our resources caused by netsat s losses 
these include strategies to better utilize  or reduce the cost of underutilized  transponder capacity  as well as strategies to deal with netsat s funding needs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully achieve our goal of improving netsat s working capital requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our marketing efforts in the ground segment systems  networks  and communications services business  the nature and timing of customer orders  the extent to which we must conduct research and development efforts internally and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements through june  however  we cannot assure you that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
for example  the terrorist attacks on the united states in  as well as future events occurring in response to  or in connection with them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against the united states or its allies or military or trade or travel disruptions impacting our ability to sell and market our products and services in the united states and internationally may impact our results of operations 
additional funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel and our research and development activities 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june   the company had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years capital lease obligation      operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      total amounts amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments committed less than year years years over years standby letters of credit  performance guarantees total commercial commitments   related party transactions during the fiscal year ended june   we advanced  and  to a vice president and our general manager  respectively 
we received two promissory notes payable on december  for such advances  which bear interest at an annual rate of payable quarterly 
during the fiscal year ended june   we increased the  loan to  and amended the promissory note accordingly 
at june   principal amounts outstanding under these promissory notes were included in other assets and accrued interest receivable thereon were included in other current assets 
at june   principal amounts and accrued interest outstanding under these promissory notes were included in other current assets 
during the fiscal year ended june   we advanced  to our chief executive officer 
we received a promissory note payable on september  which bears interest at an annual rate of payable quarterly  and secured by a stock pledge agreement 
on may   our chief executive officer sold  shares of common stock at a fair market price of per share on such date in connection with our stock repurchase program 
we deducted amounts outstanding on the promissory note together with accrued interest thereon from the gross proceeds paid to our chief executive officer in connection with this transaction 
during the fiscal year ended june   we advanced  to our president 
we received a promissory note payable on september   which bears interest at an annual rate of payable quarterly  and secured by a stock pledge agreement 
at june   principal amounts outstanding under this promissory note were included in other assets and accrued interest receivable thereon were included in other current assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 was issued  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
risk factors we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow and expect our losses to continue 
we have incurred significant net losses since we began operating in august we incurred net losses of million during the fiscal year ended june   million during the fiscal year ended june  and million during the fiscal year ended june  as of june   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend upon our ability to generate significant revenues through new customer contracts and the expansion of our existing products and services  including our communications services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new customer contracts or generate significant additional revenues from those contracts or any new products or services that we introduce 
even if we become profitable  we may not sustain or increase our profits on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
since sales of satellite communications equipment are dependent on the growth of communications networks  as market demand for these networks declines  our revenue and profitability are likely to decline 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a significant amount of revenue from the sale of satellite ground segment systems and networks 
if the long term growth in demand for communications networks does not occur as we expect  the demand for our satellite ground segment systems and networks may decline or grow more slowly than we expect 
as a result  we may not be able to grow our business  our revenue may decline from current levels and our results of operations may be harmed 
the demand for communications networks and the products used in these networks is affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  general economic conditions have deteriorated and affected the overall rate of capital spending by our customers 
also  many companies are finding it increasingly difficult to raise capital to finish building their communications networks and  therefore  are placing fewer orders with our customers 
the current economic slowdown has resulted in a softening of demand from our customers 
we believe that this slowdown is generally the result of slower than forecasted growth in a number of key segments  including communications infrastructure equipment  resulting from a reduction in the capital spending of service providers 
we cannot predict the extent to which this softening of demand will continue 
further  increased competition among satellite ground segment systems and networks manufacturers has increased pricing pressures 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
we market and sell our products and services in the united states and internationally 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future with a significant portion of the international revenue coming from developing countries 
we presently conduct our international sales in the following geographic areas africa  the asia pacific region  australia  central and south america  eastern and central europe and the middle east 
there are some risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including o general political and economic instability in international markets  as well as a result of the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and the related outbreak of hostilities  could impede our ability to deliver our products and services to customers and harm our results of operations  o changes in regulatory requirements could restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers  o export restrictions  tariffs  licenses and other trade barriers could prevent us from adequately equipping our network facilities  o differing technology standards across countries may impede our ability to integrate our products and services across international borders  o protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition may give unequal bargaining leverage to key vendors in countries where competition is scarce  significantly increasing our operating costs  o increased expenses associated with marketing services in foreign countries could effect our ability to compete  o relying on local subcontractors for installation of our products and services could adversely impact the quality of our products and services  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations could effect our ability to compete  o potentially adverse taxes could adversely affect our results of operations  o complex foreign laws and treaties could affect our ability to compete  and o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations 
these and other risks could impede our ability to manage our international operations effectively  limit the future growth of our business  increase our costs and require significant management attention 
if we are not successful in selling our communications services to our customers for whom we have historically provided satellite ground segment systems and networks  our results of operations will be harmed 
we have historically provided our customers with satellite ground segment systems and networks on a project by project basis 
we intend on marketing to our customers our communications services 
these services not only provide the implementation of the satellite ground segment systems and networks but also provide for the ongoing operation and maintenance of these systems and networks 
if we are not successful in selling these communications services to our existing customers  it will harm our results of operations 
if netsat does not execute its business strategy or if the market for its services fails to develop or develops more slowly than it expects  our results of operations will be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected 
netsat s revenues from data communications services has decreased and the costs of data communications services has increased in the fiscal year ended june  its future revenues and results of operations are dependent on its execution of its business strategy and development of the market for its current and future services 
in particular  the current level and manner of utilization of netsat s transponder space  as well as a decrease in orders currently being experienced  continues to harm our results of operation 
we cannot assure you that the transponder space will be efficiently and substantially utilized or that an increase in orders will be realized 
netsat has had  and we expect will continue to have  significant cash requirements  which have and will decrease our cash resources 
if netsat does not efficiently and substantially utilize its transponder space capacity or increase its level of orders  its cash requirements may increase and our results of operations will be harmed 
currency devaluations in the foreign markets in which we operate could decrease demand for our products and services 
we denominate our foreign sales in us dollars 
consequently  decreases in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect the demand for our products and services by increasing the price of our products and services in the currencies of the countries in which they are sold 
the difficult economic conditions in international markets and the resulting foreign currency devaluations have led to a decrease in demand for our products and services  and the decrease in bookings received by us from these foreign regions has adversely affected our results of operations for the fiscal years ended june  and we expect that these negative trends will continue to adversely impact our results of operations 
you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as an indication of our future results because they are subject to significant fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  our stock price could decline significantly 
our future revenues and results of operations may significantly fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including o delays and or a decrease in the booking of new contracts  o general political and economic conditions in the united states and abroad as a result of the terrorist attacks on september  and the related outbreak of hostilities  o the length of time needed to initiate and complete customer contracts  o the demand for and acceptance of our existing products and services  o the cost of providing our products and services  o the introduction of new and improved products and services by us or our competitors  o market acceptance of new products and services  o the mix of revenue between our standard products  custom built products and our communications services  o the timing of significant marketing programs  o our ability to hire and retain additional personnel  o the competition in our markets  and o difficult global economic conditions and the currency devaluations in international markets which have  and may continue to  adversely impact our quarterly results 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our markets are highly competitive and we have many established competitors  and we may lose market share as a result 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and this competition could harm our ability to sell our products and services on prices and terms favorable to us 
our primary competitors in the satellite ground segment and networks market include vertically integrated satellite systems providers like nippon electric corporation  systems integrators like idb systems  a division of mci worldcom inc and equipment manufacturers who also provide integrated systems like andrew corporation and vertex rsi 
in the communications services and internet access services markets  we compete with other satellite communication companies who provide similar services  like loral cyberstar  inc and panamsat corporation and verestar  as well as other isps 
in addition  we may compete with other communications service providers  mci worldcom inc  and satellite owners like new skies satellites nv and intelsat 
we anticipate that our competitors may develop or acquire services that provide functionality that is similar to that provided by our services and that those services may be offered at significantly lower prices or bundled with other services 
these competitors may have the financial resources to withstand substantial price competition and may be in a better position to endure difficult economic conditions in international markets  and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
moreover  many of our competitors have more extensive customer bases  broader customer relationships and broader industry alliances than we do that they could use to their advantage in competitive situations 
the markets in which we operate have limited barriers to entry and we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
moreover  our current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
existing and new competitors with their potential strategic relationships may rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial condition 
if the satellite communications industry fails to continue to develop or new technology makes it obsolete our business and financial condition will be harmed 
our business is dependent on the continued success and development of satellite communications technology  which competes with terrestrial communications transport technologies like terrestrial microwave  coaxial cable and fiber optic communications systems 
during the fiscal year ended june   fiber optic communications systems penetrated areas in which we have traditionally provided services 
if the satellite communications industry fails to continue to develop  or any technological development significantly improves the cost or efficiency of competing terrestrial systems relative to satellite systems  then our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
we may be unable to raise additional funds to meet our capital requirements in the future 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations in each year since our inception 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through june  however  our future liquidity and capital requirements are difficult to predict  as they depend on numerous factors  including the success of our existing product and service offerings  as well as competing technological and market developments 
in particular  netsat has had significant cost requirements  which are expected to continue in the future 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to meet additional working capital requirements and to support additional capital expenditures 
should this need arise  additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if additional funds are available  we may not find the terms favorable or commercially reasonable 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our operating activities  including marketing programs  hiring of additional personnel and research and development programs 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders will own a smaller percentage of our capital stock and new investors may pay less on average for their securities than  and could have rights superior to  existing stockholders 
we rely on our relationships with resellers in developing countries with emerging markets for sales of our products and services and the loss or failure of any of these relationships may harm our ability to market and sell our products and services 
we intend to provide our products and services and netsat s services almost entirely in developing countries where we have little or no market experience 
we intend to rely on resellers in those markets to provide their expertise and knowledge of the local regulatory environment in order to make access to customers in emerging markets easier 
if we are unable to maintain these relationships  or develop new ones in other emerging markets  our ability to enter into and compete successfully in developing countries would be adversely affected 
a limited number of customer contracts account for a high percentage of our revenues  and the inability to replace a key customer contract would adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
we rely on a small number of customer contracts for a large portion of our revenues and expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customer contracts 
we anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from large contracts with a small number of customers 
as a result of this concentration of our customer base  an inability to replace one or more of these large customer contracts would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate significant revenues from five contracts and a modification or termination of all or any of these contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have agreements with five customers to provide equipment and services  which we expect to generate substantial revenues 
if any of these customers are unable to implement their business plans  the market for their services declines  or all or any of the customers modifies or terminates its agreement with us  our results of operations and financial condition would be harmed 
we are paid a fixed price in most of our customer contracts  and any variation between the fixed price and the actual cost of performance may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
a majority of our customer contracts are on a fixed price basis 
the profitability of these contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties in the cost of performance  including costs related to unforeseen obstacles and unexpected problems encountered in engineering  design and testing of our products and services 
because a significant portion of our revenues is dependent upon a small number of customers  if the fixed price is significantly less than the actual cost of performance on any one contract  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if our products and services are not accepted in developing countries with emerging markets  our revenues will be impaired 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of the growth in the demand for our products and services will come from customers in developing countries due to a lack of basic communications infrastructure in these countries 
however  we cannot guarantee an increase in the demand for our products and services in developing countries or that customers in these countries will accept our products and services at all 
our ability to penetrate emerging markets in developing countries is dependent upon various factors including o the speed at which communications infrastructure  including terrestrial microwave  coaxial cable and fiber optic communications systems  which compete with satellite based services  is built  o the effectiveness of our local value added resellers and sales representatives in marketing and selling our products and services  and o the acceptance of our products and services by customers 
if our products and services are not accepted  or the market potential we anticipate does not develop  our revenues will be impaired 
we depend upon certain key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  managerial and marketing personnel  in particular  david hershberg  kenneth miller  patrick flemming  stephen yablonski and donald woodring 
the employment of any of our key personnel could cease at any time subject to prior notice 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our business 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as beneficial to our success 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our business 
we rely on trademark  trade secret and patent protection and contracts including confidentiality and license agreements with our employees  customers  strategic collaborators  consultants and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization 
we currently have been granted two patents in the united states  one for remote access to the internet using satellites  and the other for satellite communication with automatic frequency control  and have two patent applications pending in the united states 
we also intend to seek further patents on our technology  if appropriate 
we cannot assure you that patents will be issued for any of our pending or future patents or that any claims allowed from such applications will be of sufficient scope  or be issued in all countries where our products and services can be sold  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products and services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products and services more likely 
we have filed applications for trademark registration of globecomm systems inc  globecomm  and gsi in the united states and various other countries  and have been granted registrations for some of these terms in europe and russia 
we have received trademark registrations for netsat in the united states  the european community  russia  and brazil 
we have various other trademarks registered or pending for registration in the united states and in other countries and may intend to seek registration of other trademarks and service marks in the future 
we cannot assure you that registrations will be granted from any of our pending or future applications  or that any registrations that are granted will prevent others from using similar trademarks in connection with related goods and services 
defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be time consuming and expensive  and if we are not successful  could cause substantial expenses and disrupt our business 
we cannot be sure that our products  services  technologies  and advertising we employ in our business do not or will not infringe valid patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business 
prosecuting infringers and defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be time consuming and expensive  and regardless of whether we are or are not successful  could cause substantial expenses and disrupt our business 
we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party claims  regardless of their merit 
successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability and or may materially disrupt the conduct of  or necessitate the cessation of  our business 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological changes  which would make our products and services become non competitive and obsolete 
the telecommunications industry  including satellite based communications services  is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our products and services would become non competitive and obsolete  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are our sole or a limited source of supply  and the loss of these suppliers would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we currently obtain most of our critical components and services from single or limited sources and generally do not maintain significant inventories or have long term or exclusive supply contracts with our source vendors 
we have from time to time experienced delays in receiving products from vendors due to lack of availability  quality control or manufacturing problems  shortages of materials or components or product design difficulties 
we may experience delays in the future and replacement services or products may not be available when needed  or at all  or at commercially reasonable rates or prices 
if we were to change some of our vendors  we would have to perform additional testing procedures on the service or product supplied by the new vendors  which would prevent or delay the availability of our products and services 
furthermore  our costs could increase significantly if we need to change vendors 
if we do not get timely deliveries of quality products and services  or if there are significant increases in the prices of these products or services  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on netsat  our wholly owned subsidiary  for our main supply of space segment on satellites 
if its business fails or we are otherwise unable to continue to rely on netsat for this supply  our business may be harmed 
we currently depend on netsat for a majority of our transponder space on satellites 
we do not have a long term agreement in place with netsat  as most of our needs are filled on a purchase order basis 
if netsat is unable to develop its business or if we are unable to continue to rely on their supply for space segment  then we will have to find alternative suppliers 
if we are unable to find another supplier of transponder space or if we are unable to find one on terms favorable to us  then our business may be harmed 
our network may experience security breaches  which could disrupt our services 
our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks and similar disruptive problems caused by our customers or other internet users 
computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessation in service to our customers 
there currently is no existing technology that provides absolute security  and the cost of minimizing these security breaches could be prohibitively expensive 
we may face liability to customers for such security breaches 
furthermore  these incidents could deter potential customers and adversely affect existing customer relationships 
satellites upon which we rely may be damaged or lost  or malfunction 
the damage  loss or malfunction of any of the satellites used by us  or a temporary or permanent malfunction of any of the satellites upon which we rely  would likely result in the interruption of our satellite based communications services 
this interruption would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our stock price is highly volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering  which was completed in august the market price for our common stock  like that of the securities of many telecommunications and high technology industry companies  is likely to remain volatile based on many factors  including the following o quarterly variations in operating results  o announcements of new technology  products or services by us or any of our competitors  o acceptance of satellite based communication services and internet access services in developing countries with emerging markets  o changes in financial estimates or recommendations by security analysts  or o general market conditions  including  but not limited to  results of the terrorist attacks on september  in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type is often extremely expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could significantly harm our business 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring your shares of stock at a premium to the market price because of our anti takeover provisions 
various provisions with respect to votes in the election of directors  special meetings of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and section of the general corporation laws of the state of delaware could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to you and our other stockholders 
in addition  we have a poison pill in place that could make an acquisition of us by a third party more difficult 
risks related to government approvals we are subject to many government regulations  and failure to comply with them will harm our business 
operations and use of satellites we are subject to various federal laws and regulations  which may have negative effects on our business 
we operate fcc licensed earth stations in hauppauge  new york  subject to the fcc act and the rules and regulations of fcc 
pursuant to the act and rules  we have obtained and are required to maintain radio transmission licenses from the fcc for both domestic and foreign operations of our earth stations 
these licenses should be renewed by the fcc in the normal course as long as we remain in compliance with fcc rules and regulations 
however  we cannot guarantee that the fcc will grant additional licenses when our existing licenses expire  nor are we assured that the fcc will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses 
we are also required to comply with fcc regulations regarding the exposure of humans to radio frequency radiation from our earth stations 
these regulations  as well as local land use regulations  restrict our freedom to choose where to locate our earth stations 
foreign ownership we may  in the future  be required to seek fcc approval for foreign ownership if we operate as a common carrier and ownership of our stock exceeds the specified criteria 
failure to comply with these policies may result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership  fines  denial of license renewal  and or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the fcc 
foreign regulations regulatory schemes in countries in which we may seek to provide our satellite delivered data communications services may impose impediments on our operations 
some countries in which we intend to operate have telecommunications laws and regulations that do not currently contemplate technical advances in telecommunications technology like internet intranet transmission by satellite 
we cannot assure you that the present regulatory environment in any of those countries will not be changed in a manner  which may have a material adverse impact on our business 
either we or our local partners typically must obtain authorization for each country in which we provide our satellite delivered data communications services 
the regulatory schemes in each country are different  and thus there may be instances of noncompliance of which we are not aware 
we cannot assure you that our licenses and approvals are or will remain sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that necessary licenses and approvals will be granted on a timely basis in all jurisdictions in which we wish to offer our products and services or that restrictions applicable thereto will not be unduly burdensome 
regulation of the internet due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted at the local  national or international levels with respect to the internet  covering issues including user privacy and expression  pricing of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security or the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of our internet operations will be carried out in countries  which may impose greater regulation of the content of information coming into the country than that which is generally applicable in the united states  for example  privacy regulations in countries in europe and content restrictions in countries including the republic of china 
to the extent that we provide content as a part of our internet services  it will be subject to laws regulating content 
moreover  the adoption of laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our internet services or increase our cost of doing business or in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues including property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for our products and services  could increase our cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased product development costs  or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
telecommunications taxation  support requirements  and access charges all telecommunications carriers providing domestic services in the united states are required to contribute a portion of their gross revenues for the support of universal telecommunications services  and some telecommunications services are subject to special taxation and to contribution requirements to support services to special groups  like persons with disabilities 
our services may be subject to new or increased taxes and contribution requirements that could affect our profitability  particularly if we are not able to pass them through to customers for either competitive or regulatory reasons 
internet services are currently exempt from charges that long distance telephone companies pay for access to the networks of local telephone companies in the united states 
efforts have been made from time to time  and may be made again in the future  to eliminate this exemption 
if these access charges are imposed on telephone lines used to reach internet service providers  and or if flat rate telephone services for internet access are eliminated or curtailed  the cost to customers who access our satellite facilities using telephone company provided facilities could increase to an extent that could discourage the demand for our services 
likewise  the demand for our services in other countries may be affected by the availability and cost of local telephone or other telecommunications facilities to reach our facilities 
export of telecommunications equipment the sale of our ground segment systems  networks  and communications services outside the united states is subject to compliance with the regulations of the united states export administration regulations 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  in order to ship our products into other countries  the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country 
if we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products  our sales in those countries could be restricted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors 
in the normal course of business  we assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
our objective to managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates for certain purchases from foreign vendors  if applicable 
accordingly  we utilize from time to time foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we had no such foreign currency forward contracts 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in money market funds with portfolios of investment grade corporate and government securities  and secondly  our fixed long term capital lease agreement 
under our current positions  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
