item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december   usx corporation disposed of its steel business through a tax free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation united states steel to holders of usx us steel group common stock steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one for one basis the separation and changed its name to marathon oil corporation marathon 
marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas  domestic refining  marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its percent owned subsidiary marathon ashland petroleum llc map  and other energy related businesses 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
marathon s financial performance benefited from strong worldwide natural gas prices and domestic refining margins 
however  later in the year  performance was negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas prices  as well as lower downstream margins  primarily from decreased demand caused by the general downturn in the global economy and warmer than normal weather 
certain sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include forward looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of marathon 
these statements typically contain words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  targets or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain 
in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors  though not necessarily all such factors  that could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
for additional risk factors affecting the businesses of marathon  see disclosures regarding forward looking statements on page management s discussion and analysis of critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements for marathon requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the primary financial statements and the related footnote disclosures 
marathon considers the following accounting policies to be most significantly impacted by the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
deferred taxes oil and gas exploration and production is a global business 
as a result  marathon is subject to taxation on its income in numerous jurisdictions 
state and local income taxes are deductible and foreign income taxes in certain circumstances are creditable against u 
s 
federal income taxes 
these interrelationships complicate the assessment of the realizability of deferred income tax assets 
marathon considers future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil prices 
the judgments and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used for other financial statement purposes  including the determination of possible impairment of long lived assets held and used 
additionally  generally accepted accounting principles require that marathon consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the principal tax planning strategy available to marathon relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of the complexities inherent in multiple tax jurisdictions and the focus of generally accepted accounting principles on the proper measurement of deferred taxes recorded on the balance sheet  deferred tax adjustments included in the provision for income taxes do not necessarily correspond with amounts reported in income before income taxes 
property  plant and equipment marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affects  among other things  whether or not costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and whether or not the costs capitalized in the balance sheet should be impaired 
marathon s estimation of total proved reserves is a highly technical process performed primarily by in house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals 
the actual recoverability of hydrocarbons can vary from estimated amounts 
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data  estimates of proved reserves are subject to potentially substantial changes  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and contractual and economic conditions change 
marathon adheres to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs relating to unproved property investments 
generally  the greatest portion of these costs relate to the acquisition of leasehold interests 
the costs incurred are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by general economic factors and potential shifts in the business strategy employed by management 
marathon considers a combination of time and geologic factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these capitalized costs 
contingent liabilities marathon accrues liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies in accordance with sfas no 
such contingent obligations are assessed regularly by marathon s in house tax legal counsel and advisers 
in certain circumstances  outside legal counsel is utilized 
each potential issue is assessed individually  although accrued liabilities are aggregated and recorded by jurisdiction and by type of tax 
although it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of examinations of open tax years  management believes that the recorded amounts are reasonable 
marathon accrues its environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position liabilities for litigation claims and settlements are accrued in accordance with sfas no 
such contingent obligations are assessed regularly by marathon s in house legal counsel 
in certain circumstances  outside legal counsel is utilized 
both environmental remediation liabilities and liabilities for litigation claims and settlements are recognized based on the likelihood of a third party having a viable claim against marathon s assets 
each potential liability is assessed individually 
for additional information on environmental liabilities  see note to the financial statements 
employee related benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions relating to expected rates of return on plan assets  determination of discount rates for remeasuring plan obligations  determination of inflation rates regarding compensation levels and health care cost projections 
marathon develops its demographics and utilizes the work of actuaries to assist with the measurement of employee related obligations 
the assumptions used vary from year to year  which will affect future results of operations 
any differences among these assumptions and marathon s actual return on assets  financial market based discount rates  and the level of cost sharing provisions will also impact future results of operations

rm t segment income increased by million in from following an increase of million in from the increase in was primarily due to a higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin partially offset by lower ssa gasoline and distillate sales volumes and increased refining and wholesale marketing transportation expense 
the increase in was primarily due to higher refined product margins  partially offset by higher operating expenses for ssa  higher administrative expenses including increased variable pay plan costs  and higher transportation costs 
other energy related businesses segment income increased by million in following a decrease of million in from the increase in was primarily a result of higher crude oil purchase and resale activity accompanied by increased margins and losses from derivative activities recorded in the decrease in was primarily due to losses from derivative activities and the reversal of pipeline abandonment accruals recorded in items not allocated to reportable segments imv reserve adjustment when marathon was acquired in march  crude oil and refined product prices were at historically high levels 
in applying the purchase method of accounting  crude oil and refined product inventories were revalued by reference to current prices at the time of acquisition  and this became the new lifo cost basis of the inventories 
generally accepted accounting principles require that inventories be carried at lower of cost or market 
accordingly  marathon established an imv reserve to reduce the cost basis of its inventories to net realizable value 
quarterly adjustments to the imv reserve result in noncash charges or credits to income from operations 
when marathon acquired the crude oil and refined product inventories associated with ashland s rm t operations on january   marathon established a new lifo cost basis for those inventories 
the acquisition cost of these inventories lowered the overall average cost of the combined rm t inventories 
as a result  the price threshold at which an imv reserve will be recorded was also lowered 
in  the imv reserve adjustment resulted in a charge to income from operations of million 
no adjustment was required in the unfavorable imv reserve adjustment was primarily due to the significant decrease in refined product prices  which occurred during the fourth quarter of net interest and other financial costs decreased by million in from  following a decrease of million in from the decrease in was primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased capitalized interest on rm t projects 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased interest income 
for additional details  see note to the financial statements 
the minority interest in income of map  which represents ashland s percent ownership interest  increased by million in from  following an increase of million in from the increase in and was primarily due to higher map income 
the provision for income taxes was million in  compared with in and in the higher provision is primarily a result of increased income from operations 
the provision included a one time  noncash deferred tax charge of million as a result of the change in the amount  timing and nature of expected future foreign source income due to the exchange of marathon s interest in sakhalin energy for other oil and gas producing interests

net income decreased by million in from  following a decrease of million in from  primarily reflecting the factors discussed above 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity current assets decreased million from year end  primarily due to a decrease in receivables and assets held for sale  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in receivables was mainly due to lower year end commodity prices and the decrease in assets held for sale was primarily the result of the contribution of the yates field assets to the mkm partners lp joint venture 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulted from cash balances which were attributed in part to united states steel in prior years 
current liabilities decreased million from year end  primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable  including accounts payable to united states steel  partially offset by an increase in redeemable securities 
the decrease in accounts payable was due to lower year end commodity prices 
the decrease in accounts payable to united states steel resulted from the settlement of income taxes with united states steel upon separation 
under marathon s previous tax allocation policy  income tax settlements with united states steel generally occurred in march of the following year 
obligations to repay preferred securities reflect securities that became redeemable or that were converted to a right to receive cash upon separation 
these obligations were paid in january investments and long term receivables increased million from year end  primarily due to the contribution of assets to mkm partners lp and pilot travel centers llc joint ventures 
net investment in united states steel was eliminated with the disposition of the steel business 
long term receivables from united states steel of million represents long term debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment 
net property  plant and equipment increased million from year end  primarily due to the acquisition of pennaco energy  inc pennaco  completion of the coker unit at the garyville refinery and implementation of an integrated software system  partially offset by the sale of certain canadian assets and the contribution of travel centers to pilot travel centers llc

derivative instruments see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page  for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk 
liquidity and capital resources marathon s main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  committed and uncommitted credit facilities  and access to both the debt and equity capital markets 
marathon s ability to access the debt capital market is supported by its investment grade credit ratings 
because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to marathon  including internally generated cash flow  marathon s management believes that its short term and long term liquidity is adequate to fund operations  including its capital spending program  repayment of debt maturities for the years   and  and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies which are discussed in note to the financial statements 
marathon has a committed  million long term revolving credit facility and a committed million day revolving credit facility 
at december   million had been drawn against these facilities 
additionally  at december   marathon had an aggregate of million in three other short term credit facilities  of which no amounts were drawn 
map currently has a committed million long term revolving credit facility and a committed million day revolving credit facility 
as of december   map did not have any borrowings against these facilities or under its million revolving credit agreement with ashland inc certain securities became redeemable or were converted to a right to receive cash upon the separation of united states steel 
in early january  marathon paid million to retire the convertible quarterly income preferred securities and million to retire the cumulative convertible preferred stock 
in early march  marathon issued notes of million due and million due  bearing interest at percent and percent  respectively 
marathon used the net proceeds to repay amounts borrowed to fund the purchase price and associated costs of the january acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties and related assets in equatorial guinea  west africa 
marathon initially funded this acquisition through a combination of borrowings under long term and short term revolving credit facilities  borrowings under other short term credit facilities and cash on hand 
marathon is not dependent on off balance sheet arrangements to meet its liquidity and capital resource needs 
marathon has used and may use in the future off balance sheet arrangements to fund specific projects 
the largest category of off balance sheet arrangements is operating lease obligations  for which contractual cash obligations totaled million at december  of that total  million related to three agreements which covered two lng tankers and marathon s headquarters building  respectively 
under those three arrangements  marathon does not have an ownership interest in the entities that hold the leased assets nor does marathon hold title to the respective leased assets 
these entities were established by financial institutions for the purpose of leasing specific assets to marathon 
such entities are limited in the type of business activity that can be transacted 
the table below provides aggregated information on marathon s obligations and commitments to make future payments under existing contracts as of december  summary of contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments dollars in millions total later years contractual cash obligations excluding amounts assumed by united states steel short and long term debt   capital lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements operating lease obligations operating lease obligations under sublease unconditional purchase obligations commercial commitments excluding amounts related to united states steel throughput and deficiency agreements guarantees of the indebtedness of others contract commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment total excluding amounts related to united states steel    contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel long term debt sale leaseback financing off balance sheet arrangements operating lease obligations operating lease obligations under sublease commercial commitments related to united states steel guarantees of indebtedness of others total amounts related to united states steel total contractual obligations and commercial commitments    marathon remains primarily obligated for certain debt and other financings for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation 
in addition  marathon remains contingently liable for certain operating lease obligations of united states steel 
marathon has also guaranteed certain obligations related to the business of united states steel 
united states steel is the sole general partner of clairton b partnership  lp  which owns certain coke making facilities formerly owned by united states steel 
marathon has guaranteed to the limited partners all obligations of united states steel under the partnership documents 
united states steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances  including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of million 
in addition to the normal commitments of a general partner  united states steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures 
as of december   united states steel had no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners and  accordingly  no amounts were reflected in the above table for this guarantee 
excluded from the table is indebtedness of equity investees which marathon does not support through guarantees or otherwise 
if marathon were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata basis  its share would have been approximately million as of december  in the event of default by any of these equity investees  marathon has no obligation to support the debt  however  any such default could adversely impact our financial investment in the respective equity investee 
the table excludes commitments to transport crude oil  natural gas and refined products that were not negotiated as part of arranging the financing of the transportation facilities under contract  which totaled million at december  the table also excludes contractual obligations under long term agreements to purchase crude oil  refinery feedstock and refined products used in day to day operations to generate revenues 
marathon management s opinion concerning liquidity and marathon s ability to avail itself in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward looking statements are based on currently available information 
to the extent that this information proves to be inaccurate  future availability of financing may be adversely affected 
factors that affect the availability of financing include the performance of marathon as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities  the state of worldwide debt and equity markets  investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance  the global financial climate  and  in particular  with respect to borrowings  the levels of marathon s outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies 
management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies marathon has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of marathon s products and services  operating results will be adversely affected 
marathon believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations 
however  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities  marketing areas  production processes and whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business  power business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 
marathon s environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were a dollars in millions capital compliance operating maintenance remediation b total a amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines and include percent of map 
b these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves  net of recoveries  where permissible  but do not include noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation 
marathon s environmental capital expenditures accounted for four percent of total capital expenditures in  five percent in  and three percent in during through  compliance expenditures represented one percent of marathon s total operating costs 
remediation spending during this period was primarily related to retail marketing outlets which incur ongoing clean up costs for soil and groundwater contamination associated with underground storage tanks and piping 
marathon has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp at waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla as of december  in addition  there are three sites where marathon has received information requests or other indications that marathon may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability 
there are also additional sites  excluding retail marketing outlets  related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
of these sites  were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland for which ashland has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation 
at many of these sites  marathon is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation  as well as marathon s share thereof  is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies 
marathon accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise  charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 
see note to the financial statements 
new or expanded environmental requirements  which could increase marathon s environmental costs  may arise in the future 
marathon intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment  but since many of them are not fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation  it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate cost of compliance  including remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed 
however  based on presently available information  and existing laws and regulations as currently implemented  marathon does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures including operating and maintenance and remediation will materially increase in marathon s environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in predictions beyond can only be broad based estimates  which have varied  and will continue to vary  due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements  the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies  among other matters 
based upon currently identified projects  marathon anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 
new tier ii gasoline rules  which were finalized by the epa in february  and the diesel fuel rules  which were finalized in january  require substantially reduced sulfur levels 
the combined capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately million between and this is a forward looking statement 
some factors among others that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits  operating and logistical considerations  further refinement of preliminary engineering studies and project scopes  and unforeseen hazards 
in may  marathon and map settled  in a consent decree  epa allegations that the robinson refinery did not qualify for an exemption under the national emission standards for benzene waste operations pursuant to the clean air act caa 
the government had alleged in a federal court lawsuit that the refinery s total annual benzene releases exceeded the limitation of megagrams per year  and as a result  the refinery was in violation of the benzene waste emission control  record keeping  and reporting requirements 
the consent decree was approved by the court on july  and requires marathon and map to pay a combined million civil penalty  perform  in supplemental environmental projects  as part of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations  and install various controls and other improvements 
in  the epa conducted multi media inspections of map s detroit and robinson refineries  covering compliance with the caa  the clean water act  reporting obligations under the emergency planning and community right to know act  cercla and the handling of process waste 
the epa served a number of notices of violation nov and findings of violation as a result of these inspections  but these allegations were resolved as part of the new source review consent decree which map agreed to on may  map s settlement with the epa includes all of map s refineries and commits map to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to map s refineries over approximately an eight year period 
the current estimated cost to complete these programs is approximately million in expenditures over the next seven years 
map is also committed to the performance of about million in supplemental environmental projects and has paid an aggregate civil penalty in of million  as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations 
map believes that this settlement will provide map with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions 
the court approved this consent decree on august  in  the kentucky natural resources and environmental cabinet sent marathon ashland pipe line llc a nov seeking a civil penalty associated with a pipeline spill earlier that year in winchester  kentucky 
map has settled this nov in the form of an agreed to administrative order which was finalized and entered in january and required payment of a  penalty and reimbursement of past response costs up to  marathon is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of certain of these matters 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to marathon 
however  management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to marathon 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity on page outlook the outlook regarding marathon s upstream revenues and income is largely dependent upon future prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been affected by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in worldwide economic activity and political developments in the world s major oil and gas producing and consuming areas 
any significant decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on marathon s results of operations 
a prolonged decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and natural gas reserves that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development 
in  worldwide production is expected to average  barrels of oil equivalent per day  split evenly between liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  including marathon s proportionate share of equity investee s production and future acquisitions 
on january   marathon completed its acquisition of cms energy s interests in equatorial guinea 
for a total cash consideration of million  excluding working capital adjustments  marathon acquired 
a percent interest in  and operatorship of  the offshore alba block  which contains the currently producing alba gas field as well as undeveloped oil and gas discoveries and several possible exploration prospects  
a percent interest in the adjacent offshore block d  
a percent interest in an onshore condensate separation facility  
a percent interest in a joint venture onshore methanol production plant  
a percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant 
in  marathon plans to drill  or complete drilling operations on three or four deepwater wells in the gulf of mexico  including the appraisal of the ozona deep discovery 
other major upstream projects  which are currently underway or under evaluation and are expected to improve future income streams  include 
norway  where marathon has completed the acquisition of various interests in five licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea  
alaska  where marathon recently had a natural gas discovery on the ninilchik unit on the kenai peninsula 
additional drilling is planned in 
angola  where marathon expects to participate in the drilling of up to three exploration wells during on february   marathon announced proposed plans for a major liquefied natural gas lng re gasification and power generation complex near tijuana in the mexican state of baja california 
the proposed complex would consist of a lng marine terminal  an off loading terminal  onshore lng re gasification facilities  and pipeline infrastructure necessary to transport the natural gas 
in addition  a megawatt natural gas fired power generation plant would be constructed on the site 
the complex would supply natural gas and electricity for local use as well as for export to southern california 
completion and potential start up is projected for on february   marathon announced plans to lead an initiative for a new north sea natural gas pipeline designed to provide additional gas for the uk market 
the proposed kilometer dry natural gas pipeline would connect the norwegian heimdal area of the north sea to bacton  on the southeast coast of the uk the pipeline would pass through the brae complex and pass adjacent to other large gas processing transportation facilities in the uk north sea 
the pipeline would terminate at or near the existing bacton terminal 
the pipeline would allow gas to be aggregated from numerous uk and norwegian north sea producers for transportation to bacton where it would then be sold to commercial  industrial and residential customers 
marathon estimates that the pipeline could begin operations in the above discussion includes forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of marathon s worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production  and the exploration drilling program 
some factors that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and the exploration drilling program include acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto  pricing  supply and demand for petroleum products  amount of capital available for exploration and development  occurrence of acquisitions dispositions of oil and gas properties  regulatory constraints  timing of commencing production from new wells  drilling rig availability and other geological  operating and economic considerations 
these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
some factors that could affect the planned construction of the lng re gasification  power generation and related facilities  as well as the north sea pipeline transportation and related facilities  include  but are not limited to  unforeseen difficulty in the negotiation of definitive agreements among project participants  identification of additional participants to reach optimum levels of participation  inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals  arranging sufficient project financing  unanticipated changes in market demand or supply  competition with similar projects  and environmental and permitting issues 
additionally  the lng project could be impacted by the availability or construction of sufficient lng vessels 
marathon s downstream income is largely dependent upon the refining and wholesale marketing margin for refined products  the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates  and the gross margin on retail merchandise sales 
the refining and wholesale marketing margin reflects the difference between the wholesale selling prices of refined products and the cost of raw materials refined  purchased product costs and manufacturing expenses 
refining and wholesale marketing margins have been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas  the regulatory climate  the seasonal pattern of certain product sales  crude oil costs  manufacturing costs  the available supply of crude oil and refined products  and logistical constraints 
the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates reflects the difference between the retail selling prices of these products and their wholesale cost including secondary transportation 
retail gasoline and distillate margins have also been historically volatile  but tend to be counter cyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin 
factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include seasonal demand fluctuations  the available wholesale supply  the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations which impact driving conditions 
the gross margin on retail merchandise sales tends to be less volatile than the retail gasoline and distillate margin 
factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items and the level of economic activity in the marketing area 
at its catlettsburg  kentucky refinery  map has initiated a multi year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses 
this program involves the expansion  conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units which  in addition to improving profitability  will reduce the refinery s total gasoline pool sulfur below ppm  thereby eliminating the need for additional clean fuels program investments at the refinery 
the project is expected to be completed in map is working to improve its logistics network and marathon ashland pipe line llc has been designated operator of the centennial pipeline  owned jointly by panhandle eastern pipe line company  a subsidiary of cms energy corporation  map  and te products pipe line company  limited partnership 
the new pipeline  which will connect the gulf coast refiners with the midwest market  will have the capacity to transport approximately  barrels per day of refined petroleum products and is expected to be operational in the first quarter of a map subsidiary  ohio river pipe line llc orpl  plans to build a pipeline from kenova  west virginia to columbus  ohio 
orpl is a common carrier pipeline company and the pipeline will be an interstate common carrier pipeline 
the pipeline is currently known as cardinal products pipe line and is expected to initially move about  barrels per day of refined petroleum into the central ohio region 
as of december  orpl has secured all of the rights of way required to build the pipeline 
applications for the remaining construction permits have been filed 
construction is currently planned for summer pending receipt of permits  with start up of the pipeline to follow in first half the above discussion includes forward looking statements with respect to the catlettsburg refinery and the centennial pipeline and cardinal products pipe line systems 
some factors which could potentially cause the actual results from the catlettsburg investment program to differ materially from current expectations include the price of petroleum products  levels of cash flows from operations  obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and regulatory approval constraints 
the primary factor  which could impact the centennial pipeline system  is unforeseen hazards 
some factors  which could impact the cardinal products pipe line  include obtaining the necessary permits and completion of construction 
these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
accounting standards adopted in effective january   marathon adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and this statement  as amended  requires recognition of all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
for additional information  see note of the financial statements 
to be adopted in future periods in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas no 
 no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june   be accounted for under the purchase method  eliminating the use of the pooling method 
this statement also establishes for all business combinations made after june   specific criteria for the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
also requires that the excess of fair value of acquired assets over cost in a business combination negative goodwill be recognized immediately as an extraordinary gain  rather than deferred and amortized 
marathon will account for the acquisition of certain interests from cms energy in january under sfas no 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period for intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
marathon will adopt sfas no 
effective january   as required 
at that time  the annual amortization of existing goodwill of million  net of tax  will cease on the unamortized portion associated with previous acquisitions and certain investments accounted for under the equity method 
a transitional impairment test is required for existing goodwill as of the date of adoption of this standard  which must be completed within the first year 
any impairment loss resulting from applying the transitional goodwill impairment test will be reported as a change in accounting principle 
goodwill recorded after adoption of this standard is to be tested for impairment at least annually and any resulting impairment is not considered part of the change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
establishes a new accounting model for the recognition and measurement of retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that an asset retirement cost be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
marathon will adopt this statement effective january   as required 
the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
at this time  marathon cannot reasonably estimate the effect of the adoption of this statement on either its financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

this statement establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
marathon will adopt the statement prospectively effective january  the timing of classifying a long lived asset as held for sale may change as compared to previous accounting standards

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments marathon uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its price risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of crude oil  natural gas  and refined products 
for transactions that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are classified within other comprehensive income  if the hedge qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
the resulting deferred gains or losses are subsequently recognized in income from operations  in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
if the hedge position qualifies as a fair value hedge  the resulting gains or losses from the change in fair value of both the hedged item and the related derivative  are reflected within income in that period 
marathon also uses derivative instruments to economically hedge price risk but designates such strategies as nonhedge 
changes in fair value for these contracts is reflected within income in that period 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities are marked to market and the resulting gains or losses are recognized in the current period in income from operations 
while marathon s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose marathon to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect marathon s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods 
however  management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the financial statements 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of its business  marathon is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of crude oil  natural gas and refined products 
to a lesser extent  marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials 
marathon s market risk strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and services and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
however  marathon uses fixed price contracts and derivative commodity instruments to manage a minor portion of its commodity price risk 
marathon uses fixed price contracts for portions of its natural gas production to manage exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
certain derivative commodity instruments have the effect of restoring the equity portion of fixed price sales of natural gas to variable market based pricing 
these instruments are used as part of marathon s overall risk management programs 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pretax income of hypothetical percent and percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december  and december   are provided in the following table a dollars in millions incremental decrease in pretax income assuming a hypothetical price change of a derivative commodity instruments b c crude oil d e e e e natural gas d e e e e refined products d f f e e a marathon remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of derivative instruments  however  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item 
effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analyses 
amounts reflect the estimated incremental effect on pretax income  after deducting for minority interest 
amounts reflect hypothetical and changes in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december  and december  marathon management evaluates their portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions and changes in risk profiles 
marathon is also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review  including the use of master netting agreements to the extent practical 
changes to the portfolio subsequent to december   would cause future pretax income effects to differ from those presented in the table 
b the number of net open contracts varied throughout  from a low of  contracts at july  to a high of  contracts at november  and averaged  for the year 
the derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken also varied throughout  and will continue to vary in the future 
because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time  the number of open contracts  by itself  cannot be used to predict future income effects 
c the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated 
gains and losses on options are based on changes in intrinsic value only 
d the direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity reflects that which would result in the largest incremental decrease in pretax income when applied to the derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity 
e price increase 
f price decrease 
marathon uses derivative instruments in its exploration and production e p operations to mitigate the price risk associated with equity production of crude oil and natural gas volumes 
in addition  marathon has sold forward a specified volume of natural gas 
marathon has used derivatives to convert the fixed price in this contract to market prices 
the underlying physical contract matures in marathon recorded total net pretax derivative gains losses of approximately million in and million in the amounts for were diminimus 
marathon s refining  marketing  and transportation rm t operations generally use derivative commodity instruments to lock in costs of certain crude oil and other feedstocks  to protect carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products 
marathon s rm t operations recorded total net pretax derivative gains losses  net of the percent minority interest in map  of approximately million in  million in  and million for marathon s trading activity gains losses are included in the afore mentioned amounts and totaled million in  million in and million in  respectively 
marathon s other energy related businesses are exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas 
marathon uses derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes 
marathon recorded net pretax derivative gains losses of million in  million in and million in  respectively 
marathon is subject to basis risk  caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity 
natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets 
for example  new york mercantile exchange nymex contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana s henry hub  while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices 
to the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions  derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge  resulting in increased exposure to basis risk 
these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results 
otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued marathon is subject to liquidity risk  caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position 
due to the large number of active participants  liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange traded transactions 
interest rate risk marathon is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations affecting the fair value of certain non derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent decrease in year end and interest rates is provided in the following table dollars in millions as of december  incremental incremental increase in increase in non derivative financial fair fair fair fair instruments a value b value c value b value c financial assets investments and long term receivables d financial liabilities long term debt e f   preferred stock of subsidiary g 
total liabilities   a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see note to the financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c for financial liabilities  this assumes a decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of marathon s long term debt at december  and december  d for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
e includes amounts due within one year 
f fair value was based on market prices where available  or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements 
g see note to the financial statements for further explanation 
at december  and  marathon s portfolio of long term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
this sensitivity is illustrated by the million increase in the fair value of long term debt assuming a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates 
however  marathon s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect marathon s results and cash flows only to the extent that marathon would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk marathon is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to anticipated revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
marathon has used on occasion forward currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage this risk 
at december   marathon had no open forward currency contracts in place 
at december   marathon had open canadian dollar forward purchase contracts with a total carrying value of approximately million 
a percent increase in the december   canadian dollar to us dollar forward rate  would have resulted in a charge to income of approximately million 
safe harbor marathon s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas  refined products and other feedstocks 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to marathon s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
