item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segments us global investors  inc company or us global  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
the company generates substantially all its operating revenues from the investment management of products and services for the us global investors funds usgif and us global accolade funds usgaf 
notwithstanding the fact that the company generates the majority of its revenues from this segment  the company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments 
as of june   the company held approximately million in investments  comprising of its total assets 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 
investment management products and services as noted above  the company generates substantially all of its revenues from managing and servicing usgif and usgaf 
these revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations 
during fiscal year  total average assets under management decreased to billion primarily because of depreciation of the equity markets and shareholder withdrawals from the bonnel growth fund  one of the usgaf funds 
average assets under management dollars in millions change change usgif money market usgif other usgif total     usgaf total     investment activities management believes it can more effectively manage the company s cash position by broadening the types of investments used in cash management 
management attempts to maximize the company s cash position by using a diversified venture capital approach to investing 
strategically  management invests in early stage or start up businesses seeking initial financing and more mature businesses in need of capital for expansion  acquisitions  management buyouts  or recapitalization 
management has reduced these activities due to poor market conditions 
as of june  and  the company held approximately and million  respectively  in investments other than usgif money market mutual fund shares 
in fiscal year  the company received  in trading and available for sale securities in liquidation of its investment in the us global strategies fund limited guernsey fund  an offshore fund managed by the company 
investment income from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  and dividend and interest income 
this source of revenue does not remain at a consistent level and is dependent on market fluctuations  the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities  and timing of transactions 
for fiscal years   and  the company had net realized gains losses of approximately   and  respectively 
the company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future as fluctuations in the market value of the company s investments will affect the amounts of such gains or losses 
consolidated results of operations the following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the company and a more detailed discussion of the company s revenues and expenses 
change change net income loss in thousands net income loss per share basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding in thousands basic     diluted     year ended june   compared with year ended june  the company posted a net after tax loss of  loss per share for the year ended june   compared with a net after tax loss of  loss per share for the year ended june  the decease in net loss for was principally due to the company s reduction of the overall expense reimbursement levels of its funds 
the company has also undertaken a significant realignment of its cost structures in order to better cope with declining fund asset levels due to adverse market conditions 
however  offsetting these activities was a decline in both investment advisory and transfer agent revenues  as well as other ancillary operations 
year ended june   compared with year ended june  the company posted a net after tax loss of  loss per share for the year ended june   compared with net after tax income of  income per share for the year ended june  the decrease in net income for was principally due to declines in investment advisory and transfer agent revenues and investment income 
these decreases in revenues were partially offset by reductions in general and administrative expenses 
revenues dollars in thousands change change investment advisory fees usgif money market     usgif other     usgif total     usgaf     other n a total investment advisory fees     transfer agent fees     custodial and administrative fees mailing services fees investment income other revenues n a total     investment advisory fees 
investment advisory fees  the largest component of the company s revenues  are calculated as a percentage ranging from to of average net assets and are paid monthly 
the company has agreed to waive its fee revenues and or pay expenses for certain usgif funds for purposes of enhancing the funds competitive market positions  in particular the money market and fixed income funds 
the aggregate amount of fees waived and expenses born by the company totaled   and  in   and  respectively 
the company expects to continue to waive fees and or pay for fund expenses if market and economic conditions warrant 
however  subject to the company s commitment to certain funds with respect to fee waivers and expense limitations  the company may reduce the amount of fund expenses it is bearing 
net investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed 
the decrease in net advisory fees in fiscal year of approximately  or  over fiscal year was largely due to continued market declines and shareholder redemptions in the company s equity funds  particularly the bonnel growth fund and the all american equity fund 
this is a trend experienced by the entire industry as equity markets have not climbed back from their negative returns as of yet 
the company has also experienced net redemptions in its us government securities savings fund 
again  this is an industry trend as yields have fallen significantly and money market funds have lost ground to other higher yielding products 
the company was able to mitigate this loss and actually improve the margin on this fund with a reduced amount of expense reimbursements 
in contrast to its other equity funds  the company realized sizeable increases in its high margin gold funds 
this sector had outstanding returns in response to the downtrodden equity markets  deficit spending by the us government  year lows in interest rates  and a weaker us dollar 
the decrease in net advisory fees in fiscal year of approximately million  or  over fiscal year was largely due to market declines in the company s equity funds  particularly in the bonnel growth fund  world gold fund  and all american equity fund  and shareholder withdrawals from the bonnel growth fund 
transfer agent fees 
united shareholder services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  provides transfer agency  lockbox  and printing services for company clients 
the company receives  as compensation for services rendered as transfer agent  an annual fee per account and is reimbursed for out of pocket expenses associated with processing shareholder information 
transfer agent fees are therefore affected by the number of client accounts 
the fee decrease in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  is a result of a decrease in mutual fund shareholder accounts from  to  the company has continued to see a decline in its number of accounts serviced as many smaller accounts in the funds continue to close 
in order to lower fund expense ratios on its equity funds  the company instituted a small account fee for its equity and fixed income funds in january this fee serves to encourage active investment and account growth by shareholders of the funds and discourage the maintenance of inactive accounts with small balances 
as a result of this fee  the company expects to have a significant increase in the number of client accounts closed for calendar year the company expects this to be a singular event  which  though painful in the short term  will result in improved long term fund profitability and lower expense ratios for its equity funds  improving their competitive positioning against their respective peer groups 
the decrease in fees in fiscal year  as compared with fiscal year  is a result of a decrease in mutual fund shareholder accounts from  to  custodial and administrative fees 
security trust financial company stfc  a wholly owned state chartered trust company  provided custodial and or trustee services for iras and other retirement plans administered by the company 
the custodial fees were previously paid to stfc at calendar year end upon separate invoice to the customer  not the funds 
effective january   us global administrators  inc usga  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  began providing qualified plan administration and record keeping services for existing k clients  which services were previously offered by stfc 
the administrative fees were paid to usga on a quarterly basis by its clients 
usga ceased revenue generating operations on may  stfc continued to collect its custodial fees through may   at which time a majority of these fees transferred to usgi 
both companies were liquidated during fiscal year the decrease in custodial and administrative fees of approximately  or  for fiscal year from the previous year was a result of the discontinuation of usga s k servicing operations  a decline in the number of custodial accounts administered  and a revenue sharing agreement with the entity usgi contracted to provide custodial services for these accounts 
custodial and administrative fees decreased approximately  or  in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the phasing out of usga s k servicing operations 
management made the determination that these supplemental operations were not the company s core strength and required an excessive amount of capital to reach competitive levels 
mailing services 
a b mailers  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  provides mail handling services to various entities 
one of a b mailers primary customers is the company in connection with its efforts to promote the funds 
each service is priced separately 
the decrease in mailing service fees of approximately  or  for fiscal year was a result of an adjustment to revenues to properly reflect mailing volumes 
the decrease also resulted from overall decreased mailing volumes 
this is a result of several trends  including reduced numbers of smaller accounts which require mailings and continued efforts to have shareholders use electronic media such as the website and e mail as a means of communication 
mailing service fees decreased approximately  or  in fiscal year this decline was due primarily to reduced mailing activities for usgif and usgaf as well as outside clients 
expenses dollars in thousands change change employee compensation and     benefits general and administrative     marketing and distribution depreciation and amortization interest and finance total     employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year by  or  due to continued staff reductions 
these reductions were primarily made in the shareholder communications and marketing areas 
this was in response to a reduced number of accounts to service  a decline in the activity of existing accounts  and an effort to streamline marketing efforts to reduce overhead 
employee compensation and benefits decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year by approximately  or  due to staff reductions implemented during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year in response to market downturns and decreased shareholder activity 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily as a result of a decrease in sub advisory fees paid for portfolio management of the bonnel growth fund and an overall continued realignment of overhead costs with reduced revenues 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or  in fiscal year over fiscal year largely due to a decrease in sub advisory fees paid for management of the bonnel growth fund and a decrease in travel and training expenses incurred on behalf of company personnel 
these decreases were offset by increased professional fees and leasing costs associated with equipment and computers 
marketing and distribution 
fiscal year marketing and distribution expenses increased by approximately  or  over fiscal year the net increase was due to a decreased percentage of marketing costs that were reimbursed by b plans adopted by the funds despite an overall reduction in marketing costs 
fiscal year marketing and distribution expenses decreased by approximately  or  over fiscal year the net decrease was due to an overall reduction of marketing expenditures as well as an increased percentage of marketing costs that were reimbursed by b plans adopted by the funds 
the company expects that marketing and distribution costs for fiscal year will approximate fiscal year levels 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expenses decreased by approximately  or  in fiscal year from due to existing assets becoming fully depreciated without being replaced with additional capital purchases 
depreciation expenses decreased by approximately  or  in fiscal year from fiscal year due to the company s decision to lease its computer equipment 
as such  fully depreciated assets were replaced by operating leases 
interest and finance 
interest and finance charges are incurred primarily from a note payable on the company s building 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately  or  in fiscal year from fiscal year and the decrease in interest expense of  or  in fiscal year from fiscal year were due to the continued amortization of the note payable as well as the reduction of rates negotiated in fiscal year income taxes provisions for income taxes include deferred taxes for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and tax purposes  resulting from the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
for federal income tax purposes at june   the company has net operating losses nols of approximately million  which will expire between fiscal and  charitable contribution carryovers of approximately  expiring between fiscal and  and alternative minimum tax credits of  with indefinite expirations 
certain changes in the company s ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of nols that could be utilized under section of the internal revenue code 
if certain changes in the company s ownership occur subsequent to june   there could be an annual limitation on the amount of nols that could be utilized 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax amount will not be realized 
as such  management has included a valuation allowance of approximately  and  at june   and  respectively  providing for the utilization of nols  charitable contributions  and investment tax credits against future taxable income 
the company increased its valuation allowance due to an overall evaluation of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources at year end  the company had net working capital current assets minus current liabilities of approximately million and a current ratio of to with approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and almost million in unencumbered marketable securities  the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current debt obligations 
total shareholders equity was approximately million  with cash  cash equivalents  and unencumbered marketable securities comprising of total assets 
with the exception of operating expenses  the company s only material commitment is the mortgage on its corporate headquarters 
the company also has access to a million credit facility  which can be utilized for working capital purposes 
the company s available working capital and potential cash flow are expected to be sufficient to cover current expenses  including debt service 
the investment advisory and related contracts between the company and usgif and usgaf will expire on february   and may   respectively 
management anticipates the trustees of both usgif and usgaf will renew the contracts 
management believes current cash reserves  financing obtained and or available  and potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash needs or capital necessary for the above mentioned activities and allow the company to take advantage of investment opportunities whenever available 
market risk disclosures the company s balance sheet includes assets whose fair value is subject to market risks 
due to the company s investments in equity securities  equity price fluctuations represent a market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or  if not actively traded  management s estimate of fair value as of the balance sheet date 
market prices fluctuate  and the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from the reported market value 
the company s investment activities are reviewed and monitored by company compliance personnel  and various reports are provided to investment advisory clients 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risks as of june   and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices 
fair value at hypothetical estimated fair increase value after decrease in hypothetical shareholders june  percentage change price change equity trading securities  increase   decrease   available for sale  increase   decrease   the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
results could be much worse due to both the nature of equity markets and the concentration of the company s investment portfolio
