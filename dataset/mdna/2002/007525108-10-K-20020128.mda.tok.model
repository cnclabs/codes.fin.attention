table of contents foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of our operation of european subsidiaries  the functional currencies of which are the french franc  german mark and british pound sterling 
all monetary assets are translated into the functional currencies on the financial statements of these subsidiaries 
some us dollar receivables and payables in these subsidiaries offset each other to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
for large sales denominated in other currencies  we attempt to implement appropriate hedging strategies 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
our net sales of million in fiscal grew by million or over net sales of million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to strong sales growth of faststor and scalar products to oem customers 
total revenue from branded products remained materially consistent with fiscal  however  the mix of branded revenue shifted in towards our larger products

in fiscal  sales to a single oem customer accounted for million 
net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales outside the united states in fiscal is due to an oem customer for whom we maintain a revolver warehouse outside the united states

the rapid acceleration of oem sales has had a negative effect on gross margin in fiscal in the long term we expect that the reduction in gross margin due to the increased oem sales will be offset by lower sales and marketing costs 
we believe that the product mix and production costs for our oem business will improve as our newer  multi product oem relationships mature and as our business continues to shift to higher value added products 
selling and administrative expenses 
in fiscal  selling and administrative expenses were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for fiscal selling and administrative expenses have increased in absolute dollars as we continue to launch new products and pursue and penetrate new sales channels 
the percentage decrease is due to the increase in oem sales  which generally have lower related sales and marketing costs

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal research and development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in both absolute dollars and percent is related to added headcount  additional spending related to new products and maintaining heavy investment in software and hardware product development

fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal strong sales growth of faststor and scalar products in both branded and oem business accounted for most of the growth

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar  and are translated in us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date

impact of european monetary conversion we are aware of the issues associated with the changes in europe resulting from the formation of a european economic and monetary union 
one change resulting from this union required european monetary union  or emu  member states to irrevocably fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro  as of january   at which date the euro became a functional legal currency of these countries 
during the next three years  business in the emu member states was conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the french franc or the german mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating or conducting business in emu member states need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
we committed to the worldwide implementation of a fully integrated enterprise resource planning information system 
the system was implemented in europe in december and provides us the capability to meet the requirements of the emu 
the majority of the costs of this system were incurred in connection with the north america installation 
additional costs for the system implementation in europe approximated
