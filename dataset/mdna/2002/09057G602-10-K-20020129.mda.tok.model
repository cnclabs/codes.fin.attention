statements looking forward in time are included in this annual report pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein 
overview we are a regional clinical laboratory with subspecialty testing capabilities 
as a regional laboratory  we service the new york metropolitan area  and currently do business in most new york state counties  as well as in most of new jersey and some parts of pennsylvania and connecticut 
as a regional laboratory  we primarily offer laboratory services to physician offices in these areas with an infrastructure that includes a comprehensive logistical department  extensive phlebotomy services and phlebotomy draw stations scattered around our geographic area 
we have also developed expertise in certain testing areas with specific emphasis in cancer pathology and diagnostics as well as molecular diagnostics 
these services are marketed as a business unit  called genpath  which services customers outside of routine physician office testing 
we have developed certain specialized markets  such as in the areas of correctional health  substance abuse testing  fertility testing and molecular diagnostics 
testing in these areas also may be supported outside of physician office services 
during the last few years  the fundamentals of the industry have been improving 
in the cost containment era of the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the rapid growth of managed care  stringent government regulation and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial clinical laboratories 
as a result  fewer but larger clinical laboratories emerged which have greater economies of scale  compliance with government billing regulation and other laws and a better approach to pricing their services 
these changes resulted in improved profitability 
also  a significant slow down in the growth of managed care and a decrease in the influence by managed care organizations brought about by the clinton administration on the ordering of clinical testing by providers has caused a growth in testing volumes 
our psimedica business unit is a clinical knowledge management ckm system that uses data derived from various sources to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the source data consists of enrollment demographic data  claims data  pharmacy data  laboratory results data  and any other data that may be available 
the system uses sophisticated algorithms to cleanse and configure the data so that analysis can be comprehensive and meaningful 
the data is maintained on multiple levels of analysis enabling review of data from the global level to the most minute transactional detail 
the system includes a base set of queries that provide basic functionality and allows on line real time ad hoc query capability enabling the user to customize analysis to the best needs of the organization using the system 
in addition to the basic queries provided by the system  psimedica quality indicators pqi provide comprehensive  disease state oriented queries that disclose the quality and efficiency of the care and service 
these indicators have been designed to provide the customer with standards and outcome predictors based on a medical standards basis 
during fiscal  we completed development of certain psimedica programs 
these programs are designed to provide information intelligence and intervention programs to healthcare entities thereby enabling such entities to achieve cost effectiveness and to promote improved healthcare 
our psimedica programs are currently being marketed to businesses such as health plans  integrated delivery networks  disease management companies  insurers  clinical trial companies and other healthcare providers that most benefit from the ability of the system to combine both clinical and administrative analysis 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we executed a joint marketing agreement with a prescription benefit manager which provides prescription benefit management services to more than health and welfare funds 
the chairman of the board of the prescription benefit manager is the brother of our chief executive officer 
previously  the prescription benefit manager had transmitted certain data and support data to us to assist in our development of our psimedica products 
pursuant to the joint marketing agreement  the prescription benefit manager agreed to assist us over the next five years in obtaining contracts for the sale of our psimedica programs to its customers and to continue to provide customer data and support data to us on an on going basis 
in consideration therefore  we issued  shares of our common stock to the prescription benefit manager 
to date  psimedica has generated minimal revenues 
careevolve  our wholly owned subsidiary  is a physician based connectivity portal 
it has been built as a highly flexible  scalable  comprehensive desktop solution for physicians to manage their day to day practice and personal needs 
we have further designed this product to work as a platform with plug and play capability 
the underlying philosophy behind the system is that healthcare is local and that the physician must be enabled to provide customized local solutions 
this system is currently being used by us as an internet solution for the distribution of laboratory services 
it is being marketed to our physicians to encourage them to upgrade to the full service subscription package  as well as to non customers on a subscription basis 
careevolve provides physician patient and physician payor electronic communications services 
the careevolve system is designed to communicate laboratory orders and results  e mail prescriptions and refills  establish payor eligibility  process payment claims  manage disease programs for specified disease states and provide other physician services collectively the careevolve services 
we believe that the primary usefulness of the careevolve services has been proven 
at the end of fiscal  we were not yet marketing the care evolve services commercially  but were in negotiation with strategic partners with marketing and distribution capacity to market and distribute the careevolve services to clinical laboratories throughout the united states 
effective december   we executed a strategic marketing alliance agreement with roche diagnostics corporation roche 
pursuant to the strategic marketing alliance agreement  roche agreed to advance million to careevolve to fund careevolve s ongoing operating expenses as approved by a six man steering committee consisting of three roche designees and our three designees 
roche agreed during the five year term of the agreement to provide certain of its managerial marketing personnel for training by care evolve and to cause these personnel to market the careevolve services along with roche services and products 
in addition  roche agreed to cause its sales personnel to exercise reasonable efforts to market and sell the careevolve services 
we agreed that we will cause our personnel and careevolve personnel to also exercise reasonable efforts to market and sell the careevolve services 
we have agreed to share any net after tax income generated through the sale  licensing or commercialization of the careevolve services during the term of the strategic marketing alliance agreement on a basis with roche 
the strategic marketing alliance agreement can be terminated a at any time upon the mutual written agreement of the parties  b on the first or on any subsequent anniversary of the date of the agreement by either party  c by a non breaching party in the event of a material breach by the other party  d by either party in the event of the insolvency of the other party  e by roche if our vendor agreement with med unite which allows careevolve physician subscribers to access certain on line med unite services including on line claims eligibility and claims processing expires or is terminated for any reason  and f in the event of a steering committee deadlock which can not be resolved 
if roche terminates the agreement for any of the causes set forth in c d or e above  or if we terminate the agreement pursuant to b above effective during the first two years  or if either of us terminates the agreement pursuant to f above within the first two years  roche is entitled to be repaid an amount equal to all monies it advanced to careevolve less all careevolve operating expenses approved by the steering committee and paid prior to termination 
in addition  in the event of any such termination  roche shall be entitled to of the net after tax income generated through sales  licensing or commercialization of the careevolve services to roche accounts until the later of five years after execution of the agreement or two years after termination 
in the event we terminate the agreement pursuant to b above within the first two years  roche is automatically granted an irrevocable  worldwide  perpetual royalty free nonexclusive license to use the careevolve services 
roche has also been granted an option during the term of the agreement to purchase an up to equity interest in careevolve from us at fair market value at the time of exercise of the option as well as a right of first refusal in connection with any proposed sale by us of careevolve 
roche has also been granted the option during the term of the agreement to initiate negotiations to purchase a minority investment in us and we have agreed to negotiate in good faith if roche initiates such negotiations 
at the present time  there is no indication that roche intends to exercise any such option 
in september  we announced that we entered a preferred marketing agreement with visible genetics  inc to offer the visible genetics trugene tm hiv genotyping test to our customers treating patients with hiv infections 
it is our belief  after a thorough review of scientific evidence  that this product provides the most informative  valuable and accurate testing available for aids patients at this time 
through our strong presence in the new york metropolitan area s hiv patient care market  together with our leading position in the prison health market in the eastern united states  we will be able to deliver the product to areas where it is highly needed 
we have held the contract for the new york state prison system for the past three years and we are substantially expanding our operations into this highly undervalued area of correctional institution healthcare services 
during the fiscal year ended october   we signed contracts with prison health services phs to service the following correctional facilities rikers island jail nyc and nyc borough detention centers eastern pennsylvania prisons philadelphia pa city jails in addition  we have renewed the union nj county jail  the passaic nj county jail  and the ocean nj county jail contracts

credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising the client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables  however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable 
while we maintain what we believe to be an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  there can be no assurance that our ongoing review of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional reserves 
such additional reserves could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

new authoritative pronouncements the fasb has issued statement no 
 business combination  statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in june these statements will change the accounting for business combinations and goodwill in two significant ways 
first  statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method is now prohibited 
second  statement changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
thus  amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption of that statement  which for the company became effective on november  statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations also issued in june  requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement legal obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement retains the requirements of sfas no 
but removes goodwill from its scope and describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach in evaluating possible future cash flows to be used in impairment testing 
provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years
