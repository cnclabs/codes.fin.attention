commitments in june  the company entered into an operating lease agreement with a special purpose entity for the use of land  existing office buildings  improvements  as well as the development of data center facilities in plano  texas 
this special purpose entity is a trust that is owned by a consortium of financial institutions  and the company has no equity ownership and no managerial involvement in this entity 
the initial term of this lease extends through june  with one optional two year renewal period 
at the end of the lease  the company is required to either renew the lease  purchase the property for the lease balance  or arrange for the sale of the property to a third party  with the company guaranteeing to the lessor proceeds on such sale of of the original fair value of the land  plus of the original fair value of the buildings and any additional improvements 
the fair value of the facilities  upon completion of certain construction activities  is expected to be approximately million 
rent expense under this operating lease is equal to the interest expense owed by the special purpose entity to the banks and is a variable amount equal to libor plus basis points at december  on approximately million 
management believes this lease rate is less than prevailing market lease rates for similar facilities 
the company does not consolidate this entity 
if accounting rules were to change and the company was required to consolidate this entity  assets and debt would increase by approximately million and the company would incur an additional depreciation charge of approximately million per year 
this lease contains certain standard financial covenants which  if not met  may require the company to repay the approximately million to the special purpose entity 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance 
if the company were ever required to repay the approximately million  then this payment would be recorded as the purchase of land  buildings  and improvements  which the company is currently leasing 
as a result of such payment  the company would record an asset on its consolidated balance sheet of approximately million and would incur an additional depreciation charge of approximately million per year 
as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company may be required to repurchase shares of its class a common stock under a certain stock agreement and has other commitments under operating leases for data processing facilities  office space and computer equipment

during  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of ars 
the purchase price consists of cash payments of million and possible additional payments totaling up to million over the next three years 
the possible future payments are contingent on ars achieving certain financial targets over the same period 
ars achieved its financial targets for and is due a million payment during the first quarter of at the company s discretion  up to of this payment may be settled in class a common stock of the company valued at the date of settlement 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company provides services under level of effort  fixed price  and unit price contracts  with the length of contracts ranging up to twelve years 
revenue from level of effort contracts is based on time and materials  direct costs plus an administrative fee which may be either a fixed amount or a percent of direct costs incurred  or a combination of these methods and may be based on a set fee for a specified level of resources that is adjusted for incremental resource usage 
for unit price contracts  the company establishes a per unit fee based on the cost structure associated with the delivery of that unit of service 
revenue under these contracts is recognized when the company performs the services in accordance with contractual performance standards 
customer prepayments are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed 
for fixed price contracts  the company recognizes revenue and profit as these contracts progress using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue and profit recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and profit 
when estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract on completion  a provision for the expected loss is recorded in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  or unbilled revenue  on uncompleted fixed price contracts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are included in other non current assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
based upon the company s estimates of future taxable income and review of available tax planning strategies  management determined that it is more likely than not that only million of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of million relating to certain foreign jurisdictions 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
the company has used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include increased competition and a decline in sales or margins 
accounting standards issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fas  business combinations and fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas provides guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination completed after june   and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  fas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  and instead requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company will apply fas beginning in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of fas is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per dilutive share in consistent with the treatment of intangible assets with indefinite lives under fas  the company will reclassify an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of million along with a related deferred tax liability of million at december   to goodwill at the date of adoption 
the company will test goodwill for impairment as of january   in the first quarter of the results of such tests are not expected to impact earnings

the company is required to adopt fas no later than january  the company believes that the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
financial accounting standards emerging issues task force issue in november  the financial accounting standards board emerging task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
this eitf consensus concludes that consideration from a vendor to a customer is a reduction of the selling price of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement 
companies are required to adopt eitf for fiscal years beginning after december   and are required to reclassify all prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation
