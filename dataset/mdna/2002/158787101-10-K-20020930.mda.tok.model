item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview as of june   we owned and operated upscale casual dining restaurants in states and had restaurants operating under franchise or license agreements in five states 
our restaurants offer an extensive and varied menu in each of four distinct day parts lunch  mid afternoon  dinner and late night 
we believe that the flexibility of our multiple day part model  the diversity and quality of our freshly prepared menu items  our unique entertainment and uncompromising service have created an attractive  high sales volume restaurant model that provides us with considerable growth opportunities to develop our brand nationwide 
the original champps concept began operations in and grew to eight restaurants by december in  william h 
baumhauer  the chief executive officer and president of daka international  inc  a large publicly traded food service management and restaurant company  led daka s purchase of champps as an addition to daka s portfolio of restaurant concepts 
as part of a corporate restructuring in  daka spun off its restaurant business  which included champps and several other businesses including fuddruckers restaurants  to daka s shareholders as a new company called unique casual restaurants  inc during and the first half of  unique casual restaurants sold or closed its businesses other than champps and changed its name to champps entertainment  inc shortly thereafter  mr 
baumhauer  who had left the daka organization in may  was recruited back to champps as president and chief executive officer 
upon his return  mr 
baumhauer hired a new management team  consolidated our headquarters  implemented procedures to improve operational and financial reporting procedures  standardized the purchasing process and established new employee training and retention practices 
as a result of the changes we implemented following mr 
baumhauer s return in  our restaurant level operating profit increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a percent of restaurant sales  our restaurant level operating margin increased from in fiscal to in fiscal our ebitda increased from a negative million in fiscal to a positive million in fiscal in addition  our income from continuing operations increased from a negative million in fiscal to a positive million in fiscal our restaurants open throughout fiscal generated average unit sales of approximately million  among the highest in the casual dining industry 
as a result of our existing high unit volumes  we do not expect that increases in comparable restaurant sales will provide significant sources for overall growth in our revenue  and our comparable restaurant sales will continue to fluctuate over time 
instead  we anticipate that our disciplined expansion strategy will be the principal driver for our future growth 
we opened six restaurants in fiscal and expect to open eight to ten restaurants in fiscal and ten to restaurants in fiscal we believe that there are significant opportunities to expand our concept both in our existing markets and in new markets throughout the united states 
the majority of our growth will be in existing markets  which will enable us to leverage costs and gain efficiencies associated with regional supervision  marketing  purchasing and hiring in these markets 
our growth strategy will have several impacts on our financial results  in addition to increases in our restaurant sales 
as we open more restaurants  our aggregate pre opening expense will increase 
pre opening expense has historically been approximately million per location 
because our openings will not necessarily be spaced evenly throughout a fiscal year  our pre opening expense will fluctuate  possibly significantly  on a quarterly basis 
in addition  new restaurants tend to have higher operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales than do more established restaurants  which will impact negatively our overall operating margins in periods following large numbers of restaurant openings 
on the other hand  because a substantial portion of our general and administrative expense does not increase proportionately with increases in restaurant sales and because we believe that our corporate infrastructure is substantially in place to support our planned growth  we expect that general and administrative expense as a percentage of restaurant sales will be positively impacted over time as we grow our restaurant base 
we are not pursuing new franchise arrangements as part of our growth strategy and do not expect franchising and royalty revenue to be significant in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
items significantly impacted by estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  representations  warranties and indemnities provided in connection with the spin off of our business by daka international  inc in and the subsequent sale of our fuddruckers business unit in  the useful lives and recoverability of our long lived assets such as property  equipment and intangibles  fair value attributed to assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  realization of our deferred tax assets  self insured risks relating to workers compensation and general liability claims  legal liabilities and employee benefits 
loss contingencies we maintain accrued liabilities and reserves relating to the resolution of certain contingent obligations and reserves for self insurance 
significant contingencies include those related to litigation and state tax assessments 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
those contingencies that are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the best estimate within that range  if none of the estimates within that range is better than another  we accrue to the low end of the range 
we determine reserves for self insurance based on the insurance companies incurred loss estimates and management s judgment 
the assessment of contingencies is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of contingencies may differ materially from amounts we have accrued in our financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and related identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
beginning in fiscal  we evaluate impairment of goodwill and other unidentifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we are required to assess impairment at least annually by means of a fair value based test 
at june   we evaluated our goodwill and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates related to our business and is highly subjective 
actual amounts realized through operations or upon disposition of related assets may differ significantly from our estimate 
leases we lease most of our properties including our corporate office 
we account for our leases under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for leases and subsequent amendments which requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  the company records the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and records the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments tenant improvement allowances received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
future authoritative changes to the methods of accounting for leases could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying value for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities  resulting from a change in tax rates  is recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit in the period that such change occurs 
net operating loss and other credit carryforwards  including fica tip tax credits and targeted jobs tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded for the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized based on projected future taxable income 
as of june   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
as a result of our improved profitability  we have determined that more likely than not we will be able to realize million of these net deferred tax assets through the generation of future taxable income in the next three years 
the change in the valuation allowance takes into account actual current year taxable income and any adjustments to the three year taxable income forecast 
net deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss and other credit carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
as of june   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  expiring at various dates through our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
financial definitions revenue 
our revenue is comprised of restaurant sales  and net franchise royalties and fees 
our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  with less than of the restaurant sales represented by sales of champps merchandise and other revenue

restaurant level operating profit increased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal compared with million for the comparable prior period 
restaurant level operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable prior period 
the decrease was due to higher expenses associated with the opening of six new restaurants in fiscal plus three new restaurants in late fiscal the income generated from new restaurants is typically lower during the first four months of operation compared to an existing restaurant 
in addition  lower comparable restaurant sales resulted in a higher percentage of fixed expenses during fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable prior period 
the increase was largely due to the addition of support personnel 
however  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable prior period due to the larger revenue base in fiscal pre opening expense 
pre opening expense increased million to million during fiscal from million for the comparable prior period

pre opening expense has historically been approximately million per location 
interest expense and income  net 
interest expense and income  net increased million to million from million in the prior period primarily due to interest expense on additional debt partially offset by increased capitalized interest from higher construction spending

net income before provision for income taxes 
net income before provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily for the reasons described above 
during fiscal  million was added to reserves for predecessor company obligations and discontinued operations 
provision for income tax benefit expense 
for fiscal year  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million related to the recognition of a portion of our deferred tax asset 
we recorded a provision for state and local income taxes of million for fiscal financial condition and liquidity the working capital needs of companies engaged in the restaurant industry are generally low as sales are made for cash  and purchases of food and supplies and other operating expenses are generally paid in to days after receipt of invoices and labor costs are paid bi weekly 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our operations and expansion have been net cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of the fuddruckers business in and standard restaurant financing methods  such as build to suit transactions  sale leaseback transactions  mortgage facilities  notes payable  tenant improvement allowances and equipment financing 
capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in april and june  we entered into an aggregate of million in term loans with finova capital corporation that allowed us to purchase two existing franchise restaurants located in eden prairie  minnesota and minnetonka  minnesota  as well as provide mortgage financing for the construction of our lombard  illinois restaurant 
the finova capital term loans bear interest at a fixed rate of for a million loan and for two loans of million each  and are amortized over a year period with a balloon payment due may the term loans require that we maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the finova capital term loans also contain covenants that  subject to specified exceptions  restrict our ability to incur additional debt  incur liens  engage in mergers or acquisitions  incur contingent liabilities  make dividends or distributions  pay indebtedness for borrowed money  make investments or loans and sell assets  develop new restaurants  change facility sites  sell or transfer assets  amend specified agreements  acquire additional properties  issue capital stock and engage in transactions with affiliates 
as of the date of this filing  we are in compliance with all financial ratios and covenants 
the finova capital term loans are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the property related to these restaurants 
between december and february  we entered into two term loans collateralized by equipment with general electric capital business asset funding corporation ge capital 
as of june   we had approximately million outstanding under these term loans 
these loans bear interest at the day commercial paper rate  plus as of june   and mature between december and february the ge capital loans require that we maintain a maximum debt to net worth ratio  a minimum debt coverage ratio  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization compared to debt and a maximum funded indebtedness ratio 
we were in compliance with all of these financial ratios as of june  at june   our unrestricted cash was million and restricted cash was million 
restricted cash includes certificates of deposits to serve as cash collateral for stand by letters of credit and are classified as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we anticipate that our operations will continue to generate positive operating cash flow for fiscal however  there are also significant cash expenditures anticipated related to the opening of new restaurants and the remodeling and improvements of existing restaurants 
at september   the company had executed a proposal for an additional million term loan collateralized with equipment with ge capital 
the company is currently under credit review by ge capital 
these funds are intended to be used for the construction of the eight to ten restaurants in fiscal the company is also investigating other sources of financing at this time 
in the event that such financing is not available  the company has the ability to curtail its expansion program and reduce non essential operating costs to conserve working capital 
during fiscal  we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million 
during the same period  we received million associated primarily with the proceeds from the ge capital term loans of million and landlord contributions in the form of tenant improvement allowances totaling million 
during fiscal  we opened six restaurants 
for fiscal  total capital expenditures for new restaurants were approximately million and million for renovations to existing restaurants and corporate upgrades 
this amount is partially offset from receipts from equipment capital leases of million 
during fiscal  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million 
during the same period  we received million primarily from the sale leaseback of our las colinas  texas restaurant for million and million from the sale of a former fuddruckers restaurant location 
during fiscal  we opened four restaurants 
total capital expenditures for new restaurants during fiscal were approximately million before the receipt of million from a tenant improvement note payable in fiscal capital expenditures for remodels and improvements to existing restaurants were approximately million in fiscal during fiscal  we anticipate opening eight to ten restaurants 
as of september   we have opened two restaurants  begun construction on three restaurants and have signed leases for six additional restaurants 
we have identified multiple sites and are negotiating contracts on several sites for the remaining restaurants scheduled to open in fiscal our capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million for new restaurants and million for remodeling and improvements in existing restaurants 
these expenditures will be funded through our unrestricted cash  cash flow from existing operations  tenant improvement allowances and additional financing 
we anticipate the receipt of tenant improvement allowances to offset these capital expenditures in the approximate amount of million to million in fiscal we also anticipate that we will make cash payments in fiscal associated with liabilities previously recorded in fiscal and for prior year insurance claims  tax audits and legal settlements related to our indemnification obligations arising from our spin off from daka and the fuddruckers sale transaction 
during fiscal  we made payments of million and in fiscal  we made additional payments of million to reduce these liabilities 
anticipated expenditures for these liabilities are estimated to range between million to million for  based upon current estimates 
we believe the proceeds from additional financing and tenant improvement allowances  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment and expansion at least through fiscal however  changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item business risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business 
contractual obligations and commitments payments  including interest  due by period as of june  in s one year and two to three four to after five contractual total less years five years years obligations operating leases      capital leases    notes payable      we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for our restaurants and headquarters 
the fixed terms of the restaurant leases range up to years and generally contain multiple renewal options for various periods ranging from five to years 
our restaurant leases also contain provisions that require additional payments based on sales performance and the payment of common area maintenance charges and real estate taxes 
amounts in this table do not reflect any of these additional amounts 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  alcoholic beverages and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant associates are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements prohibited pooling of interests accounting for transactions initiated after june   require the use of the purchase method of accounting for all combinations after june  and establish new standards for accounting for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in business combinations 
goodwill will continue to be recognized as an asset  but will not be amortized as previously required by apb opinion no 
intangible assets 
certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives  if present  may also not be amortized 
instead  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will be subject to periodic at least annual tests for impairment and recognition of impairment losses in the future could be required 
the revised standards include transition rules and requirements for identification  valuation and recognition of a much broader list of intangibles as part of business combinations than prior practice  most of which will continue to be amortized if determined to have a finite life 
at june   we evaluated our goodwill and determined that the goodwill was not impaired 
our financial statements may be affected by the results of future periodic tests for impairment 
goodwill amortization was  and none in and  respectively 
the company did not amortize goodwill in with the adoption of sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not currently have any obligations falling under the scope of sfas no 
 and therefore does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of  and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas no 
is effective beginning in fiscal  but is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
is generally effective for the company for fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and issue no 
relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost as defined in that issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosures the market risk exposure inherent in the company s financial instruments and consolidated financial position represents the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to such interest rate risk primarily in its significant investment in cash and cash equivalents and the use of fixed and variable rate debt to fund its acquisitions of property and equipment in past years and the implicit interest rates in the company s sale leaseback arrangements 
market risk for cash and cash equivalents and fixed rate borrowings is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the assets or obligations resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in interest rates  which would not have been significant to the company s financial position or results of operations during fiscal the effect of a similar hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt and the investment rates implicit in the company s sale leaseback arrangements also would have been insignificant due to the immaterial amounts of borrowings outstanding under the company s credit arrangements
