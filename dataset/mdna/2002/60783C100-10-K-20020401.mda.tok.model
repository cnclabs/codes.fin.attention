petersburg  florida facilities 
in and  the majority of expenditures were as a result of expanding production capacity at the company s various facilities 
management believes that the company s existing product lines and manufacturing capacity will enable the company to generate sufficient cash through operations  supplemented by the company s bank line of credit  to finance the company s business over the next twelve months 
however  additional cash resources may be required if the company s rate of growth exceeds currently anticipated levels 
moreover  it may prove necessary for the company to construct or acquire additional manufacturing facilities in order for the company to compete effectively in new market areas or states which are beyond a mile radius from one of its production facilities 
the construction or acquisition of new facilities could require significant additional capital 
for these reasons  among others  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in the future 
there can be  however  no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing  or that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to it 
commitments and contingencies the following table represents a comprehensive list of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year amounts in thousands total thereafter long term debt       operating leases     total contractual cash obligations        critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our most critical accounting policies related to allowance for contract adjustments revenue recognition on construction contracts we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas requires that the purchase method be used for business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead reviewed for impairment 
under sfas  the amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of the statement and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which for calendar year end companies  will be january  the company has historically amortized its goodwill over its estimated useful lives 
beginning with the adoption of sfas  the company will cease amortizing its goodwill 
the company recorded goodwill amortization expense in the amount of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
to the extent that no impairment charges are recorded upon adoption or application of sfas  similar amounts of amortization will not be recorded in future periods 
the company is currently analyzing the impact of adopting sfas and has not determined whether the adoption will have a material impact on the company s financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
management has not assessed whether the application of this standard will have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management has not assessed whether the application of this standard will have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
seasonality historically  the company s quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
the company has typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
the company s first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  the company s operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
inflation during the past three years  the company has not been adversely affected by inflation  because it has been generally able to pass along to its customers increases in the costs of labor and materials 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuation in interest rates on our million credit facility 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the carrying value of the credit facility approximates fair value as the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at libor plus additional interest of between and  or the federal funds rate plus additional interest of between to 
the additional interest charge is based upon certain financial ratios 
we estimate that the average amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility for will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of  for the year
