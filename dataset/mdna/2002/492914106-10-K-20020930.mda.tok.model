business strategy key has built its leadership position through the consolidation of smaller  less viable competitors 
this consolidation  together with a continuing decline in the number of available domestic well service rigs due to attrition  cannibalization and transfers outside of the united states  has given key the opportunity to strengthen its position within the industry during fiscal and key has focused on maximizing results by reducing debt  building strong customer alliances  refurbishing rigs and related equipment  and training personnel to maintain a qualified and safe employee base 
reducing debt 
over the past fiscal year  key has significantly reduced debt and strengthened its balance sheet 
at june   key s long term funded debt net of cash and capitalized leases net funded debt was approximately  and its net funded debt to capitalization ratio was approximately as compared to approximately  and  respectively  at june  key expects to be able to continue to reduce debt from available cash flow from operations and from anticipated interest savings resulting from prior and future debt reductions and future debt refinancings 
building strong customer alliances 
key seeks to maximize customer satisfaction by offering a broad range of equipment and services combined with a highly trained and motivated labor force 
as a result  key is able to offer proactive solutions for most of its customer s wellsite needs 
key ensures consistent high standards of quality and customer satisfaction by continually evaluating its performance 
key maintains strong alliances with major oil companies as well as numerous independent oil and natural gas production companies and believes that such alliances improve the stability of demand for its oilfield services 
refurbishing rigs and related equipment 
key intends to continue actively refurbishing its rigs and related equipment to maximize the utilization of its rig fleet 
the increase in key s cash flow  both from operations and from anticipated interest savings from reduced levels of debt  combined with key s borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility  has provided ample liquidity and resources necessary to make the capital expenditures to refurbish such equipment 
training and developing employees 
key has  and will continue to  devote significant resources to the training and professional development of its employees with a special emphasis on safety 
key currently has two training centers in texas and one training center in california to improve its employees understanding of operating and safety procedures 
key recognizes the historically high turn over rate in the industry and is committed to offering compensation  benefits and incentive programs for its employees that are attractive and competitive in its industry  in order to ensure a steady stream of qualified  safe personnel to provide quality service to its customers 
major developments during and subsequent to fiscal depressed industry conditions operating conditions declined significantly during fiscal as capital spending by oil and natural gas producers for well servicing and contract drilling services decreased from prior year levels 
the decreased spending was primarily due to lower commodity prices and the perception by the company s customers that commodity prices will decrease further with wti cushing prices for light sweet crude averaging approximately per barrel and nymex henry hub natural gas prices averaging approximately per mmbtu during fiscal  as compared to an average wti cushing price for light sweet crude of per barrel and an average nymex henry hub natural gas price of per mmbtu during fiscal the lower commodity prices during fiscal led to a rapid decrease in the demand for key s services and equipment beginning in the december quarter as key s customers reduced their exploration and development activity in key s primary market areas 
beginning in late calendar  rising natural gas inventories and the prospect of a slowing economy caused concern in the commodity markets which resulted in a steady decline in commodity prices 
the lower commodity prices  along with the change in market sentiment  forced some of our customers to reduce delay their capital spending plans 
despite the decline in activity  key was successful in minimizing rate concessions  however  the decrease in demand and moderately lower rates resulted in sequential decreases in revenues  cash flow and net income in the last three quarters of fiscal over the same quarters of fiscal key expects demand for its services to gradually improve from its existing levels as commodity prices have improved with wti cushing prices averaging per barrel and nymex henry hub natural gas prices averaging per mmbtu during the month of august despite the decline from fiscal  crude oil prices continued to trade at healthy levels during fiscal due largely to the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to adhere to its production quotas designed to keep crude oil prices in the range of to per barrel 
the adherence to the production quotas brought more stability to crude oil prices  however  between november and february  crude oil prices did decline and averaged less than per barrel 
the decline in pricing led many oil and gas producers to reduce their capital spending until such time that commodity prices recovered 
since february  crude oil prices have strengthened due to concerns of a potential middle east conflict  lower oil inventories and the prospects of an improving economy 
during this same period  natural gas prices have also improved 
since february  nymex henry hub prices have improved to per mmbtu from per mmbtu 
despite today s strong commodity prices  activity continues to remain modest  although the company has experienced slight improvements in rig hours during the past few months 
while management believes that many of its customers generally base their capital spending budgets on a crude oil price of to per barrel and a natural gas price of to per mmbtu  there can be no assurances that its customers will not postpone and or reduce their capital spending plans if crude oil prices and natural gas prices continue to remain at or below their current levels 
assuming no further weakening in the us economy and a normal winter in the united states  management believes that activity levels should improve during calendar the level of key s revenues  cash flows  losses and earnings are substantially dependent upon  and affected by  the level of domestic and international oil and gas exploration and development activity see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition debt reduction during fiscal  key significantly reduced its long term debt and strengthened its balance sheet 
at june   key s net funded debt was approximately  and its net funded debt to capitalization ratio was approximately as compared to approximately  and  respectively  at june  proceeds from the equity offering defined below and the debt offering defined below  as well as cash flow from operations were used to accomplish this reduction in net funded debt see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition long term debt 
equity offering on december   the company closed a public offering of  shares of common stock  yielding approximately million  or per share  to the company  the equity offering 
net proceeds from the equity offering of approximately million were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit 
the net proceeds of the equity offering were ultimately used in january to redeem a portion of the company s senior subordinated notes fully utilizing the company s equity claw back rights for up to of the original million issued 
debt offering on march   key completed a public offering of  of senior notes due at of par the debt offering 
the cash proceeds from the public offering  net of fees and expenses  were used to repay the entire balance of the revolving loan facility then outstanding under key s senior credit facility  with the remainder of such proceeds held in cash and ultimately used to retire a portion of q services  inc s long term debt 
egypt project on march   key entered into a multi year contract with apache corporation under which key is providing five newly refurbished well servicing rigs for work on apache concessions in the western desert of the arab republic of egypt 
in addition to the five well servicing rigs  key is also providing apache with ten heavy oilfield service vehicles under the contract 
acquisitions during fiscal  the company completed a series of small acquisitions for total consideration of  which consisted of a combination of cash and shares of the company s common stock

description of business segments key operates in two primary business segments which are well servicing and contract drilling 
key s operations are conducted domestically and in argentina  egypt and canada 
the following is a description of each of these business segments for financial information regarding these business segments  see note to consolidated financial statements business segment information 
well servicing key provides a full range of well services  including rig based services  oilfield trucking services  fishing and rental tool services  pressure pumping services and other ancillary oilfield services  necessary to maintain and workover oil and natural gas producing wells 
rig based services include maintenance of existing wells  workovers of existing wells  completion of newly drilled wells  recompletion of existing wells including horizontal recompletions and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives 
well service rigs key uses its well service rig fleet to perform four major categories of rig services for oil and natural gas producers 
maintenance services 
key estimates that there are approximately  producing oil wells and approximately  producing natural gas wells in the united states 
key provides the well service rigs  equipment and crews for maintenance services  which are performed on both oil and natural gas wells  but which are more commonly required on oil wells 
while some oil wells in the united states flow oil to the surface without mechanical assistance  most require pumping or some other method of artificial lift 
oil wells that require pumping characteristically require more maintenance than flowing wells due to the operation of the mechanical pumping equipment installed 
few natural gas wells have mechanical pumping systems in the wellbore  and  as a result  maintenance work on natural gas wells is less frequent 
maintenance services are required throughout the life of most producing oil and natural gas wells to ensure efficient and continuous operation 
these services consist of routine mechanical repairs necessary to maintain production from the well  such as repairing inoperable pumping equipment in an oil well or replacing defective tubing in an oil or natural gas well  and removing debris such as sand and paraffin from the well 
other services include pulling the rods  tubing  pumps and other downhole equipment out of the wellbore to identify and repair a production problem 
maintenance services are often performed on a series of wells in proximity to each other and typically require less than hours per well to complete 
the general demand for maintenance services is closely related to the total number of producing oil and natural gas wells in a geographic market  and maintenance services are generally the most stable type of well service activity 
workover services 
in addition to periodic maintenance  producing oil and natural gas wells occasionally require major repairs or modifications  called workovers 
workover services are performed to enhance the current production of existing wells 
such services include extensions of existing wells to drain new formations either through deepening wellbores to new zones or through drilling of horizontal lateral wellbores to improve reservoir drainage patterns 
in less extensive workovers  key s rigs are used to seal off depleted zones in existing wellbores and access previously bypassed productive zones 
key s workover rigs are also used to convert former producing wells to injection wells through which water or carbon dioxide is then pumped into the formation for enhanced recovery operations 
other workover services include major subsurface repairs such as casing repair or replacement  recovery of tubing and removal of foreign objects in the wellbore  repairing downhole equipment failures  plugging back the bottom of a well to reduce the amount of water being produced with the oil and natural gas  cleaning out and recompleting a well if production has declined  and repairing leaks in the tubing and casing 
these extensive workover operations are normally performed by a well service rig with a workover package  which may include rotary drilling equipment  mud pumps  mud tanks and blowout preventers depending upon the particular type of workover operation 
most of key s well service rigs are designed for and can be equipped to perform complex workover operations 
workover services are more complex and time consuming than routine maintenance operations and consequently may last from a few days to several weeks 
these services are almost exclusively performed by well service rigs 
the demand for workover services is more sensitive to expectations relating to  and changes in  oil and natural gas prices than the demand for maintenance services 
as oil and natural gas prices increase  the level of workover activity tends to increase as operators seek to increase production by enhancing the efficiency of their wells at higher commodity prices with correspondingly higher rates of return 
completion services 
key s completion services prepare a newly drilled oil or natural gas well for production 
the completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing to access producing zones  stimulating and testing these zones and installing downhole equipment 
key typically provides a well service rig and may also provide other equipment such as a workover package to assist in the completion process 
producers use well service rigs to complete their wells because the rigs have specialized equipment  properly trained employees and the experience necessary to perform these services 
however  during periods of weak drilling rig demand  drilling contractors may compete with service rigs for completion work 
the completion process typically requires a few days to several weeks  depending on the nature and type of the completion  and generally requires additional auxiliary equipment that can be provided for an additional fee 
the demand for well completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels  which are highly sensitive to expectations relating to  and changes in  oil and natural gas prices 
as the number of newly drilled wells decreases  the number of completion jobs correspondingly decreases 
plugging and abandonment services 
well service rigs and workover equipment are also used in the process of permanently closing oil and natural gas wells at the end of their productive lives 
plugging and abandonment work can be performed with a well servicing rig along with wireline and cementing equipment 
the services generally include the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the compensation received and require compliance with state regulatory requirements 
the demand for oil and natural gas does not significantly affect the demand for plugging and abandonment services  as well operators are required by state regulations to plug a well that it is no longer productive 
the need for these services is also driven by lease and or operator policy requirements 
oilfield trucking upon completion of the acquisition of qsi  key has established itself as a leading provider of liquid vacuum truck services and fluid transportation and disposal services for operators whose wells produce saltwater and other fluids  in addition to oil and natural gas 
of the  heavy oilfield service vehicles operated by the company following the acquisition of qsi  the company operates  vacuum and transport trucks in the united states 
in addition  key owns approximately  frac tanks which are used in conjunction with the fluid hauling operations 
fluid hauling trucks are utilized in connection with drilling and workover projects  which tend to produce and use large amounts of various oilfield fluids 
fluid hauling companies transport fresh water to the well site and provide temporary storage and disposal of produced salt water and drilling workover fluids 
these fluids are picked up at the well site and transported for disposal in a salt water disposal well of which key owns approximately in addition  key provides haul equipment trucks that are used to move large pieces of equipment from one wellsite to the next and operates a fleet of hot oilers 
demand and pricing for these services are generally related to demand for key s well service and drilling rigs 
fluid hauling and equipment hauling services are typically priced on a per hour basis while frac tank rentals typically are billed on a per day basis 
well intervention services through its acquisition of qsi in july  key expanded its fishing and rental tool operations and added a pressure pumping business 
these operations comprise key s well intervention services division which is part of the well servicing line of business 
founded in  qsi s fishing and rental tool operation  quality tubular services  inc qts  provides fishing and rental tool services to major and independent oil and natural gas production companies primarily in the gulf coast region of the united states 
qts operates nine hour service locations and four regional sales offices 
the fishing tool supervisors have extensive experience with downhole problems 
in addition  qts offers a full line of services and equipment designed for the harsh elements from land to offshore 
the rental tool inventory consists of tubulars  handling tools  pressure control equipment and a fleet of power swivels 
key also provides fishing and rental tools through its landmark fishing and rental tools operation in the mid continent region and at various locations throughout the country 
key s pressure pumping business operates under the name american energy services  inc aes 
aes provides stimulation services  cementing services  nitrogen services  hydro testing and production chemistry services to oil and natural gas producers 
key offers a full complement of acidizing technology  fracturing technology  nitrogen technology and cementing technology services 
with over  horsepower in cementing and stimulation equipment  aes is one of the largest us providers of pressure pumping services 
aes was established in december and operates in the permian basin  the san juan basin  and the mid continent region 
ancillary oilfield services key provides ancillary oilfield services  which include among others wireline  well site construction  roustabout services  and foam units and air drilling services 
demand and pricing for these services are generally related to demand for key s well service and drilling rigs 
contract drilling key provides contract drilling services to major oil companies and independent oil and natural gas producers onshore the continental united states in the permian basin  the four corners region  michigan  the northeast  and the rocky mountains and internationally in argentina and ontario  canada 
contract drilling services are primarily provided under standard dayrate  and  to a lesser extent  footage or turnkey contracts 
drilling rigs vary in size and capability and may include specialized equipment 
the majority of key s drilling rigs is equipped with mechanical power systems and has depth ratings ranging from approximately  to  feet 
key has one drilling rig with a depth rating of approximately  feet 
like workover services  the demand for contract drilling is directly related to expectations relating to  and changes in  oil and natural gas prices which in turn  are driven by the supply of and demand for these commodities 
foreign operations key also operates each of its business segments discussed above in argentina  ontario  canada and egypt 
key s foreign operations currently own well servicing rigs  oilfield trucks and seven drilling rigs in argentina  four well servicing rigs  four oilfield trucks and two drilling rigs in ontario  canada and five well servicing rigs in the arab republic of egypt 
customers key s customers include major oil companies  independent oil and natural gas production companies  and foreign national oil and natural gas production companies 
one customer in fiscal  occidental petroleum corporation  accounted for of key s consolidated revenues 
competition and other external factors despite the significant consolidation in the domestic well servicing industry  there are numerous smaller companies that compete in key s well servicing markets 
nonetheless  key believes that its performance  equipment  safety  and availability of equipment to meet customer needs and availability of experienced  skilled personnel is superior to that of its competitors 
in the well servicing markets  an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long term customer relationships is having an experienced  skilled and well trained work force 
in recent years  many of key s larger customers have placed increased emphasis on the safety records and quality of the crews  equipment and services provided by their contractors 
key has  and will continue to devote substantial resources toward employee safety and training programs 
management believes that many of key s competitors  particularly small contractors  have not undertaken similar training programs for their employees 
management believes that key s safety record and reputation for quality equipment and service are among the best in the industry 
in the contract drilling market  key competes with other regional and national oil and natural gas drilling contractors  some of which have larger rig fleets with greater average depth capabilities and a few that have better capital resources than key 
management believes that the contract drilling industry is less consolidated than the well servicing industry  resulting in a contract drilling market that is more price competitive 
nonetheless  key believes that it is competitive in terms of drilling performance  equipment  safety  pricing  availability of equipment to meet customer needs and availability of experienced  skilled personnel in those regions in which it operates 
the need for well servicing and contract drilling fluctuates  primarily  in relation to the price of oil and natural gas which  in turn  is driven by the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas 
as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases  service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the producing efficiency of their wells in a higher priced environment 
employees as of june   key employed approximately  persons approximately  employees in its well servicing and contract drilling businesses and approximately employees on its corporate staff 
key s employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
key has not experienced work stoppages associated with labor disputes or grievances and considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
environmental regulations key s operations are subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations intended to protect the environment 
key s operations routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
consequently  the regulations applicable to key s operations include those with respect to containment  disposal and controlling the discharge of any hazardous oilfield waste and other non hazardous waste material into the environment  requiring removal and cleanup under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party 
such laws and regulations may expose key to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others  or for key s acts  which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the times such acts were performed 
cleanup costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws  and costs associated with changes in environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on key s financial condition 
from time to time  claims have been made and litigation has been brought against key under such laws 
however  the costs incurred in connection with such claims and other costs of environmental compliance have not had any material adverse effect on key s operations or financial statements in the past  and management is not currently aware of any situation or condition that it believes is likely to have any such material adverse effect in the future 
management believes that it conducts key s operations in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local regulations as they relate to the environment 
although key has incurred certain costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations  such amounts have not been material to key s financial results during the past three fiscal years

the reclassifications consist primarily of reclassifying certain items from general and administrative expense to direct expense 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal year ended june  the company s results of operations for the year ended june  reflect the impact of a decline in industry conditions resulting from decreased commodity prices and its customers perception that commodity prices may decrease further which in turn caused a decline in demand for the company s equipment and services partially offset by minimizing rate concessions and lower interest charges during fiscal see part i item major developments during fiscal unfavorable industry conditions the company revenues for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal  while net income for fiscal decreased  or  to  from a net income of  in fiscal the decrease in revenues and net income is due to lower levels of activity partially offset by higher pricing  with lower interest expense from debt reduction also contributing to net income 
operating revenues well servicing 
well servicing revenues for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease was due to lower demand for the company s well servicing equipment and services partially offset by higher pricing

operating expenses well servicing 
well servicing expenses for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease in expenses is due to lower activity levels partially offset by higher insurance costs primarily in workers compensation and health care 
despite the decreased costs  well servicing expenses as a percentage of well servicing revenues increased from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily due to the increase in insurance costs 
contract drilling 
contract drilling expenses for the year ended june   decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease is due to lower activity levels partially offset by higher insurance costs primarily in workers compensation and health care 
contract drilling expenses as a percentage of contract drilling revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the margin improvement is due to improved operating efficiencies and the effects of higher pricing partially offset by the increase in insurance costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended june  increased  or  to  from  in fiscal the increase is due to recent acquisitions and increased capital expenditures during the past year as the company continued major refurbishments of well servicing and contract drilling equipment partially offset by discontinued amortization of goodwill  which amounted to  in fiscal  because of the company s adoption of sfas general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease was due to reductions in incentive payroll costs partially offset by additional expenses incurred as a result of moving the corporate headquarters to midland  texas from east brunswick  new jersey and increases in personnel supporting information technology functions 
despite the decreased costs  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense the company s interest expense for the year ended june  decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the company s long term debt using proceeds from the equity offering  the debt offering and operating cash flow  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
included in the interest expense was the amortization of debt issuance costs of  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
foreign currency transaction loss during fiscal  the company recorded an argentine foreign currency transaction loss of approximately  related to dollar denominated receivables resulting from the recent devaluation of argentina s currency

critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates which are sensitive to deviations of actual results from management s assumptions 
in particular  management makes estimates regarding the fair value of the company s reporting units in assessing potential impairment of goodwill 
in addition  the company makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the future use of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing impairment of goodwill  the company has used estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of its reporting units 
actual future results could be different than the estimates and assumptions used 
events or circumstances which might lead to an indication of impairment of goodwill would include  but might not be limited to  prolonged decreases in expectations of long term well servicing and or drilling activity or rates brought about by prolonged decreases in oil or natural gas prices  changes in government regulation of the oil and natural gas industry or other events which could affect the level of activity of exploration and production companies 
in assessing impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill where there has been a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  the company has estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from use of the asset based on actual historical results and expectations about future economic circumstances including oil and natural gas prices and operating costs 
the estimate of future net cash flows from use of the asset could change if actual prices and costs differ due to industry conditions or other factors affecting the company s performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about key s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange risk  interest rates and oil and natural gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how key views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate risk at june  key had long term debt outstanding of  of this amount   or  bears interest at fixed rates as follows balance at june  thousands senior notes due  senior subordinated notes due  convertible subordinated notes due  other at approximately the remaining  debt outstanding as of june  bears interest at floating rates which averaged approximately at june  a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at june  would equal approximately basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase key s fiscal interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
foreign currency risk during fiscal  the argentine government suspended the law tying the argentine peso to the us dollar at the conversion ratio of and created a dual currency system in argentina 
key s net assets of its argentina subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in argentine pesos as of december  assets and liabilities of the argentine operations were translated to us dollars at june  using the applicable free market conversion ratio of and will be translated at future dates using the applicable free market conversion ratio on such dates 
key s net earnings and cash flows from its argentina subsidiaries were tied to the us dollar for the six months ended december  and are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in argentine pesos for periods after december  revenues  expenses and cash flow will be translated using the average exchange rates during the periods after december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the change in the argentine peso to the us dollar exchange rate since december  has reduced stockholders equity by  through a charge to other comprehensive loss through june  key s net assets  net earnings and cash flows from its canadian subsidiary are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of the canadian operations are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
a change in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate would not be material to the net assets  net earnings or cash flows of the company 
commodity price risk key s major market risk exposure for its oil and natural gas production operations is in the pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas sales 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices for natural gas 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
the company periodically hedges a portion of its oil and natural gas production through collar and option agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability in the volatile environment of oil and natural gas prices and to manage exposure to commodity price risk under existing sales commitments 
the company s risk management objective is to lock in a range of pricing for expected production volumes 
this allows the company to forecast future earnings within a predictable range 
the company meets this objective by entering into collar and option arrangements which allow for acceptable cap and floor prices 
as of june   key had oil and natural gas price collars and put options in place  as detailed in the following table 
the total fiscal hedged oil and natural gas volumes represent approximately and  respectively  of expected calendar year total production 
a variation in the market price of oil or natural gas from their levels at june  would have no material impact on the company s net assets  net earnings or cash flows as derived from commodity option contracts 
the following table sets forth the future volumes hedged by year and the weighted average strike price of the option contracts at june  and monthly income strike price per bbl mmbtu oil gas bbls mmbtu term floor cap fair value at june  oil put  mar feb  oil put  mar feb  gas put  mar feb  at june  oil collar  mar feb  oil put  mar feb  gas collar  mar feb  gas put  mar feb  the strike prices for the oil collars and puts are based on the nymex spot price for west texas intermediate  the strike prices for the natural gas collars are based on the inside ferc west texas waha spot price  the strike price for the natural gas put is based on the inside ferc el paso permian spot price
