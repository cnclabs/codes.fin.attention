the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by or underlying the forward looking statements 
some of the important factors that could cause our actual results  performance or financial condition to differ materially from our expectations are fluctuations in our costs to maintain and update our fleet and facilities  changes in government regulations  particularly environmental regulations  our credit ratings  changes in demand for our products  changes in the general domestic economy  degree and nature of our competition  changes in accounting standards and other factors described in this report or the other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission 
the above factors  the following disclosures  as well as other statements in this report and in the notes to amerco s consolidated financial statements  could contribute to or cause such differences  or could cause amerco s stock price to fluctuate dramatically 
general information on fiscal year  industry segments and amerco and sac holdings is incorporated by reference to item financial statements and supplementary data notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the notes discuss the principles of consolidation  summarized consolidated financial information and industry segment and geographic area data 
in consolidation  all intersegment premiums are eliminated and the benefits  losses and expenses are retained by the insurance companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  estimates are revalued  including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these areas include allowances for doubtful accounts  revenue earning vehicles and buildings  self insured liabilities  income taxes and commitments and contingencies 
the estimates are based on historical experience  observance of trends in particular areas  information and or valuations available from outside sources and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting policies are considered critical when they are significant and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
of the accounting policies discussed in item financial statements and supplementary data note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following are considered to be critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amerco and its wholly owned subsidiaries and sac holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
amerco has not had any equity ownership interest in sac holdings or any of sac holdings subsidiaries 
revenue earning vehicles and buildings depreciation is recognized in amounts expected to result in the recovery of estimated residual values upon disposal ie no gains or losses 
in determining the depreciation rate  historical disposal experience and holding periods  and trends in the market for vehicles are reviewed 
due to longer holding periods on trucks and the resulting increased possibility of changes in the economic environment and market conditions  these estimates are subject to a greater degree of risk 
long lived assets and intangible assets the carrying value is reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable through projected undiscounted future cash flows 
the events could include significant underperformance relative to expected  historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of using the assets  overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends and an unexpected non compliance with significant debt agreements 
investments in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary  quoted market prices  dealer quotes or discounted cash flows are reviewed 
permanent declines in value are recognized in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
insurance revenue and expense recognition premiums are recognized as revenue when due 
benefits and expenses are matched with recognized premiums to result in recognition over the life of the contracts 
this match is accomplished by recording a provision for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and by amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs 
charges related to services to be performed are deferred until earned 
the amounts received in excess of premiums and fees are included in other policyholder funds in the consolidated balance sheets 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which relates to the unexpired term of policies 
liabilities for health and disability and other policy claims and benefits payable represent estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for reported losses and estimates of losses incurred but not yet reported 
these estimates are based on past claims experience and current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions such as changes in legal theories and inflation 
due to the nature of underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims  the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability 
acquisition costs related to insurance contracts have been deferred to accomplish matching against future premium revenue 
the costs are charged to current earnings to the extent it is determined that future premiums are not adequate to cover amounts deferred 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than after year years years years amerco s notes and loans      payable sac holdings notes and loans payable including lease financings      leases obligations      total contractual obligations      liquidity and capital resources amerco s moving and storage operations to meet the needs of its customers  u haul must maintain a large inventory of fixed asset rental items 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures were million  as compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
these expenditures primarily reflect the renewal of the rental truck fleet 
the capital required to fund these acquisitions was obtained through internally generated funds from operations and lease financings 
during each of the fiscal years ending march   and  u haul estimates gross capital expenditures will average approximately million primarily reflecting rental fleet rotation 
this level of capital expenditures  combined with a potential range of million in annual long term debt maturities  are expected to create annual average funding needs of approximately million 
management estimates that u haul will fund these requirements with leases  internally generated funds  including the proceeds from the disposition of older trucks and other asset sales  and to a lesser extent refinance of a portion of existing indebtedness 
the sale of assets is dependent upon economic conditions  the amount and nature of sale leaseback transactions  and amerco s fleet rotation program 
operating leases on rental equipment were the result of sale lease back transactions  whereby as part of the agreement residual value guarantees were provided 
amerco believes the market value of the trucks upon the lease maturity will be greater than the residual value guarantees 
in many cases  a decline in asset sales is accompanied by a decrease in capital expenditures 
depending on the results of our operations and general economic and competitive conditions  many of which we cannot control  we may take certain actions  including delaying or reducing capital expenditures 
real estate has sold storage properties  from time to time  to sac holdings 
these sales have in the past provided significant cash flows to amerco 
the ability of real estate to engage in similar transactions in the future is dependent to a large degree on the ability of sac holdings to obtain third party financing for its acquisitions of properties from real estate and in general  its willingness to engage in such transactions 
also  real estate continues to sell surplus properties to third parties primarily for cash at current levels 
at march   total outstanding notes and mortgages payable for amerco and consolidated subsidiaries was  million compared to  million at march  on june   amerco entered into an agreement replacing an existing revolver agreement with a year revolver for million

the presentation of the consolidated statements has no bearing or consideration to the credit agreements or the operations of each company 
the accounts of amerco and sac holdings are presented as consolidated due to a revised interpretation of eitf by the company s independent public accountants 
the company agrees with the revised interpretations 
credit agreements amerco s operations are funded by various credit and financing arrangements  including unsecured long term borrowings  unsecured medium term notes and revolving lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks 
to finance its fleet of trucks and trailers  u haul routinely enters into sale and leaseback transactions 
as of march   amerco had  million in total notes and loans outstanding 
we believe there are enough leasing companies  banks and other forms of financing to meet our needs 
certain of amerco s credit agreements contain restrictive financial and other covenants  including  among others  covenants with respect to incurring additional indebtedness  making third party guarantees  entering into contingent obligations  maintaining certain financial ratios and placing certain additional liens on its properties and assets and restricting the issuance of certain types of preferred stock 
at march   amerco was in compliance with these covenants 
amerco s various credit and financing arrangements are affected by its credit ratings such that if amerco experiences a credit downgrade  the interest rates that it is charged might be increased  which would result in an increase in amerco s interest expense and hinder its ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to it  if at all 
subsequent to year end  the company executed a million revolver credit agreement and an existing agreement expired
