item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a better understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  including those discussed under business risk factors  that could cause our actual results  performance  financial condition  liquidity  prospects and opportunities in fiscal and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we were formed through a series of acquisitions beginning with the initial acquisitions of detroit tool group  inc and the peer division of teledyne  inc 
in subsequent to those transactions  we acquired a number of companies with proprietary products and manufacturing capabilities that had strong market and technological positions in the niche markets they served and furthered our goal of providing customers with a full range of integrated automated systems 
these acquisitions expanded our base of customers and markets  creating greater opportunities for cross selling among our various divisions 
we primarily operated in two business segments through fiscal automation and packaging 
our automation segment designed and built integrated systems for the assembly  test and handling of discrete products 
our packaging segment manufactured tablet processing  counting and liquid filling systems and plastics processing equipment  including thermoforming  blister packaging and heat sealing 
in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we sold the assets comprising our non core businesses that produced precision stamped steel and aluminum components through our stamping and fabrication operations 
at the end of fiscal year  we discovered certain accounting errors at our kalish  inc and sencorp systems  inc 
subsidiaries 
as a result of these errors  we were required to restate our previously reported audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years  and  as well as the previously reported unaudited consolidated financial information for the first three quarters of fiscal year in response to the accounting errors detected at kalish and sencorp  we appointed a new executive management team in our new management team has been aggressively reviewing our business practices and procedures and implementing needed changes to position us for stability and profitability 
we made significant progress in fiscal to return to financial health by engaging in asset sales to generate cash for debt reduction  modifying our operations in an effort to improve productivity and margins and  as part of a major financial recapitalization transaction described under liquidity and capital resources recapitalization  negotiating an extension of our senior credit facility from july  to july  furthermore  we began implementing the final steps of our corporate restructuring plan to contain costs and improve profitability by reducing our operations from autonomous divisions with manufacturing facilities as of january  to six operating divisions with manufacturing facilities 
this restructuring has included management changes at under performing divisions  reductions in work force throughout our organization  the closing of facilities in montreal  quebec  rochester  new york and bristol  pennsylvania  and the consolidation of our swiftpack and ce king operations 
also as part of this restructuring plan  we are reorganizing our operations into four business segments material processing  precision assembly  assembly and test and packaging systems 
this new structure is designed to allow us to streamline product offerings  capitalize on the combined strength of operating units  reduce overlap in the marketplace and improve capacity utilization  internal controls  financial reporting and disclosure controls 
we are still implementing this integration plan and completing the systems required to provide  analyze  review and report results of operations for current and historical periods for our newly defined segments 
we intend to begin reporting financial results for these four new business segments in our form q for the fiscal quarter ended september  almost all of our net sales are derived from the sale and installation of equipment and systems primarily under fixed price contracts 
we also derive net sales from the sale of spare and replacement parts and servicing installed equipment and systems 
we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method or upon delivery and acceptance in accordance with sab we principally utilize the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize revenues and related costs for the sale and installation of equipment and systems pursuant to customer contracts 
these contracts are typically engineering driven design and build contracts of automated production equipment and systems used to manufacture  test or package a variety of industrial and consumer products 
these contracts are generally for large dollar amounts and require a significant amount of labor hours with durations ranging from three months to over a year 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues and related costs are measured based on the ratio of engineering and manufacturing hours incurred to date compared to total estimated engineering and manufacturing labor hours 
any revisions in the estimated total costs of the contracts during the course of the work are reflected when the facts that require the revisions become known 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is described below under critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition percentage of completion method 
for those contracts accounted for in accordance with sab  we recognize revenue upon shipment fob shipping point 
we utilize this method of revenue recognition for products produced in a standard manufacturing operation whereby the product is built according to pre existing bills of materials  with some customisation occurring 
these contracts are typically of shorter duration one to three months and have smaller contract values 
the revenue recognition for these products follows the terms of the contracts  which calls for transfer of title at time of shipment after factory acceptance tests with the customer 
if installation of the products is included in the contracts  revenue for the installation portion of the contract is recognized when installation is complete 
costs and related expenses to manufacture products  primarily labor  materials and overhead  are recorded as cost of sales when the related revenue is recognized 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary and wages for employees  research and development costs  sales commissions and marketing and professional expenses 
prior to fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses also included goodwill amortization 
recent restatement of historical financial results as publicly announced on august  prior to the public announcement of our consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ended june   we discovered that we were required to make accounting adjustments to our previously reported audited consolidated financial results for the fiscal years ended june   june  and june   as well as our previously reported unaudited consolidated financial results for the first three fiscal quarters of  due to an overstatement of the balance sheet account entitled costs and estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts cie 
the cie balance is comprised of estimated gross margins recognized to date plus actual work in process costs incurred to date less billings deposits to date 
the overstatement of cie occurred at our assembly machines  inc ami subsidiary  a small facility located in erie  pennsylvania that has historically been part of our automation segment 
this cie overstatement resulted in a corresponding understatement of cost of sales because cie represents project costs that have been expended  but are still available to be billed  therefore  the overstatement in cie included available to bill amounts that should have been expensed to cost of sales in prior periods 
the cumulative amount of the accounting adjustments increased the aggregate pre tax loss reported during the impacted periods by million and increased the aggregate net loss after taxes reported during the impacted periods by million 
our restated audited consolidated financial statements as of  and for the fiscal year ended  june  and our restated audited consolidated statement of operations  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year ended june  are included on pages f through f and note to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
restated selected consolidated financial data for those two fiscal years  as well as the fiscal year ended june   is included under item selected financial data 
restated unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended june  and june  is included in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
we discovered the accounting adjustments while beginning the transfer of the sales and accounting functions at ami to our dt precision assembly segment headquarters in buffalo grove  illinois in connection with the reorganization of our operations described in business markets and products 
our board of directors authorized the audit and finance committee to conduct an independent investigation  with the assistance of special counsel retained by the committee  to identify the causes of these accounting adjustments 
the committee retained katten muchin zavis rosenman kmzr as special counsel  and kmzr engaged an independent accounting firm to assist in the investigation 
in addition  we investigated whether similar issues existed at any of our other subsidiaries 
as a result of the investigations  we believe that the accounting issues were confined to ami and determined that the misstatement of the cie account at ami was primarily the result of the former controller of ami  without instruction from  or the knowledge of  our management  failing to properly account for manufacturing variances  adding inappropriate costs to work in process amounts  understating amounts billed and or customer deposits and failing to recognize certain losses  in each case on various projects during the relevant time period 
using these miscalculations of cie  the former ami controller made incorrect journal entries that were recorded in the books and records of ami 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has prepared the consolidated financial statements included herein in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes to be reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes involve estimates  judgments and assumptions that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from estimates  judgments and assumptions we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition percentage of completion method we recognize a significant portion of our revenues and profits as contracts progress using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
under this method  estimated contract revenues and resulting gross profit are recognized based on labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor hours to complete the contract 
we follow this method because we believe reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract profitability  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and purchased equipment 
additionally  external factors  such as customer needs and customer delays in providing approvals  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of profit and revenue recognition 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenues and profit recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenues and profits 
when current estimates of total contract costs indicate that the contract will result in a loss  the projected loss is recognized in full in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
many of our contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the customer 
in the event a contract is terminated at the convenience of the customer prior to completion  we will typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs 
in addition  many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control 
losses on terminated contracts and liquidated damages have historically not been significant 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
with regards to stock inventories  we regularly count quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates 
with regards to finished goods inventories  we record market value reserves based on estimated forecasts of future product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  estimates of future product demand involve inherent uncertainties  which may result in additional charges related to excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on our level of inventory reserves and reported operating results 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of new and existing customers and constantly monitor customer payments via accounts receivable aging reports 
we maintain an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based upon historical experience and known customer collection issues 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reevaluated at each balance sheet date and adjusted based on information that impacts the estimates of uncollectible amounts 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
goodwill impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we assess recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors that we would consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of a segment or division relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes in the strategy for a segment or division 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we derive a fair value for our reporting units  which represent the various components of our operating segments  and compare such fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if there is any indication of goodwill impairment 
for purposes of deriving the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business models  changes in our weighted average cost of capital  or changes in our operating performance 
we will recognize an impairment charge to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill balances for the reporting units is less than the carrying value of such goodwill balances 
given that this impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level for which discrete financial information is available  it is possible for a segment of our business  which represents an aggregation of reporting units  to show increased levels of sales and operating results but at the same time have impairment within such segment 
warranty accruals we routinely incur costs after projects are installed and closed 
we record these costs as warranty charges within cost of sales 
warranty costs are estimated at the time a project is closed based on our historical warranty experience and consideration of any known warranty issues 
the fluctuation in our warranty costs depends on the nature and timing of our projects 
increases in warranty costs coincide with our incurring increased costs associated with projects that have performance issues 
our estimate of warranty expense may differ from actual warranty expense incurred due to  among other things  our inability to satisfactorily debug all customer projects or our inability to meet all specifications of customer projects

automation segment net sales decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from fiscal the decrease in net sales was a result of the softness in order activity across all markets served by this segment over the last months  as well as a million decrease in net sales as a result of the sale of our vanguard division in march within the automation segment  automotive related sales decreased by million  or  from fiscal this decrease in automotive related sales was due to net sales related to a large capital spending program of a customer in the automotive tire market being recognized during fiscal and to the general softness in the economy that has restrained customer capital spending in the automotive market 
within the automation segment  sales to the electronics market decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease in electronics related sales was due to net sales related to several large capital spending programs of a customer in the electronics market being recognized in fiscal the remainder of the decrease in net sales for the automation segment was primarily attributable to lower sales recognized in the heavy truck and other consumer markets  also due to the softness in the economy 
packaging segment net sales decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from fiscal the decrease in net sales related primarily to lower sales of packaging equipment to the pharmaceutical and nutritional markets and lower sales of thermoforming equipment to the plastics packaging market attributable to reduced capital spending in these markets as a result of the economic downturn they have experienced 
this amount also includes a million decrease in net sales as a result of the sale of the assets of our scheu kniss division in july sales from our other businesses decreased million as a result of the sale of substantially all the assets of detroit tool metal products in june and hansford parts and products in october gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended june  from million for the twelve months ended june  gross profit in fiscal reflected million of charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily related to provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  other inventory market value write downs and certain fixed asset write downs 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of these charges 
gross profit in fiscal reflected decreased warranty expense of million from fiscal due to greater amounts of warranty activity during fiscal related to specific problematic projects 
our gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in our gross profits reflects the effect of the million decrease in net sales 
the increase in our gross margin reflects improved margins in both our automation and packaging segments 
the gross margins in our automation segment improved to in fiscal versus in fiscal as a result of improved project performance in the electronics market gained from manufacturing efficiencies in the production of duplicate systems 
our packaging segment margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of our fiscal restructuring  which reduced headcount and overhead costs 
packaging segment margins in fiscal reflect million of the million of charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million from the million for the fiscal year ended june  the million decrease in sg a expenses was primarily a result of the following items million decrease resulting from the million charge in fiscal for asset write downs primarily related to doubtful accounts of which we recovered million in fiscal  million decrease in amortization as a result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in fiscal due to our implementation of sfas as of june   which replaces the requirement to amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives with a requirement for an annual impairment test  million decrease in sg a expenses resulting from the sale of vanguard technical solutions in the third quarter of fiscal  scheu kniss and detroit tool metal products in the first quarter of fiscal and hansford parts and products in the second quarter of fiscal  million decrease in sg a expenses in fiscal resulting from savings in salary and compensation expenses as a result of a decrease in headcount from our fiscal restructuring  million in non recurring legal  consulting and other professional expenses and severance related expenses incurred in fiscal in connection with the investigations into our accounting restatement in fiscal  million decrease in sg a expenses in fiscal relating to our rochester  new york and montreal  quebec manufacturing facilities  and million reversal of post retirement benefit accruals due to cancellation of post retirement plans in fiscal we expect sg a expenses to continue to decrease in fiscal due to the actions we took in fiscal in connection with our corporate restructuring described below 
we expect this decrease  however  to be partially offset by an increase in research and development costs and increased legal and other professional expenses in connection with the investigations into the accounting adjustments at ami and compliance with new corporate governance rules 
during fiscal  we announced several actions in connection with our corporate restructuring plan as outlined below 
these actions resulted in an aggregate of million of restructuring charges in fiscal closure of our rochester  new york facility  including termination of employees  in the fourth quarter of and the transfer of the customer base of this facility primarily to our dayton  ohio and buffalo grove  illinois facilities 
the closure was announced january  the restructuring costs  which totaled million  were recorded in the third quarter of fiscal and included estimated severance costs of million for the termination of up to employees 
as of june   four employees remained for final administrative duties  all of whom were discharged by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the remaining restructuring costs include million for future facility lease and related costs  million for asset write offs and million for office equipment lease terminations and miscellaneous other charges 
the asset write offs include the remaining value of leasehold improvements  the computer system and show machines 
closure of our montreal  quebec facility  including termination of employees in august  and the transfer of its customer base and assets to our operations in leominster  massachusetts 
the closure of this facility was announced march  the restructuring costs of million were recorded in the third quarter of fiscal and included estimated severance costs of million for the termination of approximately employees  partially offset by a reversal of million associated with severance accrual recorded in fiscal employees remained at june   of which were terminated by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the remaining restructuring costs include million for future facility lease and related costs  million for asset write offs and million of other costs 
the asset write offs primarily include the remaining value of leasehold improvements and the computer system 
transfer of our manufacturing operation in bristol  pennsylvania to hyannis  massachusetts as part of our converting technologies division 
the closure of this operation was announced march  and completed in september the restructuring costs of million were recorded in the third quarter of fiscal and included severance costs of million for the termination of employees 
up to employees are expected to remain in bristol for sales and engineering support 
as of june   there had been no terminations 
by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  employees were terminated 
the remaining restructuring costs include million of asset write offs  million for future facility lease and related costs and 
million of other costs 
the asset write offs include the remaining value of leasehold improvements 
transfer of our assembly and test europe fabrication operation from gawcott  united kingdom to our buckingham  england plant in the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring costs of million were recorded in the third quarter of fiscal and included estimated severance costs of million for the termination of employees  all of whom were terminated by june  the restructuring costs include million for future lease payments and 
of other costs 
we recognized additional restructuring charges of million in fiscal primarily related to severance costs associated with management changes and workforce reductions at several divisions  as well as future lease payments resulting from the consolidation of two packaging segment divisions 
the restructuring charge included estimated severance costs of million for the termination of employees  million for future lease payments and million of asset write offs 
all of the employees were terminated by june  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement for our hyannis  massachusetts facility and recorded a net loss on disposal of assets of million in connection with that transaction 
we entered into the sale leaseback transaction in order to retire the million of variable rate industrial revenue bonds  which were backed by a letter of credit drawn on fleet national bank fleet  that we issued in to fund the expansion of this facility 
fleet  under the terms of the letter of credit reimbursement agreement  required us to post cash collateral to support the letter of credit no later than august  the proceeds of the sale leaseback transaction were used to repay the industrial revenue bonds on august   thereby eliminating the need to post the cash collateral 
we also avoided a fee charged by fleet for the letter of credit and maintained the liquidity under our senior credit revolving line 
see liquidity and capital resources industrial revenue bonds 
the effect of the sale leaseback was the removal of the facility  which had a carrying value of million at june  from our accounting records and the recording of cash proceeds of approximately million 
we will have lease expense  on a go forward basis  of approximately million annually 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june  the decrease resulted from lower outstanding borrowings as a result of the application of asset sale proceeds and additional debt paydowns 
dividends on our trust preferred securities were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to the financial recapitalization discussed in liquidity and capital resources recapitalization  which effectively eliminated the accrued dividend in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect interest on our senior debt and dividends on our trust preferred securities to be approximately million in fiscal as a result of the financial recapitalization 
the income tax benefit was million  or an effective tax benefit rate of  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to an income tax benefit of million  or an effective tax benefit rate of  for the fiscal year ended june  the effective income tax benefit rate primarily reflects valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards 
we recorded a gain on conversion of trust preferred securities of million  net of tax of million  in june the gain resulted from the financial recapitalization pursuant to which the holders of our trust preferred securities exchanged million of outstanding trust preferred securities and million in accrued and unpaid distributions for  shares of our common stock 
the shares were valued for book and tax purposes based on the market price of our common stock on the closing date of the financial recapitalization 
fiscal restated compared to fiscal restated our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the fiscal year ended june  automation segment net sales increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales was primarily the result of several large capital spending programs of a customer in our electronics market 
we manufactured these electronics assembly systems across several of our automation divisions 
sales to our electronics market accounted for approximately of total automation segment sales in fiscal packaging segment net sales decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from the prior fiscal year 
plastics related equipment sales were down approximately million from a combination of the decision to exit the extrusion business and significantly lower sales of thermoforming equipment 
extrusion equipment sales were approximately million in fiscal sales of thermoforming systems decreased as a result of a market downturn in plastics related products and machinery 
sales from our other packaging businesses also decreased substantially in fiscal versus fiscal the decrease in sales was across several product lines  including presses  counters  fillers and line integration  primarily to the pharmaceutical and nutritional markets 
net sales from our other businesses  primarily detroit tool metal products  remained constant at million in fiscal in comparison to fiscal we sold detroit tool metal products in june and sold our remaining components business in october gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease reflects lower gross margins across all business segments for the fiscal year 
gross profit in fiscal reflects million of charges taken in the fourth quarter primarily related to provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  other inventory market value write downs and certain fixed asset writedowns 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of these charges 
gross profit in fiscal reflected increased warranty expense of approximately million from fiscal due to greater amounts of warranty activity during related to specific problematic projects 
the automation segment s margins decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from in the prior fiscal year 
the lower margins primarily resulted from several large projects initiated in fiscal the lower margins on these projects were attributable to pricing and to the ramp up costs and initial inefficiencies associated with the first few of multiple electronics systems being engineered and manufactured for an electronics customer 
we incurred substantial costs associated with the use of contract labor in ramping up to meet the delivery needs of customers in fiscal the margins during fiscal reflected the capitalization of million of certain engineering costs on the first of these multiple systems being manufactured 
the first system was shipped in the second quarter of we amortized approximately million in fiscal with the remaining amount fully amortized by the end of january the packaging segment s margins decreased to for the twelve months ended june  from in the prior fiscal year 
the gross margins reflect million of charges taken by the packaging segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily related to provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and other inventory market value write downs 
the lower gross margins were also a reflection of the decrease in sales and the resulting increase in unfavorable manufacturing absorption 
we significantly restructured both our sencorp and kalish operations in fiscal  reducing headcount and overhead costs 
headcount at sencorp and kalish was reduced approximately and  respectively 
sg a expenses were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million from the million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase reflected million in charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily related to increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts and fixed asset write offs 
we also incurred approximately million in non recurring legal  consulting and other professional expenses and severance related expenses during fiscal in connection with the investigations into our accounting restatements in fiscal excluding the million in unusual expenses  sg a expenses in fiscal were approximately less than the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to several businesses in both our automation and packaging segments 
the write down of goodwill was primarily a result of a continued decline in the operating results of certain subsidiaries and management assumptions regarding future performance based on the overall economic recession and an evaluation of our organizational and operational structure 
we calculated the present value of expected cash flows to determine the fair value of the subsidiaries using a discount rate of  which represented the weighted average cost of capital 
included in the goodwill write down was a full impairment charge of million related to our stokes division 
this charge was based on a sales price outlined in a letter of intent to sell this subsidiary  which established fair value of the division based on a current transaction 
the net loss on the disposal of scheu kniss recorded in fiscal included a full impairment of the related goodwill of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for severance costs associated with management changes and workforce reductions  future lease costs on idle facilities and personnel relocation costs resulting from the relocation of our corporate office and the closure of four packaging segment sales offices and non cash asset write downs 
in particular  our fiscal restructuring plan consisted of the following actions closure of our canadian operation s sales offices  including the termination of employees 
these offices were closed in the fourth quarter of in addition  there was a headcount reduction at the montreal  quebec location 
these people were notified of termination in the fourth quarter of fiscal total severance costs were million and future lease costs on rented office space for the sales offices was million 
as mandated by canadian law  a six month waiting period is required before termination after notice is given 
after notification  during the six month period  a number of employees left voluntarily and therefore received no benefits 
accordingly  an amount of million was reversed to income in fiscal consolidation of two of our united kingdom operations  which included the termination of employees in the first quarter of fiscal at a cost of million 
relocation of our corporate offices from springfield  missouri to dayton  ohio 
total moving costs incurred were million in the fourth quarter of  which included personnel relocation costs of million and other moving costs of million 
these moving costs were recognized when incurred 
in addition  we accrued future lease costs on the idle office space in springfield of million 
lastly  severance of million was recorded for termination of employees at our springfield office 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our corporate airplane and substantially all of the net assets of vanguard technical solutions 
net proceeds from the sales of these assets were approximately million  resulting in a pre tax loss of million 
subsequent to june   we sold substantially all of the net assets of detroit tool metal products and scheu kniss 
net proceeds for the sales of these assets were approximately million  resulting in a pre tax loss of approximately million that was recorded in fiscal interest expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the substantial increase pertains to both the increase in our interest rate on borrowings pursuant to the senior secured credit facility and the increase in average borrowings outstanding 
borrowings increased to fund working capital requirements 
dividends on the convertible preferred trust securities were million and million for the years ended june  and june   respectively 
as of june   the dividends were being deferred and accrued in conjunction with the september amendment to the senior credit facility 
the income tax benefit was million  or an effective tax benefit rate of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to an income tax benefit of million  or an effective tax benefit rate of  for the fiscal year ended june  the effective income tax benefit rate reflects permanent differences  primarily non deductible goodwill amortization related to certain acquisitions 
a substantial part of the goodwill impairment charges in fiscal were non deductible 
we also recorded a million deferred tax assets valuation allowance in fiscal primarily related to canadian net tax loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity net cash flow generated by operations was million in fiscal  compared with net cash used by operating activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flow in fiscal was primarily attributable to a reduction in working capital of million 
the primary cause of the net cash used by operations in fiscal and fiscal was to fund increases in working capital 
the decrease in working capital of million in fiscal from fiscal can be primarily attributed to the reduction in net sales of million  or  from fiscal note to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein provides a breakdown of the components of costs and estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts cie and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings that contributed to the decrease in working capital 
as shown in note  costs incurred on uncompleted contracts decreased million from june  to june  reflecting our much lower level of project activity at june  also contributing to the decrease of working capital are working capital management programs that we put into place during fiscal to ensure that project cash flow could be financed with our capital resources 
the reductions in the various components of working capital were a result of better management of payment terms with customers and suppliers  a shift of project mix towards projects with better payment terms and a focus on reduction of inventories carried 
the net decrease in working capital in fiscal from fiscal was million 
the decrease in working capital was a result of reductions in accounts receivable and inventories offset by a substantial increase in cie within our automation segment relating to a very large diesel engine assembly system project 
the reductions in accounts receivable and inventories were primarily due to the non cash charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million to accounts receivable and million to inventories 
our working capital balances can fluctuate significantly between periods as a result of the significant costs incurred on individual contracts  the relatively large amounts invoiced and collected for a number of large contracts  and the amounts and timing of customer advances or progress payments associated with certain contracts 
cash flow provided by investing activities in fiscal generated million 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million  offset by proceeds of million from the disposal of detroit tool metal products  scheu kniss and hansford parts and products  the sale leaseback of our hyannis  massachusetts manufacturing facility for million and the sale of miscellaneous pieces of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was for capital expenditures of million offset partially by million from the sale of our corporate airplane and the sale of substantially all of the assets of vanguard technical solutions 
net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal was for capital expenditures of million  the acquisition of the net assets of c 
e 
king in july for million and the acquisition of intellectual property for approximately million 
these expenditures were financed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal to be between and million 
during fiscal  we repaid million in borrowings from the cash generated from operations  assets sales and the private placement discussed below 
we believe that cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service needs up to july   the maturity date of our senior credit facility 
we will need to refinance or extend our senior credit facility in order to satisfy our liquidity needs after july  senior credit facility and trust preferred securities we use our borrowings under our senior credit facility to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and finance charges 
borrowings under our senior credit facility are secured by substantially all of our domestic assets 
as of june   our senior credit facility consisted of a million revolving credit facility and a million term credit facility 
of this amount  million was outstanding including million in outstanding letters of credit and total borrowing availability was million 
see business risk factors the covenants and restrictions under our senior credit facility could limit our operating and financial flexibility for a discussion of restrictive covenants contained in the credit facility 
at june   interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility ranged from to 
through december   borrowings were based on prime rate plus for domestic borrowings or the eurodollar rate plus on foreign currency borrowings 
after december  and through june   the prime rate increment increased to and the eurodollar rate increment increased to 
subsequent to june   pursuant to the amended credit facility  the interest rates are as stated below under recapitalization bank amendment 
the amended facility requires commitment fees of per annum payable quarterly on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility  an annual agency fee of  a amendment fee paid june   and a annual facility fee 
the annual facility fee will be forgiven if the debt is paid in full and the credit facility is cancelled before the annual due dates 
as a result of our financial performance in fiscal  we were in default of certain financial covenants  including the minimum trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non recurring items ebitda and maximum funded debt to ebitda financial covenants under the facility 
as of june   we entered into an amendment to the senior credit facility that  among other things  included a permanent waiver of these defaults and extended the facility s maturity date to july  see recapitalization bank amendment below 
we also exceeded our capital expenditure limitation under the facility for the fourth quarter of fiscal we obtained a waiver from our lenders for our failure to comply with this provision 
on june   we completed a private placement to several institutional investors of million of convertible preferred securities tides 
the tides offering was made by our wholly owned subsidiary trust  dt capital trust the trust 
the tides represent undivided beneficial ownership interests in the trust  the sole assets of which are the related aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by us that the trust acquired with the proceeds of the tides offering 
as originally structured  the tides were convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
furthermore  the tides holders were entitled to receive cash distributions at an annual rate of  payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter 
in connection with the september amendment to our senior credit facility  we elected to defer distributions on the tides for up to five years 
as of march   the date through which quarterly distributions on the tides were deferred  we had deferred million of quarterly distributions on the tides 
in connection with our financial recapitalization transaction that we completed on june  we restructured our agreement with the tides holders and  among other things  exchanged half of the outstanding tides  plus the deferred quarterly distributions on the tides  for  shares of our common stock 
see recapitalization tides exchange below 
therefore  there was million of tides issued and outstanding as of june  we have guaranteed the payment of distributions and payments on liquidation of the trust or the redemption of the tides 
through this guarantee  our junior subordinated debentures  the debentures indenture and the trust s declaration of trust  taken together  we have fully  irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed all of the trust s obligations under the tides 
thus  while the tides are not included in our liabilities for financial reporting purposes and instead appear on our consolidated balance sheet between liabilities and stockholders equity  they represent obligations of dti 
recapitalization on june   we consummated a major financial recapitalization transaction comprised of an amendment to our senior credit facility the bank amendment  a restructuring of our tides securities the tides exchange and the sale of million shares of our common stock for per share in a private placement the private placement 
each component of our financial recapitalization is described below

the bank amendment requires us to make pro rata reductions of the revolving loan commitment and term loan of million per quarter commencing on september   as a result of excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility agreement for the fiscal year ending june   and as a result of proceeds from equity issuances other than in connection with employee stock option exercises 
the bank amendment also reset the financial covenants under the senior credit facility  including maintenance of minimum levels of ebitda and quarterly net worth and maximum annual capital expenditures 
tides exchange as part of our financial recapitalization  we consummated the tides exchange  whereby the tides holders exchanged million of outstanding tides and million of accrued and unpaid distributions thereon into  shares of common stock at a price of per share  the maturity date of the remaining million of tides was shortened from may  to may   the conversion price of the remaining tides was reduced from per share to per share  the tides holders agreed to a distribution holiday pursuant to which distributions on the remaining tides will not accrue from april  through july   and provided that we make the first distribution payment following the distribution holiday  we will have the right from time to time to defer distributions on the tides through their maturity in we have filed a registration statement on form s with the commission to register the resale of the shares of common stock issued upon the exchange  and issuable upon the future conversion  of the trust preferred securities 
we also granted the holders of the trust preferred securities as a group the right to appoint one representative to attend and observe meetings of our board of directors 
this right will expire upon the conversion of all of the remaining trust preferred securities into shares of common stock 
the holders of the trust preferred securities have agreed to not sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of our common stock for a period of days following june  private placement as part of the financial recapitalization  we consummated the private placement to several stockholders of million shares of our common stock at per share 
we used the proceeds of the offering to repay indebtedness of approximately million under the senior credit facility and to pay transaction expenses of approximately million 
the registration statement on form s that we have filed with the commission will also register the resale of these shares of common stock 
pursuant to the share purchase agreement for the private placement  we amended our amended and restated by laws and our stock incentive plans to provide that  unless approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock  we will not grant stock options that have an exercise price less than the underlying stock s fair market value on the grant date  reprice any outstanding stock options  including through the cancellation of outstanding options and grant of replacement options with a lower exercise price or accelerated vesting schedule or restricted stock  sell or issue any security convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  shares of common stock having a conversion  exercise or exchange price per share that is subject to downward adjustment based on the market price of the common stock at the time of conversion  exercise or exchange  or in general  enter into any equity line or agreement to sell common stock or any security convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  shares of common stock at a purchase  conversion  exercise or exchange price per share that is fixed after the execution date of the agreement 
these restrictions may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the equity or debt markets in the future should we need to do so

backlog our backlog is based upon customer purchase orders we believe are firm 
as of june   we had million of orders in backlog  which compares to a backlog of approximately million as of june  automation segment backlog was million as of june   a decrease of million from the prior year 
the decrease in backlog reflects the high backlog of orders of automation systems at june  for a key customer in the electronics market 
we have not been able to replace this work because the soft economy has adversely affected capital spending in most of our other markets 
the lower backlog also reflects some trends in the industry  including shorter lead times and the placement of smaller customer orders 
backlog for the packaging segment decreased million  or  to million primarily due to softness across several packaging product lines 
the level of backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of our future operating performance for any particular reporting period because we may not be able to recognize as sales the orders in our backlog when expected or at all due to various contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  many purchase orders are subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification 
certain orders are also subject to delays in completion and shipment at the request of the customer 
however  our contracts normally provide for cancellation and or delay charges that require the customer to reimburse us for costs actually incurred and a portion of the quoted profit margin on the project 
we believe most of the orders in our backlog as of june  will be recognized as sales during fiscal foreign operations our primary foreign operations are conducted through subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
our canadian subsidiary was closed in august the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are the currencies native to the specific country in which the subsidiary is located 
foreign operations accounted for approximately million  million and million of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
loss from operations for our foreign operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

this statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
this statement is effective for us in fiscal we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in august  the fasb issued statement of financial account standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions

costs associated with exit or disposal activities in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between this statement and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the board in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   at which date we will adopt such provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
these exposures primarily relate to having investments in assets denominated in foreign currencies and to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact operating results  including net sales and operating expenses 
we mitigate certain of our foreign currency exposure by borrowing in the local functional currency in countries where we have significant assets denominated in foreign currencies 
these borrowings include pounds sterling  canadian dollars and deutsche marks in the united kingdom  canada and germany  respectively 
we may  but currently do not  utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts and swap agreements  to manage certain of our foreign currency and interest rate risks that we consider practical to do so 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
market risks that we currently have elected not to hedge primarily relate to our floating rate debt 
if interest rates increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  and net income would decrease by approximately million 
this amount has been determined using the assumptions that our outstanding floating rate debt  as of june   will continue to be outstanding throughout fiscal and that the average interest rates for these instruments will increase over fiscal the model does not consider the effects of the reduced level of potential overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  we would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure
