the company s principal operating companies are fcj and xtal 
fcj manufactures both multimode and single mode fiber and preforms with an emphasis on the multimode market  xtal manufactures both multimode and single mode fiber and single mode preforms with an emphasis on the single mode market 
the company maintains its corporate headquarters in charlton  massachusetts  which is staffed primarily by executive  accounting and administrative personnel 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations is based on the company s audited financial statements for the years ended december   and critical accounting policies for a detailed discussion of the company s accounting policies  refer to the summary of significant accounting policies on page for a summary of significant accounting policies 
the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues in accordance with invoice terms  typically when products are shipped and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the estimated market value of the inventory 
the company provides estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may be required 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
valuation of long lived assets we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations results of operations year ended december  the results for the twelve month period include the operations of dci  which was acquired on june  and merged into alt as of the date of the acquisition  and the results of xtal  which was acquired june  the results for includes a full year of operations for xtal as compared to seven month s operations in sales for the twelve month period ended december   increased by  or compared to the comparable period in the increase includes twelve month s sales for xtal of  for  compared to sales for the full year of of  only  of which was included in operations of the company since the acquisition date of june  the decrease in sales for xtal as compared to the full year of was attributable to the dramatic decline in the south american fiber market as well as the worldwide market for single mode fiber and deterioration of pricing during the last half of this included the loss of sales to a major customer in the second half of the year who was in breach of contract during that period  after buying fiber at significantly higher levels than during the first half of the year 
sales for xtal decreased in the final seven month period in as compared to the same period in by  or 
the south american customer referenced above has paid all of the accounts receivable owed to the company  approximately  which was part of the breach of contract 
the company is in ongoing discussions with this customer and expects to resume shipping fiber to this customer in the first half of at a significantly lower rate than in early due to the much lower demand levels that currently exist in the south american market 
shipments have not yet resumed to this customer 
xtal and the customer are operating under an existing contract  and the company expects to be the primary supplier of optical fiber to this customer over the next several years 
the company would expect that sales will return to previous levels with this customer when the south american market strengthens to the level of early performance and assuming our customer is able to secure contracts at similar levels to its previous performance 
there can be no assurance as to when and if these two conditions will occur 
notwithstanding that no shipments were made to this customer after july of  total sales to them increased by over  from to if this customer had purchased product at the same volume level in the second half of the year as it did in the first half of the year  revenues would have been higher by about  after adjusting for declining prices during the period 
overall  the softening in the south american market  including the situation with the customer described above  and the associated reduction in pricing brought about by the overall softening in the worldwide single mode fiber market  resulted in a reduction in sales of approximately  from the first half of to the second half of the year 
as a result of the lower demand  the company has been operating its xtal facility at reduced production levels since september the company does not intend to reduce production levels at fcj  the company s german subsidiary 
the company expects volume and pricing to remain at depressed levels for the first and second quarters of and should begin to recover thereafter 
xtal is expected to have improved volume levels beginning in the second quarter of as a result of new business in the asian market as well as new customers in south america 
sales from the company s german subsidiary  fcj increased by  or for the year ended december  the revenue increases were primarily due to higher shipment volume to new and continuing customers 
the majority of fcj s shipments are multi mode fiber and that market was not as adversely affected either in demand or pricing as the single mode market 
company wide  the volume increase in fiber shipments during represented an increase in sales of  while the net effect of pricing changes decreased revenues by  million as compared to however  pricing was higher during the first half of the year and then decreased significantly during the second half of the year 
gross profit was  or of sales in compared to  or of sales in the  increase in gross profit occurred during the first half of the year 
margins declined in the third and fourth quarters as a result of pricing pressures due to the slowdown in the overall fiber market and reached a low of in the fourth quarter 
the sudden and unprecedented change in demand in the market has driven single mode fiber prices down from their levels in the first half of this is expected to continue until industry inventories are trimmed and supply and demand factors become better aligned 
the company expects continued pricing pressure in the near term that will continue to negatively affect gross margins 
the company anticipates that the gross margins will improve later in as both volumes and pricing start to recover from the currently depressed levels in the single mode fiber market 
in addition  we expect margins will improve over time  as a result of higher production levels and continued cost reductions  process improvements and integration of technology between operations 
some variation can be expected from quarter to quarter as i incremental costs are incurred in connection with the installation and start up of new equipment  and ii pricing variation due to scheduled market pricing adjustments made on a quarterly basis in accordance with the terms of new and existing contracts 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased  or compared to sg a costs were of sales in as compared to during the increase in percent of sales was attributable to the reduced sales levels during the second half of  as sg a was during the first half of the inclusion of xtal for the entire year of as compared to seven months in and the acquisition of dci  accounted for  or of the increase 
fcq and fcm accounted for approximately  of the increase as compared to increases in personnel  legal and accounting fees  travel and trade show expenses at all locations accounted for the balance of the increase 
research and development costs increased  or over the company intends to continue to invest in its research and development to increase production efficiency  reduce manufacturing costs and develop new products 
the company believes this investment will result in increased profitability through increased production efficiency 
excluding the effect of non cash interest charges  in the amount of  recorded in with respect to the deemed beneficial conversion attributable to  in notes issued to crescent international  ltd  interest expense would have increased by  the borrowings for were primarily related to expansion of facilities in germany and brazil and general working capital used at all locations 
the company had foreign exchange gains of  compared to a gain of  for the gains were principally due to the impact of the fluctuations in the value of the brazilian real versus the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark on foreign currency denominated invoices and loans for xtal raw material purchases 
the company recorded a tax provision of  for  compared to a provision of  in the provision is primarily a result of taxable income earned at the company s operations in germany and brazil 
the provision reflects no tax benefits attributable to operating losses incurred in the us year ended december  the results for the twelve month period ended december  includes the operations of xtal  from june  net sales for the year ended december  increased by  or  over the increase includes the sales of xtal for the seven months ended december  of  additionally  sales from the company s german subsidiary increased by  or for the year ended december  the revenue increase is primarily due to increases in product shipped to new and continuing customers  as well as increases in product prices 
high product demand  higher pricing and strong sales growth at both facilities continued to strengthen during the year 
cost of sales increased by  or over due to the increase in volume shipped  offset by a decrease in costs per unit of production 
of this amount   relates to xtal 
due to the mix of products sold  it is not practical to disclose costs per unit of production for each of the different products 
average production costs overall declined by approximately from to this decrease in production costs was the result of changes in the mix of products produced  improved production yields lower raw material consumption for the volume produced and production process improvements resulting in a greater volume of production per machine hour 
the company continuously invests in process development to further reduce costs 
gross profit was  or of net sales in compared to  or of net sales in of the  increase  xtal accounted for  fcj accounted for  a increase over the  reported for the prior year 
the rise in gross profit results from the addition of xtal  increases in prices and quantities shipped  and manufacturing process improvements 
selling  general and administrative costs increased by  or  over this increase is almost entirely attributable to expenses incurred by xtal 
selling  general and administrative costs were of net sales in compared to of net sales in  reflecting a higher sales base 
research and development costs were  an increase of  or over the prior year 
of this increase   or relates to xtal 
the company intends to continue its research and development to increase production  reduce manufacturing costs and develop new products 
interest income increased  in compared to primarily due to the increase in income from the investments of the dm  security deposit with the sparkasse jena and interest income from xtal 
non cash interest expense of  which was offset by an increase in paid in capital  relates to the deemed beneficial conversion feature of the  convertible notes issued to crescent international ltd 
in june and july other interest expense was  in compared to  in the decrease was attributable primarily to the repayment and conversion of outstanding loans 
the company recorded a tax provision of  in compared to a net tax benefit of  in the provision for is primarily the result of taxable income earned by the company s foreign operations in brazil and germany 
the provision also reflects no benefit for us operating losses and the  non cash interest expense described above 
in  the company recognized the future tax benefit of the remaining net operating loss carryover from the german subsidiary 
excluding the effect of non cash interest charges of  net income for was  rather than a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the primary cause of the  increase was the increase in sales  the increase in gross margins  the decrease in the percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses to net sales  partially offset by higher research and development expenses and the provision for taxes 
liquidity and capital resources general the downturn in the economy and the telecommunications industry in particular as a result of cutbacks in capital spending  coupled with an overcapacity of installed fiber  affected global demand for single mode fiber primarily in north america  south america and europe starting in july  while projected volumes in asia are still strong  pricing has eroded by more than to record lows for single mode fiber  caused primarily by decreased demand and a number of large producers trying to deplete high levels of inventory 
the company expects pricing to level off in the second quarter of and begin increasing in the second half of or early we also expect to see demand start to increase in this same period in north america and europe with the increase in volumes preceding price increases 
multimode fiber was not affected as dramatically as single mode fiber due to the economic downturn  but there was a decline in volume in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of customers working down inventory 
pricing declined only to 
the company has started to see a recovery in multimode order volume since the beginning of while we anticipate improvement in product demand and pricing over the course of the next year  these trends in both demand and pricing for fiber  while part of a periodic cycle in the industry  cannot be assured of reversing themselves in any certain time frame 
if these factors do not improve  the company will continue to be adversely affected which could result in continuing pressure on gross margins  further losses and negative cash flows from operations 
this could impact on the company s ability to meet its current obligations and to raise additional capital 
the company continues to focus on reducing product and sg a costs to minimize the effect of the above trends while continuing to invest in development efforts to position the company for the expected rebound in the industry 
additionally  the company has the ability to utilize the remaining  of the equity line of credit with crescent to meet capital needs in the company currently has a backlog of approximately  up from  at the end of approximately  of this backlog is currently scheduled for delivery in this number may change as a result of re pricing mechanisms in the company s contracts and rescheduling due to changing business conditions 
all backlog numbers are calculated based on pricing levels in effect as of the date indicated 
the backlog does not include any orders taken or anticipated in the increase in the order backlog reflects the strong market for fiber during the first half of  which resulted in the company booking a significant number of multi year contracts  as well as the company s position as the only pure fiber supplier in the western hemisphere and europe 
the company also had additional bookings in the second half of as it added new business in the asia pacific region 
however  these bookings were more than offset by the shipments during the period and the re pricing of existing backlog under the periodic price setting structure of most of the company s long term contracts with customers 
the company also experienced rescheduling from many of its customers  particularly in the south american market  which had the effect of pushing out the planned delivery schedule of the backlog 
the company intends to capitalize on the expected long term growth of the fiber optics industry by constructing a number of facilities to produce optical fiber and preforms  using a well balanced  phased in approach for the establishment of these facilities 
a second and larger facility in jena  germany has recently completed construction and had its grand opening in february the capacity levels will be increasing throughout and as new equipment is brought online at this facility 
the financing required for this expansion has been secured 
this new facility will improve manufacturing efficiency  increase the company s competitiveness in the marketplace  and more than double previous capacity levels in the first phase of the expansion and increase total capacity in jena by over when both phases of the expansion come online 
the company s brazilian subsidiary  xtal  has a current capacity of approximately  kms of single mode fiber per year 
with the integration of fibercore and xtal technologies and some additional investment  this capacity is expected to more than double within the next years 
the technology integration has already had an effect  increasing xtal s capacity from approximately  kms in the plant also has available excess building space as well as land for new construction  which will allow the company to add auxiliary processing equipment to further increase capacity more rapidly 
the company had initiated expansion plans at xtal before the recent slowdown in the marketplace 
the schedule for this expansion has been delayed as a result of the slowdown in the single mode market 
however  the company will continue to install new equipment that is designed to improve margins 
in the longer term  the company is planning on new facilities in south africa  the united states and asia 
the company plans to finance the expansions through a combination of long term borrowings  government grants  equity placements  and customer and internal financing 
dci fibercore is currently a small portion of the company s revenue stream with  in revenue in the company expects that this entity will be a rapidly growing portion of its business in the coming years 
the combination of dci s capabilities in designing  installing and maintaining telecommunications networks with the equipment capabilities of alt should improve the sales potential of both parts of dci 
in june  the company concluded a financing arrangement with crescent international ltd 
with respect to a  commitment 
through a series of transactions in  the company sold  of securities pursuant to the arrangement and as of december   the company could require crescent to purchase up to  of additional shares of common stock  based on a market based pricing formula  subject to certain terms and limitations set forth in the company s agreements with crescent and with respect to which crescent has registration rights 
in december  the company closed on a  five year revolving credit loan agreement with fleet national bank  but the maximum principal amount of the loan decreases by  on december  and each subsequent year 
loan payments  in the amount of  may be made by way of a reduction in the amount available under the credit facility 
as of december  the company borrowed  these funds were used to increase the capitalization of fcj with respect to fcj s  project financing  which closed in january the financing included approximately  in loans and equipment leases  and  in grants from agencies of the german government 
the company contributed the balance of the funds 
the company is not relying on the conversion of warrants and options to fund its expansion plans  however  if all of the outstanding in the money warrants and options as of march  are exercised for cash  the total proceeds that the company would receive upon the exercise is approximately  some of these options and warrants have a cashless exercise feature  which could reduce the actual amount realized upon exercise 
in addition  a substantial amount of the company s outstanding loans are long term 
aside from the fleet loan  principal under the berliner bank loan  which was assumed by sparkasse jena in  is due and payable in  however  interest at is paid quarterly 
the following changes in balance sheet amounts are net of the effect of the change in the currency exchange rates from december  to december  year ended december  the company generated negative cash flow from operations of  for  compared to positive cash flow from operations of  for the decrease in operating cash flow resulted primarily from the reduction of net income excluding the non cash interest expense in compared to of  that was primarily due to net losses in the second half of the year of  the build up in finished goods inventory by  most of which occurred during the second half of the year due to the dramatic reduction in sales  as compared to a reduction of inventory in of  a change in accrued expenses and advance payments from customers of  as compared to due to the utilization of a  advance payment by a customer  an increase of only  in accounts payable in as compared to an increase of  in  and an increase in other receivables of  compared to a  increase in  primarily related to a  deposit due from a vendor in the first half of this will be paid during the second quarter  an increase in refundable taxes in both germany amounting to  and in brazil amounting to  these taxes are essentially vat taxes  which are based upon raw materials and equipment purchases and refunded on the basis of future sales 
the positive cash flow for the prior year included a  charge for non cash interest expense 
the foreign exchange gains were attributable to the weakness of the japanese yen versus the brazilian real and the us dollar in the fourth quarter of the year 
during the third quarter  one of the company s larger south american customers breached its contract with xtal 
this breach consisted of missed payments of  for accounts receivable and the subsequent suspension of shipments starting in july 
the cumulative effect of this breach  together with a lower demand from other customers  had a negative impact on cash flow during the quarter for xtal 
as a result of this situation  the company had an increase in inventory levels at the end of the third quarter and therefore reduced production levels at the brazilian facility during the third and fourth quarters 
the company also increased its short term borrowings during the second half of the year to compensate for the reduced cash flow from operations during the period 
the company reached a resolution with this customer in october as of the end of january  all of the outstanding receivables owed by the customer have been collected 
the company is currently negotiating with the customer with respect to shipments for the company is currently active in the asian market and expects to increase shipments to that market in  after initial orders were taken and shipped in the fourth quarter of the company is also focusing on increasing its shipments of multimode fiber out of xtal in the company has temporarily slowed its capacity expansion at xtal  although expenditures for equipment that are expected to reduce production costs will continue in the company invested  in new equipment and facilities for both major locations during  with most of the investment occurring in germany 
a new manufacturing facility was constructed for fcj as part of the expansion process there and the grand opening was held in february the company will continue to equip this new facility throughout and a building was acquired in jena  germany to house the new machines that will be the initial operations of fibercore glas  which will begin production of glass tubes in the second half of using the company s recently patented povd process 
grant funds received related to the expansion in germany amounted to  these funds reduce the cost basis of the assets acquired 
cash paid in connection with the dci acquisition was  while cash acquired with the dci acquisition was the company received proceeds of long term debt of  during these funds were used for the purchase of equipment and facilities at the company s german and brazilian locations to fund the expansion of these locations and for general working capital 
in january of  long term debt was reduced by  as a result of the conversion by crescent international  ltd 
of such debt into  shares of common stock of the company 
upon conversion  the interest associated with the debt was waived 
additionally  there were principal payments on long term debt for the year of  proceeds of short term notes payable amounted to  for these notes were used primarily for short term working capital purposes in brazil 
short term notes for xtal amounting to  were paid during on august   the company replaced its existing equity line of credit with crescent international ltd 
crescent  which had an availability of  with a new equity line with crescent providing for the same availability 
the new agreement extends the period during which crescent can be obligated to purchase the company s common stock and contains several positive features  including a pricing mechanism more advantageous to the company 
the company received net proceeds of  upon the sale of common stock to crescent on august  pursuant to the new agreement  and net proceeds of  upon an additional sale on october  the proceeds from the foregoing sales to crescent were used to fund capacity expansion and for other corporate purposes 
the company anticipates utilizing a portion of the remaining  of this equity line to reduce its short term loans during on january   the company announced that it closed on a private placement of  in convertible subordinated debentures to institutional investors  with the option to increase the total dollar amount up to  under the terms of the transaction  fibercore received  at closing and will receive an additional  upon the effectiveness of a registration statement  which was filed on february  in connection with the transaction 
each of the parties has an option to place up to an additional  of the debentures under certain conditions  provided  the aggregate additional placement does not exceed  the proceeds will be used to support fibercore s capital expenditure program  including the recently announced capacity expansion and productivity initiatives in germany  initial funding for fibercore africa and other corporate purposes 
as of december   contractual cash obligations  commitments and contingencies of the company were as follows contractual cash obligations less than after dollars in total year years years years thousands notes payable   long term debt     capital lease obligations    operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations      refers to raw material purchase requirements under take or pay agrees as part of our ordinary course of business 
year ended december  for the year ended december   the company generated  in cash from operating activities 
this was a major improvement over the  used for operating activities in this significant improvement was due primarily to the increase in sales and gross profit  higher depreciation costs and other non cash costs incurred  including a non cash interest charge of  in accounts receivable increased by  due to the significant increase in sales in and the acquisition of xtal compared to inventory decreased by  also due to the increase in sales 
accounts payable increased by  in due to a decrease in payables at the parent company offset by an increase at fcj and as a result of the acquisition of xtal 
during  the company invested  in fixed assets  principally for the expansion project at fcj and for equipment purchases at xtal 
cash paid for the acquisition of xtal amounted to  the company received net proceeds of  from the sale of common stock  principally from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock by tyco  and by tyco s  purchases of common stock 
the company received proceeds from long term debt  net of repayment of  the principal proceeds of long term debt were  of convertible notes from crescent   of which  was converted to common shares of the company prior to year end and  that was converted in january 
the company also received  from fleet bank  that was used for the expansion at fcj 
loan repayments in addition to the crescent conversion included repayment of  to algar  used for the xtal acquisition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation

in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company will adopt this new standard beginning january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but will be subject to an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company anticipates that the adoption of this new standard will result in the discontinuation of annual goodwill amortization of approximately  in we have not completed our initial assessment of recoverability 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no

the company will adopt this new standard beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have material impact on the statement of financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company has two principal operating subsidiaries  which are located in foreign counties 
fcj is located in germany and its functional currency is the euro 
xtal is located in brazil and its functional currency is the brazilian real 
foreign currency risk 
fcj may  from time to time  purchase short term forward exchange contracts to hedge payments and or receipts due in currencies other than the euro or deutsche mark dm 
at december   fcj did not have any outstanding forward exchange contracts 
at december   the company had a long term loan denominated in dm totaling dm  the principal of the loan is due at maturity  september interest on the loan is payable quarterly at the fixed rate of per annum 
a change in the dm exchange rate to the us dollar could increase or decrease the interest cash flow requirements of the company by approximately  for each of the years through  and by approximately  in substantially all of the company s sales are through fcj  and xtal  with a relatively small contribution from dci 
additionally  at december     and of the company s assets are at its german  brazilian  and malaysian subsidiaries  respectively 
the company  therefore  is subject to foreign currency translation gains or losses in reporting its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
at december   the company had a long term loan with an interest rate based on the prime rate or libor 
the company selects either one  two or three month libor based on prevailing market rates 
a change in the interest rates on this loan would have increased or decreased interest expense by approximately  for the remainder of this page intentionally left blank
