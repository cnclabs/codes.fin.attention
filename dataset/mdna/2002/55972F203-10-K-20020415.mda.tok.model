item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes associated with them contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future 
such discussion represents only the best present assessment by management of the company 
the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by our success in acquiring oil and gas properties and our ability to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production through exploration and exploitation activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices have also significantly affected the results of operations 
on december   the company through its newly formed owned subsidiary  bluebird  acquired from spirit energy spirit natural gas reserves and associated assets in producing fields located in oklahoma and texas in the total amount of million 
the effective date of the acquisition was december  as part of the capitalization of bluebird  the company contributed  units of tel offshore trust 
bluebird  as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined under certain credit agreements  is neither a guarantor of the company s senior notes due nor can it be included in determining compliance with certain financial covenants under the company s credit agreements 
on june   the company and bluebird acquired oil and gas reserves and related assets from vastar including interests in wells  a gas processing plant and two gas gathering systems located in the states of texas  oklahoma and arkansas in the total amount of million 
the effective date of the acquisition was april  on december  bluebird acquired a ownership interest in the madill gas processing plant and associated gathering system located in marshall and bryan counties  oklahoma in the total amount of million 
the effective date of the acquisition was november  effective september  the company acquired a net profits interest in the panoma production and gas gathering facilities for million of the company s restricted common stock 
by acquiring this interest  the company lowered its lease operating expense  increased oil field services income  and reduced a permanent burden on this property 
effective april  the company exchanged interests with another oil and gas company in certain onshore oil producing properties for interests in certain offshore oil and gas producing properties and production facilities located in the gulf of mexico in a tax free like kind exchange 
the transaction did not have a material effect on reported production in  but the company gained significantly increased exposure in an offshore area of interest where it continues to conduct active exploration and development activities 
during  we realized proceeds of million from the sale of non core oil and gas and other properties  of which approximately million was attributable to bluebird 
effective july   the company acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in southeast new mexico totaling approximately bcfe of reserves for million  net of purchase price adjustments 
the transaction had an effective date of july  on december   the company announced a merger with prize energy corp 
prize  an independent oil and gas development and production company 
the merger was completed on march  the transaction has been accounted for as a purchase of prize by the company in accordance with the provisions of fas under the terms of the merger  the company has distributed shares of common stock plus in cash for each prize share outstanding 
the following summary  prepared on a pro forma basis  presents the results of operations for the years ended december  and as if the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of the respective years 
the pro forma information includes the effects of adjustments for interest expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and income taxes unaudited in thousands  except for per share amounts revenue   total operating costs and expenses   operating profit   interest expense and other   income before tax   provision for income tax   extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt

the period results include a loss on enron related assets of million  a provision for impairment of investments of million  and an extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt of thousand  net of tax benefits  from the repurchase of million of the company s senior notes 
total operating revenues increased to million in from million in and operating profit decreased to million in from million in a increase in the price received for oil and gas sold on a thousand cubic feet equivalent  or mcfe  basis  combined with a increase in oil and gas production on a million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  basis in our oil and gas exploration and production segment was primarily responsible for the improvement in revenues  while higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the enron related loss were primarily responsible for the increase in operating costs and expenses 
income applicable to common shares was million in the period versus million in the period  an increase of 
income per common share diluted was per share in the period compared to per share diluted  in the period  a decrease of due to a increase in diluted shares 
the effect of the extraordinary loss in the period was per share  basic and diluted 
no dividends were recorded in the period due to the conversion of million liquidation value of our series a convertible preferred stock on january  into approximately million shares of our common stock 
we had previously redeemed million liquidation value of the series a convertible preferred stock in december  and bluebird acquired of our million liquidation value in series a convertible preferred stock during oil and gas operations for the year ended december   we reported oil production of mmbbls million barrels and gas production of  mmcf million cubic feet  which represents an increase of in oil and an increase of in gas produced from the comparable period in our reported equivalent daily rate of production on a million cubic feet per day basis mmcfe day increased to mmcfe day in the period from mmcfe day in the period 
these increases were primarily the result of the success of our drilling program offsetting normal production declines 
prices realized in the period averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
this represents a increase on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis over the period average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
the unit prices realized include the effects of hedging 
during the period  hedging increased the average price we received for oil by per barrel and the average price we received for gas by per mcf 
excluding the effects of hedging  oil prices declined and natural gas prices declined in from those received in as a result of higher realized prices and higher production levels  oil and gas revenues increased to million in the period compared to million in the period 
for the period  oil and gas production lifting costs  on a unit of production basis  were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the period  an increase of 
production tax and other costs were per mcfe in the period compared to per mcfe in the period  a decline of  principally due to lower production taxes 
lower production taxes are a result of lower oil and gas prices before the effect of hedge transactions and higher production levels in the gulf of mexico on which no production taxes are levied 
gross margin for oil and gas operations for the period was million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe in the period  an increase of on a per unit of production basis  primarily as a result of higher oil and gas prices realized and the increase in our daily unit production rate 
gathering  marketing and processing operations for the year ended december   our gathering systems throughput was mmcf per day versus mmcf per day for the same period in  a decline of due to normal production declines behind the systems 
gas processing throughput was mmcf per day in versus mmcf per day in  a decrease of 
our reported processing throughput in the period was reduced due to i the sale in september of a substantial ownership interest in oil and gas properties supplying one of our plants  ii the voluntary shutdown of two gas processing plants for approximately months of the period due to adverse processing economics as a result of high natural gas prices and iii normal production declines on properties supplying the plants 
revenues from gathering  marketing and processing decreased to million in versus million in  primarily due to a decline in natural gas liquids prices and a decrease in throughput 
operating costs for the gathering  marketing and processing segment increased to million in from million in the gross margin realized from gathering  marketing and processing for was million versus million in  a decrease of 
gathering margin was per mcf gathered in versus per mcf in due to a decrease in marketing spreads and losses incurred on pipeline imbalance positions 
processing margin was per mcf in compared to per mcf in due to less favorable processing economics because of the decline in natural gas liquids prices and the temporary shutdown of two plants for a portion of the period 
oil field management services operations revenues from oil field management services were million in the period versus million in the period due to higher management and operations services fees charged to third parties  primarily on offshore operations 
operating costs increased to million in from thousand in due to higher costs for labor and overhead 
the gross margin for this segment in was thousand versus thousand in  an increase of other income and expenses depreciation and depletion expense was million in the period versus million in the period  an increase of due to higher production levels and higher unit costs 
depreciation and depletion on oil and gas properties was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in this increase in the equivalent unit cost was due primarily to an increase in development costs associated with our exploration efforts in the gulf of mexico 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from million in the principal cause of this increase was an increase in salary  benefits and retirement plan expenses and an increase in the company s overall headcount associated with its increased activity level 
the number of personnel employed by the company at fiscal year end and were and  respectively 
we recorded equity in earnings of affiliate of million in versus income of million in  a decrease  due to decreased net earnings from gas marketing operations of the company s owned affiliate 
other income was thousand for versus thousand in  a decrease  due to a reduction in interest income 
we made provision for a million loss on assets associated with the enron corp 
bankruptcy in the period 
of the total loss provision recorded  approximately million was related to accounts receivable for enron for physical gas sales and approximately thousand was related to a receivable from a natural gas commodity hedge in which enron was the counterparty 
the company had equity and debt investments in a privately held entity which declared bankruptcy subsequent to december   and for which the company provided an impairment charge against earnings of million at december  additionally  the company had an investment in available for sale securities of another entity of million at december  because of the deteriorating financial condition of this entity  the company reported an other than temporary impairment of million as a charge against earnings at december   based on the entity s reported market value on that date 
interest expense was million for versus million for  a decrease of 
during the period  the interest rate on our primarily libor based bank debt was versus in  a decline of 
the weighted average daily balance of bank debt increased to million in from million in we also benefitted in the period by the repurchase of million of our senior notes in june  in addition  interest expense was reduced in the period by thousand as a result of interest rate derivatives versus an increase in interest expense of thousand from interest rate derivatives in the period 
we recorded a total provision for income tax expense of million in versus million in  an increase of 
we made no adjustment to the valuation allowance charged against deferred tax assets in the period  whereas the period benefitted from a million reduction in the valuation allowance charged against deferred tax assets 
there were no dividends applicable to preferred stock in as compared to million for the period 
the elimination of the dividend was due to the purchase  redemption and conversion of all of the company s outstanding dividend paying preferred stock not controlled by wholly owned entities 
for the years ended december  and we reported record net income of million for the year ended december  versus a net loss of million for the same period in total operating revenues increased to million and operating profit increased to million in a increase in the price received for oil and gas sold on a thousand cubic feet equivalent  or mcfe  basis  combined with a increase in oil and gas production on a million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe  basis in our oil and gas exploration and production segment was primarily responsible for these results 
we also reported significant increases in revenues and gross operating margins from our gas gathering  marketing and processing and oil field services segments in compared to due to improved product prices and processing economics and an increase in customers for whom we are providing operations services 
income applicable to common shares was million in versus a loss applicable to common shares of million in income per common share basic was per share and income per common share diluted was per share in compared to a loss applicable to common shares of per share  both basic and diluted  in income per share in includes the effect of a million non recurring fee paid upon redemption of million liquidation value of our series a convertible preferred stock 
the fee was treated as a dividend  which reduced income per common share  basic and diluted  by per share and per share  respectively  for the year oil and gas operations for the year  we reported oil production of  mbbls thousand barrels and gas production of  mmcf million cubic feet  which represents a decline of in oil and an increase of in gas produced from our reported equivalent daily rate of production on a million cubic feet per day basis mmcfe day increased to mmcfe day in the reported production in was impacted by the sale of certain non core oil and gas properties which took effect in june and september excluding the production of these properties from both periods  our underlying oil production increased and our underlying gas production increased in compared to  with the underlying equivalent daily rate of production increasing to mmcfe day 
these increases were the result of a full year of production from the properties acquired from vastar being included in as well as the success of our drilling program offsetting normal production declines 
the increase in oil and gas prices was the most significant factor affecting the increase in net income in prices realized in averaged per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
this represents a increase on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis over average realized prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
the unit prices realized include the effects of commodity hedging 
from time to time  we enter into various commodity hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices 
during  commodity hedging reduced the average price we received for oil by per barrel and for gas by per mcf 
during  we had approximately of our natural gas production and of our oil production hedged 
beginning january  we had approximately of our expected natural gas production hedged for at a weighted average price using cost less collars of to per mcf and we had approximately of our expected crude oil production for the first six months of hedged at a weighted average price using cost less collars of to per barrel 
primarily as a result of higher realized prices  oil and gas revenues increased to million in compared to million in lease operating expenses consist of two components  lifting costs and production tax and other costs 
for  lifting costs  on a unit of production basis  were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in  an increase of 
this increase in lifting costs per unit was due to a general increase in costs of labor  materials and field services stimulated by higher prices for oil and natural gas 
production tax and other costs were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in  an increase of 
this was principally due to an increase of per mcfe in production taxes  which are a function of higher oil and gas prices  and an increase in company overhead charged to oil and gas operations of per mcfe due principally to higher labor and benefit costs 
our gross margin for oil and gas operations oil and gas revenues less lease operating expenses for was million  or per mcfe  compared to million  or per mcfe in  an increase of on a per unit of production basis  primarily as a result of higher oil and gas prices 
gathering  marketing and processing operations for  our gathering system throughput was mmcf per day versus mmcf per day in  a decline of due to the sale of a gathering system in june and to normal production declines behind the system 
gas processing throughput was mmcf per day in versus mmcf per day in  a decrease of 
during december  we completed recoupment of our original investment in the mclean gas processing plant 
as a result  our share of operating income and plant throughput reverted to from the applicable during the recoupment period 
the decline in reported throughput at mclean was partially offset by our acquisition of a interest in the madill gas processing plant in december also  our reported throughput at another plant was reduced beginning june due to the sale of an interest in oil and gas properties supplying the plant 
revenues from gathering  marketing and processing increased to million in versus million in of this increase  million was due to the acquisition of the madill plant 
also  we received significantly higher prices for natural gas and plant products sold in compared to natural gas prices increased while the price received for natural gas liquids increased 
the effect of price increases was seen at the mclean plant  where our revenues declined only despite the decline in our operating interest due to reversion 
operating costs for the gathering  marketing and processing segment increased to million in from million in a substantial portion of this increase was due to the acquisition of the madill plant 
our net share of costs at the mclean plant declined only despite the reversion to a operating interest due to higher natural gas prices affecting the cost of plant throughput 
higher natural gas prices also affected the cost of gas marketed 
the gross margin realized from gathering  marketing and processing for was million versus million in  an increase of 
gathering margin was per mcf in versus in due to an increase in marketing spreads 
processing margin was per mcf in compared to per mcf in due to higher prices for plant products and better processing economics 
oil field services operations revenues from oil field services were million in versus thousand in due to an increase in customers for whom we provided operations services 
operating costs increased to thousand in from thousand in due to higher costs for labor and overhead 
the gross margin for this segment in was thousand versus thousand in  an increase of other income and expenses depreciation and depletion expense was million in versus million in depreciation and depletion on oil and gas properties was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in this increase in the equivalent unit cost was due to an increase in development costs associated with our exploration efforts in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation expense for the gathering  marketing and processing segment increased by thousand in due to the madill plant acquisition 
for  we recorded a gain on sale of thousand versus a gain on sale of thousand in the gain on sale in both periods relates to the sale of property other than oil and gas properties 
since we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties  proceeds from the sale of those properties are applied to the full cost pool and no gain or loss is recognized 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from million in the principal cause of this increase was a million increase in salary  benefits and retirement plan expenses as a result of higher headcount  year end incentive bonuses  and esop expense resulting from appreciation in the company s stock price 
the difference between the stock value on the contribution date and the stock value when purchased must be expensed at the date the contribution is made to the esop 
we recorded equity in earnings of affiliate of million in versus a loss of thousand in this increase was due to increased net earnings from gas marketing operations of the affiliate 
other income was thousand for versus thousand in the increase was caused by an increase in interest income 
interest expense was million for versus million for during most of  the interest rate on our libor based bank debt and an interest rate swap were higher than in this was offset by a decrease in outstanding libor based bank debt in the latter part of due to reducing debt from cash raised from the sale of non core oil and gas properties and the exercise of warrants and options for our common stock 
we recorded a total provision for income tax expense of million in versus none in the year provision included a thousand current provision due to alternative minimum tax regulations 
the provision for deferred income tax expense of million in reflects a reduction of million in the valuation allowance charged against our deferred tax asset 
we made this reduction in the valuation allowance in after consideration of current production levels  current expectations regarding near term oil and gas prices  current commodity hedging positions  anticipated capital expenditures  the estimated reversal of book and tax temporary differences  available tax planning strategies and expectations regarding future taxable income 
the valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the factors previously discussed 
no income tax benefit was provided in because of uncertainty at that time in our ability to realize additional tax benefits on our net operating losses in the future 
dividends applicable to preferred stock were million for versus million in the dividends in included the million premium non recurring on redemption of million liquidation value of our series a convertible preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the substantial increase in our operating cash flows in over and over is primarily the result of higher net realized oil and gas prices and higher production levels 
in the period compared to the period  a reduction in trade accounts receivable and an increase in trade accounts payable balances also contributed to increased operating cash flows 
our net working capital position at december  was a deficit of million 
on that date  we had available million under our senior bank credit facility 
several items contributed to the deficit in working capital  including a delay in obtaining million of sale and leaseback financing of offshore production platforms until january  the million loss we sustained as a result of the enron bankruptcy  and the postponement of negotiations for the expected million sale of certain assets  also a result of uncertainty in the marketplace caused by enron 
we also cancelled plans to sell an interest in a recent gulf of mexico discovery for million because of falling oil and gas prices in the fourth quarter of and general market uncertainties 
subsequent to december   several actions taken by management eliminated this deficit in working capital 
see magnum hunter s liquidity and capital resources later in this discussion for a more complete description of these actions

bluebird remains an unrestricted subsidiary under the company s senior bank credit agreement 
at december   bluebird had no capital spending plans or commitments and no remaining debt or interest payment requirements 
magnum hunter s liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion of magnum hunter s capital resources refers to the company and its affiliates other than bluebird  whose capital resources were discussed separately above 
internally generated cash flow and the borrowing capacity under its senior bank credit line are the company s major sources of liquidity 
from time to time  the company may also sell oil and gas properties in order to increase liquidity 
in addition  the company may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  as sources to fund acquisitions or other specific needs 
in the past  the company has accessed both public and private capital markets to provide liquidity for specific activities and general corporate purposes 
in december  the company used million in cash to purchase of its series a convertible preferred stock outstanding from bluebird 
this preferred stock was held by another owned affiliate for possible re issue at a later date 
also in december  the company spent million including a million redemption premium to redeem of its outstanding series a convertible preferred stock 
in january  the remaining of this preferred stock was converted by the holder to the company s common stock at the conversion price of per share 
as a result of the redemption of its series a convertible preferred stock  the company saved million in annual dividend payments 
in may  the company reissued the million of its series a convertible preferred stock to bluebird in connection with the acquisition of bluebird s oil and gas properties 
the company will make dividend payments of thousand annually to bluebird  however  such payments are eliminated under consolidated financial reporting 
on may   the company closed on a new million senior bank credit facility  of which million was available under the borrowing base at december  the credit agreement provides for both libor and base rate prime interest rate options 
this new credit facility consolidated and replaced both the company s and bluebird s previous credit facilities 
at december   borrowings under this line were million  leaving availability of million on that date versus a deficit in working capital of million excluding bluebird 
as described below  the company entered into several courses of action to remedy this working capital shortfall 
on a semiannual basis  the borrowing base is redetermined by the banks based on their review of the company s oil and gas reserves 
if the outstanding senior bank debt exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  the company must repay the excess 
on december   the company announced that a distribution of one warrant for every five shares of common stock owned on january  these warrants were distributed on march  each new warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at the warrants will expire three years from the date of distribution 
on january   the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction on three newly constructed offshore production platforms and associated pipelines that were recently placed into service 
the company received a total of million in new funding which was used for general corporate purposes including a voluntary reduction under the company s corporate bank revolving credit facility 
the production platforms are being leased from a syndicate group of lenders over a term of three years and at a cost of funds of approximately per annum  based on current interest rates 
this transaction will be accounted for as a capital lease 
on march   the company amended and restated its senior bank credit facility the facility in conjunction with the merger with prize 
the amended facility provides for total borrowings of million  up from million  and raises the borrowing base limit from million to million 
on march   the company borrowed million against the facility  leaving million of excess credit line for working capital and other corporate purposes 
on march   the company also completed a private placement of million of senior notes the private placement due that are unsecured 
interest on the senior notes bear an annual rate of due semi annually  commencing september  with the funds provided by the new facility and the private placement of senior notes  the company repaid indebtedness under its old credit facility of million  repaid debt under prize s previous credit agreement of million  funded the cash component of the merger consideration of million  and paid other fees and expenses related to the merger  facility and private placement of approximately million 
in connection with the merger with prize  the company issued  shares of its common stock to prize shareholders  increasing its total shares outstanding by 
also in connection with the merger with prize   prize warrants remain outstanding and are exercisable at for up to a total of  shares of the company s common stock 
these warrants expire in november additionally   prize warrants remain outstanding and are exercisable at for up to  shares of the company s common stock 
these warrants expire in june the company s internally generated cash flow  results of operations  and financing for its operations are dependent on oil and gas prices 
to the extent that oil and gas prices decline  the company s earnings and cash flows may be adversely affected 
capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   the company s total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million 
the following summarizes the company s capital expenditures by cost component in millions oil gas properties other unproved proved property total acquisition costs exploration costs development costs total acquisition costs include million for unproved and million for proved reserves in the mallon acquisition and million for the purchase of additional proved reserves in south timbalier block as of december   the company had total unproved oil and gas property costs of million  consisting of million of property acquisition costs and million of exploration costs 
for the year  the company has budgeted approximately million for exploration and development activities  including million on properties acquired in the prize merger 
we anticipate that the capital expenditure budget will be funded by cash flow from operations and credit facility utilization 
the company is not contractually obligated to proceed with any of its material budgeted capital expenditures 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within the company s control or ability to forecast  including drilling results  oilfield costs  and changes in oil and gas prices 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
in the normal course of business  the company reviews opportunities for the possible acquisition of oil and gas reserves and activities related thereto 
when potential acquisition opportunities are deemed consistent with the company s growth strategy  bids or offers in amounts and with terms acceptable to the company may be submitted 
it is uncertain whether any such bids or offers which may be submitted by the company from time to time will be acceptable to the sellers 
in the event of a future significant acquisition  the company may require additional financing in connection therewith 
the company does not budget for acquisition expenditures 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than years years after years year long term debt    notes payable   operating leases    total contractual obligations     we have commercial commitments in the form of guarantees on a several basis to trade creditors of our owned affiliate  ngts  llc 
the total amount committed as of december  is  the guarantees expire up to one year from the dates of original issuance 
critical accounting policies and other our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial results are reliable and that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries 
the company consolidates on a pro rata basis its approximately  as of at december   ownership of tel offshore trust 
the company accounts for its investment in ngts  llc under the equity method 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain items in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
the company is a holding company with no significant assets or operations other than its investments in its subsidiaries 
the wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  except for bluebird energy  inc bluebird  are direct guarantors of the company s senior notes and have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes on a joint and several basis 
the guarantors comprise all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company other than bluebird  and the company has presented separate condensed consolidating financial statements and other disclosures concerning each guarantor and bluebird see note to the consolidated financial statements 
there is no restriction on the ability of consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to the company in the form of cash dividends  and  except for bluebird  loans or advances 
oil and gas properties the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas proved reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool on a country by country basis as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved oil and gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
to the extent that such capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes exceed the pv of estimated future net cash flow from proved reserves of oil and gas  and the lower of unamortized cost or fair value of unproved properties after income tax effects  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices subsequently increase 
the company s capitalized costs exceeded the pv limitation utilizing prices in effect at december  by million 
however  no writedown for impairment of oil and gas properties was required as a result of the increase in oil and gas prices subsequent to december  significant downward revisions of quantity estimates  declines in oil and gas prices  higher operating costs or additional capital costs which are not offset by incremental increases in oil and gas reserves or other factors could possibly result in a write down for impairment of oil and gas properties in the future 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment

we follow the sales method of accounting for revenue for oil and natural gas production  so that we recognize sales revenue on all production sold to purchasers  regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves 
ultimate revenues from the sales of oil and gas production is not known with certainty until up to three months after production and title transfer occur 
current revenues are accrued based on our expectation of actual deliveries and actual prices received 
inflation and changes in prices the results of operations and cash flow of the company have been  and will continue to be  affected by the volatility in oil and gas prices 
should the company experience a significant increase in oil and gas prices that is sustained over a prolonged period  it would expect that there would also be a corresponding increase in oil and gas finding costs  lease acquisition costs  and operating expenses 
the company markets oil and gas for its own account  which exposes the company to the attendant commodities risk 
a significant portion of the company s gas production is currently sold to a owned affiliate  ngts  llc  or end users either i on the spot market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or ii under long term contracts based on current spot market prices 
the company normally sells its oil under month to month contracts to a variety of purchasers 
hedging periodically the company enters into futures  options  and swap contracts to reduce the adverse effects of fluctuations in crude oil and gas prices and interest rates 
it is the policy of the company to not enter into any such commodity hedging arrangements which cause the company s aggregate commodity hedge position to exceed of the oil and gas production during the projected next months 
we also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest on our outstanding debt 
generally  the cash settlement of all derivative instruments is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized
