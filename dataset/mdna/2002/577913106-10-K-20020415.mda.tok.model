item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto which are contained in item results of operations aluminum operations industry overview aluminum operations account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues and operating results 
kaiser  through its principal subsidiary kacc  operates in the following business segments bauxite and alumina  primary aluminum  flat rolled products  engineered products and commodities marketing 
kaiser uses a portion of its bauxite  alumina and primary aluminum production for additional processing at certain of its downstream facilities 
intersegment transfers are valued at estimated market prices 
reorganization proceedings on february   kaiser  kacc and of kacc s wholly owned subsidiaries filed separate voluntary petitions in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on march   two additional subsidiaries o f kacc filed petitions 
none of kaiser s non us affiliates were included in the cases 
the cases are being jointly administered with the debtors managing their businesses in the ordinary course as debtors in possession subject to the control and supervision of the court 
the necessity for filing the cases was attributable to the liquidity and cash flow problems of kaiser arising in late and early kaiser was facing significant near term debt maturities at a time of unusually weak aluminum industry business conditions  depressed aluminum prices and a broad economic slowdown that was further exacerbated by the events of september  in addition  kaiser had become increasingly burdened by the asbestos litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and growing legacy obligations for retiree medical and pension costs see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the confluence of these factors has created the prospect of continuing operating losses and negative cash flow for kaiser  resulting in lower credit ratings and an inability to access the capital markets 
kaiser s objective is to achieve the highest possible recoveries for all creditors and stockholders  consistent with the debtors abilities to pay and the continuation of their businesses 
however  there can be no assurance that the debtors will be able to attain these objectives or achieve a successful reorganization 
further  there can be no assurance that the liabilities of the debtors will not be found in the cases to exceed the fair value of their assets this could result in claims being paid at less than of their face value an d the equity of kaiser s stockholders being diluted or cancelled 
at this time  i t is not possible to predict the outcome of the cases  in general  or the effect of the cases on the businesses of the debtors or on the interests of creditors and stockholders 
the accompanying financial information of the company s aluminum segment and related discussions of financial condition and results of operations are based on the assumption that kaiser will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in th e ordinary course of business  however  as a result of the commencement of the cases  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to a significant number of uncertainties 
specifically  but not all inclusive  the financial information of kaiser for the year ended december   which is included in the company s consolidated results  contained herein does not present a the classification of any long term debt which is in default as a current liability  b the realizable value of assets on a liquidation basis or the availability of such assets to satisfy liabilities  c the amount which will ultimately be paid to settle liabilities and contingencies which may be allowed in the cases  or d the effect of any changes which may be made in connection with the company s investment in kaiser or with the debtors operations resulting from a plan of reorganization 
because of the ongoing nature of the cases  the discussions and financial information of kaiser contained herein are subject to material uncertainties 
kaiser s financial results will be included in the company s consolidated results until the filing date 
under generally accepted accounting principles  consolidation is generally required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these rules  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
hence  the company will be required to present its equity interest in the net assets of kaiser at the filing date as an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary and will not recognize any income or loss from kaiser in its results of operations during th e reorganization period 
the company believes additional losses related to its investment in kaiser are not probable  and accordingly  it expects to reverse its losses in excess of its investment in kaiser on february  any subsequent recovery in the fair value of the investment will not be recognized in earnings unless realized through a disposition of kaiser shares by the company 
in addition  the company expects to record a charge of approximately million during the first quarter of related to the company s equity share of kaiser s accumulated other comprehensive losses 
accumulated other comprehensive losses attributable to kaiser are primarily related to minimum pension liability adjustments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s investment in kaiser and kaiser s bankruptcy 
when and if kaiser emerges from the jurisdiction of the court  the subsequent accounting will be determined based upon the facts and circumstances at the time  including the terms of any plan of reorganization

the pro forma balance sheet presented above is prepared as kaiser had been deconsolidat ed on december  on april   kaiser filed with the court a motion seeking an order of the court prohibiting the company or mghi  without first seeking court relief  from making any disposition of its stock of kaiser  including any sale  transfer  or exchange of such stock or treating any of its kaiser stock as worthless for federal income tax purposes 
kaiser indicated in its court filing that it was concerned that such a transaction could have the effect of deprivin g kaiser of the ability to utilize the full value of its net operating losses  foreign tax credits and minimum tax credits 
the company is in the process of analyzing the motion and other materials which were filed with the court 
industry overview and selected operational data this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see item business general and below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
kaiser s operating results are sensitive to changes in the prices of alumina  primary aluminum  and fabricated aluminum products  and also depend to a significant degree on the volume and mix of all products sold and on kaiser s hedging strategies 
primary aluminum prices have historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of kaiser s hedging activities 
changes in global  regional  or country specific economic conditions can have a significant impact on overall demand for aluminum intensive fabricated products in the transportation  distribution  and packaging markets 
such changes in demand can directly affect kaiser s earnings by impacting the overal l volume and mix of such products sold 
to the extent that these end use markets weaken  demand can also diminish for what kaiser sometimes refers to as the upstream products alumina and primary aluminum 
during  the average midwest united states transaction price amt price per pound of primary aluminum began the year at 
per pound and then began a steady decrease ending at

during  the average amt price was

a metric ton is equivalent to  pounds 
shipments and net sales for  and included approximately  tons   tons and  tons  respectively  of alumina purchased from third parties 
beginning in the first quarter of  as a result of the continuing curtailment of kaiser s northwest smelters  the flat rolled products business unit began purchasing its own primary aluminum rather than relying on the primary aluminum business unit to supply its aluminum requirements through production or third party purchases 
the engineered products business unit was already responsible for purchasing the majorit y of its primary aluminum requirements 
during the years ended december   and  the primary aluminum business unit purchased approximately  tons   tons and  tons  respectively  of primary aluminum from third parties to meet existing third party commitments 
average realized prices for kaiser s flat rolled products and engineered products segments are not presented as such prices are subject to fluctuations due to changes in product mix

in addition to the items described in above  income loss before income taxes and minority interests included the impact of additional non recurring items of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
significant items pension plan the assets of kaiser s pension plans are  to a substantial degree  invested in the capital markets and managed by a third party 
given the performance of the financial markets during  kaiser was required to reflect an additional minimum pension liability of million net of income tax benefit of million in its financial statements as a result of a decline in the value of the assets held by kaiser s pension plans 
kaiser also anticipates that the decline in the value of the pension plans assets will unfavorably impact pension costs reflected in its operating results and could  over the longer term  increase pension funding requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussions of these matters 
sale of interest in qal in september  kaiser sold an approximate interest in qal and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of the transaction  kaiser now owns a interest in qal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the september sale 
start up related costs at gramercy facility initial production at kaiser s gramercy  louisiana  alumina refinery  which had been curtailed since july as a result of an explosion in the digestion area of the plant  commenced during the middle of december construction at the facility was substantially completed during the third quarter of during  the gramercy facility incurred abnormal related start up costs of approximately million 
these abnormal costs resulted from operating the plant in an interim and less efficient mode pending the completion of construction and reaching the plant s intended production rate an d efficiency 
during the first nine months of  the plant operated at approximately of its newly rated estimated capacity of  tons 
during the fourth quarter of  the plant operated at approximately of its newly rated capacity 
by the end of february  the plant was operating at just below of its newly rated capacity 
the facility is now focusing it s efforts on achieving its full operating efficiency 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the incident at the gramercy facility and the financial statement impact of gramercy related insurance recoveries 
labor matters from september through september  kaiser and the uswa were involved in a labor dispute as a result of the september uswa strike and the subsequent lock out by kaiser in february although the uswa dispute has been settled and the workers have returned to the facilities  two allegations of ulps in connection with the uswa strike and subsequent lock out by kaiser remain to be resolved 
kaiser believes that the remaining charges mad e against kaiser by the uswa are without merit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the ulp charges 
pacific northwest power sales and operating level during  kaiser kept its northwest smelters curtailed and sold the remaining power available that it had under contract through september kaiser has the right to purchase sufficient power from the bpa to operate its trentwood facility as well as approximately of the capacity of its northwes t aluminum smelting operations 
given recent primary aluminum prices and the forward price of power in the northwest  it is unlikely that kaiser would operate more than a portion of its northwest smelting capacity in the near future 
operating only a portion of the northwest capacity would result in production cost inefficiencies such that operating results would  at best be breakeven to modestly negative at long term primary aluminum prices 
however  operating at such a reduced rate could  depending on prevailing economics  result in improved cash flows as opposed to remaining curtailed and incurring kaiser s fixed and continuing labor and other costs 
this is because kaiser is liable for certain severance  supplemental unemployment and early retirement benefits for the uswa workers at the curtailed smelters 
a substantial portion of such costs have been accrued through early however  additional accrual s may be required depending on when the uswa workers are recalled and when the smelting operations are restarted 
such amounts could be material with a presen t value in the million to million range 
however  most of such costs would be related to pension and post retirement medical benefits and would likely be paid out over an extended period 
additionally  beginning october  kaiser could be liable for certain take or pay obligations under the bpa contract and such amounts could be significant 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the power sales  kaiser s contract rights and obligations and additional detail regarding possible incremental liabilities with respect to the uswa workers 
strategic initiatives in may  kaiser announced that it had launched a performance improvement initiative designed to increase operating cash flow  generate cash from inventory reduction and improve kaiser s financial flexibility 
during  kaiser recorded charges of million see note to the consolidated financial statements in connection with the program 
additional cash and non cash charges may be required in the future as the program continues 
such additional charges could be material 
net sales net sales for the year ended december   decreased from the year ago period primarily due to a decrease in average realized prices for alumina and primary aluminum as well as a decline in shipments of primary aluminum  flat rolled products and engineered products 
these decreases in prices and shipments were partially offset by an increase in net shipments of bauxite and alumina as well as an increase in average realized prices for flat rolled and engineered products 
the decrease in average realized prices for alumina was du e to a decrease in primary aluminum market prices to which kaiser s third party alumina sales contracts are linked 
the decrease in shipments of primary aluminum was primarily due to the complete curtailment of the northwest smelter s during the decrease in shipments of flat rolled products was primarily due to reduced shipments of can body stock as a part of the planned exit from this product line 
current period shipments for flat rolled products were also adversely affected by reduced general engineering heat treat products and can lid and tab stock due to weak market demand 
these decreases were only modestly offset by a strong aerospace demand during the first nine months of however  after the events of september   aerospace demand and the price for aerospace products declined substantially 
the decrease in engineered products shipments was the result of reduced transportation and electrical product shipments due to weak us market demand 
net sales for the year ended december   increased from the prior year primarily due to an increase in average realized prices 
the increase in average realized prices for alumina  which is sold under contracts at prices linked to the price of primary aluminum  and primary aluminum was a reflection of the increase in market prices for primary aluminum during the period 
averag e realized prices for flat rolled products increased due to a favorable change in product mix as a result of the exit from the can body stock product line  and net sales for engineered products reflected an increase in prices for soft allo y extrusions 
in addition to higher average realized prices  net sales were favorably impacted by higher shipments of primary aluminum due to an increase i n the operating rate for valco 
the improvement in net sales from these factors was partially offset by i lower shipments of alumina primarily due to the timing of shipments  ii lower shipments of flat rolled products due to kaiser s exit from the can body stock product line and iii lower shipments of engineered products due to a softening in the ground transportation and distribution markets 
operating income loss operating income loss for and includes non recurring income million and million  respectively 
these items as well as the non recurring items discussed below are described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding these items  operating income loss decreased from million for to million for in addition to the decrease in average realized prices and shipments discussed above  operating income for was adversely affected by abnormal gramercy related start up costs and litigation costs  overhead and other fixed costs associated with the curtailed northwest smelting operations  and increased cost s due to a lag in the ability to scale back costs to reflect a revised product mi x and the substantial volume decline caused by weakened demand 
operating income for the year ended december  included a net favorable impact from several non recurring items totaling million 
operating income for the year ended december  included a net unfavorabl e impact from non recurring items totaling million 
after excluding these items  operating income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in operating income  after excluding non recurring items  was primarily due to the improvements in net sales for alumina and primary aluminum discussed above 
higher energy costs  however  had an unfavorable impact on operating income for income loss before income taxes and minority interests income before income taxes and minority interests for the year ended december   includes the million gain on the sale of an interest in qal as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements as well as the net impact of certain non recurring amounts of million in addition to the million of non recurring items included in operating income as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income before income taxes and minority interests for the year ended december  included non recurring items totaling million in addition to the million in non recurring items included in operating income as discussed above 
after excluding these items  aluminum operations had a loss before income taxes and minority interests of million for the year ended december   as compared to a loss before income taxes and minority interests of million for the year ended december  the decline is a result of the decline in operating income discussed above 
the loss before income taxes and minority interests for the year ended december   included non recurring items totaling million in addition to the items included in operating income as discussed above 
after excluding these items as well as the non recurring items included in operating income which were discussed above  the aluminum operations had a loss before income taxes and minority interest of million in as compared to a los s of million in this improvement is due to the increase in operating income discussed above 
forest products operations industry overview this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see item business general and below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the company s forest products operations are conducted by mgi  through pacific lumber and britt 
the segment s business is somewhat seasonal  and its net sales have been historically higher in the months of april through november than in the months of december through march 
management expects that mgi s revenues and cash flows will continue to be somewhat seasonal 
accordingly  mgi s results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year 
regulatory and environmental matters play a significant role in the company s forest products operations 
see item business forest products operations regulatory and environmental matters and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these matters 
regulatory compliance and related litigation have caused delays in obtaining approvals of thps and delays in harvesting on thps once they are approved 
this has resulted in a decline in harvest  an increase in the cost of logging operations and lowe r net sales 
since the consummation of the headwaters agreement in march  there has been a significant amount of work required in connection with the implementation of the environmental plans  and this work is expected to continu e for several more years 
during the implementation period  government agencies had until recently failed to approve thps in a timely manner 
the rate of approvals of thps during improved over that for the prior year  and furthe r improvements have been experienced thus far in however  it continues to b e below levels which meet pacific lumber s expectations 
nevertheless  pacific lumber anticipates that once the environmental plans are fully implemented  the process of preparing thps will become more streamlined  and the time to obtain approval of thps will potentially be shortened 
while pacific lumber has experienced recent improvements in the thp approval process  there can be no assurance that pacific lumber will not in the future have difficulties in receiving approvals of its thps similar to those experienced in the past 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that certain pending legal  regulatory and environmental matters or future governmental regulations  legislation or judicial or administrative decisions  adverse weather conditions or low selling prices  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding regulatory and legal proceedings affecting the company s forest products operations 
during  comprehensive external and internal reviews were conducted o f pacific lumber s business operations 
these reviews were an effort to identify ways in which pacific lumber could operate on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
based upon the results of these reviews  pacific lumber  among other things  indefinitely idled two of its four sawmills  eliminated certain o f its operations  including its soil amendment and concrete block activities  began utilizing more efficient harvesting methods and adopted certain other cos t saving measures 
most of these changes were implemented by pacific lumber in th e last quarter of  or the first quarter of pacific lumber also ended its internal logging operations as of april   and intends to exclusively rely on third party contract loggers to conduct these activities in the future 
in connection with the changes described above  pacific lumber recognized a writedown of million for impaired assets  a million charge for restructuring initiatives  and a million charge for environmental remediation costs during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if business performance does not improve  additional restructuring charges may be necessary  and pacific lumber could have a significant liquidity issue

net sales net sales for the year ended december  were negatively impacted b y lower lumber prices  with lower prices for common grade redwood lumber being th e primary contributor to the decline 
in addition  shipments of lumber declined slightly versus the comparable prior year period 
the segment had higher sales volumes for redwood common grade lumber  however  this was more than offset by lower shipments of common grade douglas fir lumber 
net sales for the year ended december   increased over the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher prices for redwood lumber and higher shipments of common grade redwood and douglas fir lumber 
these improvements were offset in part by lower shipments of upper grade redwood lumber due to continuing reductions in the volume of old growth logs available for the production of lumber 
operating income loss the segment experienced an operating loss for the year ended december   compared to operating income for the same period of operating results for the year ended december   include the impact of several non recurring charges totaling million see note to the consolidated financial statements

with respect to mghi  maxxam parent does not expect to receive any dividends or distributions during maxxam parent owns  shares of the common stock of kaiser  representing a interest 
as a result of the cases  the value of kaiser common stock has declined since december   and the market value of the kaiser shares owned by maxxam parent based on the price per share quoted at the close of business on april   was million

with respect to the ots and fdic matters  although the ots director may change the administrative law judge s recommended decision  the company believe s that the ultimate resolution of the ots and fdic matters should not have a material adverse effect on maxxam parent s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the ots and fdic matters 
any adverse outcome of the other litigation or the regulatory and environmental matters described in note to the consolidated financial statements could materially adversely affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity

maxxam parent expects to pay mghi the amount of the intercompany note necessary to retire the mghi notes which are due in the regulatory and environmental matters described under results of operations forest products operations above have adversely affected cash available from subsidiaries  and therefore the distributions to mghi 
distributions from mghi s subsidiaries may continue to b e minimal  if any  over the next one to two years 
aluminum operations operating activities the increase in cash flows from operating activities between and resulted primarily from the impact of improved operating results  excludin g non cash items  driven primarily by power sales and a decline in gramercy related receivables 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities between and resulted primarily from the impact of the improved operating results  driven primarily by the power sales and a decline in inventories  offset in part by an increase in receivables 
the decrease in inventories was primarily due to improved inventory management and the exit fro m the can body product line at the flat rolled products business unit 
the increase in receivables was primarily due to power sale proceeds that were received in the first quarter of and gramercy related items 
capital expenditures total consolidated capital expenditures are expected to be between million and million per year in each of and of which approximately is expected to be funded by kaiser s minority partners in certain foreign joint ventures 
kaiser s management continues to evaluate numerous projects  all of which would require substantial capital  both in the united states and overseas 
the level of capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on kaiser s price outlook for primary aluminum and other products  kaiser s ability to assure future cash flows through hedging or other means  kaiser s financial position and other factors 
financial activities and liquidity on february   kaiser entered into the dip facility which provides for a secured  revolving line of credit through the earlier of february   the effective date of a plan of reorganization or voluntary termination b y kaiser 
kaiser is able to borrow under the dip facility by means of revolving credit advances and letters of credit up to million in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of million or a borrowing base relating to eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets reduced by certain reserves  as defined in the dip facility agreement 
the dip facility is guaranteed by kaiser and certain significant subsidiaries of kaiser interest on any outstanding balances will bear a spread over either a base rate or libor  at kaiser s option 
the court signed a final order approving of the dip facility on march  kaiser s management believes that the cash and cash equivalents of million at december   cash flows from operations and cash available fro m the dip facility will provide sufficient working capital to allow kaiser to mee t its obligations during the pendency of the cases 
at march   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and there were outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
as of march   million of which million could be used for additional letters of credit was available to kaiser under the dip facility 
kaiser expects that the borrowing base amount will increase by approximately million once certain appraisal information is provided to the lenders 
commitments and contingencies during the pendency of the cases  substantially all pending litigation  except that relating to certain environmental matters  against the debtors is stayed 
generally  claims arising from actions or omissions prior to the filing date will be settled in connection with the plan of reorganization 
kaiser is subject to a number of environmental laws  to fines or penaltie s assessed for alleged breaches of the environmental laws  and to claims and litigation based upon such laws 
based on kaiser s evaluation of these and othe r environmental matters  kaiser has established environmental accruals of million at december  however  kaiser believes that it is reasonably possible that changes in various factors could cause costs associated with thes e environmental matters to exceed current accruals by amounts that could range  i n the aggregate  up to an estimated million 
kaiser is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits that generally relate to products kaiser has not sold for more than years 
based on past experience and reasonably anticipated future activity  kaiser has established a million accrual at december   for estimated asbestos related costs for claims filed and estimated to be filed through  before consideration of insurance recoveries 
however  kaiser believes that substantial recoveries from insurance carriers are probable 
kaiser reached thi s conclusion based on prior insurance related recoveries in respect of asbestos related claims  existing insurance policies and the advice of outside counsel with respect to applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of these policies 
accordingly  kaiser has recorded an estimated aggregate insurance recovery of million determined on the same basis as the asbestos related cost accrual at december  although kaiser has settled asbestos related coverage matters with certain of its insurance carriers  other carriers have not yet agreed to settlements and disputes with certain carriers exist 
the timing and amount of future recoveries from these insurance carriers will depend on the pendency of the cases and on the resolution of disputes regarding coverage under the applicable insurance policies 
in connection with the uswa strike and subsequent lock out by kaiser whic h was settled in september  certain allegations of ulps have been filed with the nlrb by the uswa 
kaiser believes that all such allegations are without merit 
twenty two of twenty four allegations of ulps previously brought against kaiser by the uswa have been dismissed 
a trial before an administrative law judge for the two remaining allegations concluded in september a decision is not expected until sometime after the second quarter of any outcome from the trial before an administrative judge would be subject to additional appeals by the general counsel of the nlrb  the uswa or kaiser 
this matter is currently not stayed by the cases 
if these proceedings eventually resulted in a final ruling against kaiser with respect to either allegation  it could be obligated to provide back pay to uswa members at the five plants and such amoun t could be significant 
any liability ultimately determined to exist in this matter will be dealt with in the overall context of the debtors plan of reorganization 
while uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of these matters an d it is presently impossible to determine the actual costs that ultimately may be incurred and insurance recoveries that ultimately may be received  kaiser s management currently believes that the resolution of these uncertainties and th e incurrence of related costs  net of any related insurance recoveries  should no t have a material adverse effect on kaiser s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  amounts paid  if any  in satisfaction of these matters coul d be significant to the results of the period in which they are recorded 
see not e to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these contingencies and the factors affecting kaiser management s beliefs 
forest products operations substantially all of mgi s consolidated assets are owned by pacific lumber  and a significant portion of pacific lumber s consolidated assets are owned by scotia llc 
the holders of the timber notes have priority over the claims of creditors of pacific lumber with respect to the assets and cash flows of scotia llc 
in the event scotia llc s cash flows are not sufficient to generate distributable funds to pacific lumber  pacific lumber could effectivel y be precluded from distributing funds to mgi and mgi in turn to mghi 
on august   pacific lumber s revolving credit agreement the pacific lumber credit agreement was renewed 
the new facility provides for u p to a million two year revolving line of credit as compared to a million line of credit under the expired facility 
on each anniversary date  an d subject to the consent of the lender  the pacific lumber credit agreement may b e extended by one year 
the other terms and conditions are substantially the same as those under the expired facility 
borrowings  letters of credit and unused availability at december   are reflected in the table above 
scotia llc has an agreement with a group of banks which allows it to borrow up to one year s interest on the timber notes the scotia llc line of credit 
on june   this facility was extended for an additional year to july  annually  scotia llc will request that the scotia llc line of credit be extended for a period of not less than days 
if not extended  scotia llc may draw upon the full amount available 
the amount drawn would be repayable in semiannual installments on each note payment date after the payment of certain other items  including the aggregate minimum principal amortization amount  as defined  then due  commencing approximately two and one half years following the date of the draw 
on march   scotia llc notified the trustee for the timber notes that it had met all of the requirements of the sar reduction date  as defined i n the indenture 
accordingly  on march   scotia llc released millio n from the sar account and distributed this amount to pacific lumber 
during the year ended december   scotia llc used million se t aside in the note payment account to pay the million of interest due as well as million of principal 
scotia llc repaid an additional million of principal on the timber notes using funds held in the sar account  resulting in total principal payments of million  an amount equal to scheduled amortization 
in addition  scotia llc made distributions in the amount of million to its parent  pacific lumber  million of which was made using funds from the december sale of the owl creek grove and million of which was made using excess funds released from the sar account 
on the note payment date in january  scotia llc had million se t aside in the note payment account to pay the million of interest due as well as million of principal 
scotia llc repaid an additional million of principal on the timber notes using funds held in the sar account  resulting in a total principal payment of million  an amount equal to scheduled amortization as defined in the indenture 
with respect to the note payment due in july  scotia llc expects tha t it will require funds from the scotia llc line of credit to pay a portion of th e interest due and that all of the funds used to pay the scheduled amortization amount will be provided from the sar account 
capital expenditures were made during the past three years to improve production efficiency  reduce operating costs and acquire additional timberlands 
capital expenditures  excluding expenditures for timberlands and real estate  are estimated to be between million and million per year for the period 
pacific lumber and scotia llc may purchase additional timberlands from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise 
due to its highly leveraged condition  mgi is more sensitive than less leveraged companies to factors affecting its operations  including governmental regulation and litigation affecting its timber harvesting practices see results of operations forest products operations above and note to the consolidated financial statements  increased competition from other lumber producers or alternative building products and general economic conditions 
pacific lumber s cash flows from operations were adversely affected by operating inefficiencies  lower lumber prices  an inadequate supply of logs and a related slowdown in lumber production 
during  comprehensive externa l and internal reviews were conducted of pacific lumber s business operations 
these reviews were an effort to identify ways in which pacific lumber could operate on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
based upon the results of these reviews  pacific lumber has  among other things  indefinitely curtailed two of its four operating sawmills  eliminated certain of its operations  including its soil amendment and concrete block manufacturing operations  begun utilizing more efficient harvesting methods and adopted certain other cost saving measures 
most of these operational changes were implemented by pacific lumber during the last quarter of  or during the first quarter of pacific lumber also terminated its internal logging operations as of april   and intends to rely on third party contract loggers to conduct these activities 
the adverse resulting impact on liquidity of its poor operating results was offset by million in distributions made by scotia llc to pacific lumber principally from the sale of the owl creek grove  million in repayments on an intercompany loan by mgi  and million of proceeds received from the sale of a portion of the grizzly creek grove 
the million release from the sar account discussed above will also improve pacific lumber s liquidity 
however  pacific lumber may require funds available under the pacific lumber credit agreement  additional repayments by mgi of an intercompany loan and or capital contributions from mgi to enable it to meet it s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next year 
with respect to long term liquidity  although mgi and its subsidiaries expect that their existing cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and ability to generate cash flows from operations should provide sufficient funds to meet their debt service  working capital and capital expenditure requirements  until such time as pacific lumber has adequate cash flows from operations and o r dividends from scotia llc  there can be no assurance that this will be the case real estate operations in june  lakepointe assets purchased lake pointe plaza  an office complex located in sugar land  texas  for a purchase price of million 
the transaction was financed with proceeds of million  net of million in deferred financing costs  from the lakepointe notes million principal amount with a final maturity date of june   and an interest rate of  and with a cash payment of million 
lakepointe assets acquired the property subject to two leases to existing tenants while simultaneously leasing a majority of the premises  representing all of the remaining space  to an affiliate of the seller 
the office complex is fully leased for a period of years under these three leases 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in the company expects that these expenditures will be funded by existing cash and available credit facilities 
pdmpi and its subsidiaries have required advances during to fund their operations 
although pdmpi may require such advances in the future  the company believes that the existing cash and credit facilities of its real estat e subsidiaries are sufficient to fund the working capital and capital expenditure requirements of such subsidiaries for the next year 
with respect to the long term liquidity of such subsidiaries  the company believes that their ability to generate cash from the sale of their existing real estate  together with their ability to obtain financing and joint venture partners should provid e sufficient funds to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
racing operations capital expenditures and investments in new ventures are expected to be approximately million in with respect to long term liquidity  shrp  ltd expects that it will generate cash flows from operations sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
critical accounting policies this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see item business general and below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that ar e not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular  ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following accounting policies are considered critical in light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on the company s reporte d financial information 
principles of consolidation kaiser under generally accepted accounting principles  consolidation is generall y required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these rules  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the investor 
at december   the conditions that represent limitations to consolidation described above did not exist with respect to the company s investment in kaiser 
the company exercised control over kaiser  and any possible loss of control in the near term was not deemed to be the result of a probable occurrence of events that were outside the company s control  since kaiser s decision to file for bankruptcy was made on a voluntary basis 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   include the accounts of kaiser 
due to the filing  effective february   the company will no longer consolidate kaiser s financial results in its consolidated financial statements  and will report its investmen t in kaiser under the cost method 
when and if kaiser emerges from bankruptcy  th e subsequent accounting will be determined based on the applicable circumstances and facts at such time  including the terms of any plan of reorganization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of kaiser s reorganization proceedings 
loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses to the company that will ultimately be realized when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to income estimated losses from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments  and other factors 
risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome of litigation 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company recorded charges of million in to write down the carrying amount of certain buildings  machinery and equipment to estimated fair value see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company review s noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated if the expected total undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upon impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down for impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the nee d for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
in some instances  situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes i n economic conditions or other factors that develop over time 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   the company had million of net deferred ta x assets 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported in the company s balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company has prepaid or received a tax benefit for an asset or will have to pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that result from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibility between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code 
accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood o f more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
the need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income necessary to receive the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity 
projections of future taxable income  by their very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  although they might be predictable  are far less certain than events that have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of the company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans as of december   the company had million in accrued liabilities related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the company estimates its liability under these benefit plans based on an actuarial analysis 
the actuarial analysis is based on certain assumptions about the expected future return on plan assets  the expected rate of compensation increase and the discount rate 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk kaiser s operating results are sensitive to changes in the prices of alumina  primary aluminum  and fabricated aluminum products  and also depend to a significant degree upon the volume and mix of all products sold 
as discussed more fully in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  kaiser utilizes hedging transactions to lock in a specified price or range of prices for certain products which it sells or consumes in its production process and t o mitigate kaiser s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity alumina and primary aluminum alumina and primary aluminum production in excess of internal requirement s is sold in domestic and international markets  exposing kaiser to commodity price opportunities and risks 
kaiser s hedging transactions are intended to provide price risk management in respect of the net exposure of earnings resulting from i anticipated sales of alumina  primary aluminum and fabricate d aluminum products  less ii expected purchases of certain items  such as aluminum scrap  rolling ingot  and bauxite  whose prices fluctuate with the price of primary aluminum 
on average  before consideration of hedging activities  any fixed price contracts with fabricated aluminum products customers  variations in production and shipment levels  and timing issues related to price changes  kaiser estimates that each 
increase decrease i n the market price per price equivalent pound of primary aluminum increases decreases kaiser s annual pre tax earnings by approximately million  based on recent fluctuations in operating levels 
foreign currency kaiser enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge material cash commitments for foreign currencies 
kaiser s primary foreign exchange exposure is related to kaiser s australian dollar a commitments in respect of activities associated with its owned affiliate  qal 
kaiser estimates that  before consideration of any hedging activities  a us increase decrease in the value of the a results in an approximate million decrease increase in kaiser s annual pre tax operating income 
energy kaiser is exposed to energy price risk from fluctuating prices for natura l gas  fuel oil and diesel oil consumed in the production process 
kaiser estimates that each change in natural gas prices per mcf impacts kaiser s pre tax operating results by approximately million 
further  kaiser estimates that each change in fuel oil prices per barrel impacts kaiser s pre tax operating results by approximately million
