all forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
we are one of the leading worldwide independent providers of turnkey manufacturing services to electronics oems in the networking  telecommunications  computing and storage  instrumentation and medical  computer  peripherals  automotive and consumer products industries 
while operating income and net income decreased in fiscal years and  we have historically experienced substantial growth in net revenue  operating income and net income 
this growth  as well as the historical growth of the overall ems industry  which subsided in early to mid  has been driven by the increasing number of electronics oems who are outsourcing their manufacturing requirements 
we anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years 
we derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from oem customers 
we recognize revenue  net of product returns  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers inventory management  new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes  and consolidations among our customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 

table of contents our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of a component based on the costs of materials in that product and a component based on the labor and manufacturing overhead allocation to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor costs and manufacturing overhead for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor and selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years  through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in research and development of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these research and development activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated financial statements 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
we hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts  the amount and cost of which have not been material 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are included in other comprehensive income 
see note p summary of significant accounting policies comprehensive income to the consolidated financial statements 
we continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us  and other customers have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents acquisitions and expansion during fiscal  we made an acquisition that was accounted for as a pooling of interests and our consolidated financials statements have been restated to reflect the combined operations of the merged companies for all periods presented 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
we have also made a number of other acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition 
for further discussion of our acquisitions  see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased certain operations of lucent technologies of shanghai ltos in shanghai  china 
we acquired these operations in an effort to enhance our competencies in complex optical assembly and design services  to broaden our base of manufacturing for the communications industry in asia and to strengthen our relationship with lucent technologies lucent 
simultaneous with the purchase  we entered into a three year supply agreement with lucent to manufacture optical switching and other communications infrastructure products 
the transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
total consideration paid was approximately million in cash 
funding for this acquisition was provided by current working capital 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased certain operations of seagate technology reynosa  s

we acquired these operations to expand our repair presence in the data storage market and to add a low cost service site in latin america 
simultaneous with the purchase  our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a two year agreement to provide repair and warranty services for seagate s personal storage and enterprise storage hard disk drives 
the transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
total consideration paid was approximately million in cash 
funding for this acquisition was provided by current working capital 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased certain operations of philips electronics philips in austria  brazil  china  hungary  poland and singapore 
we expect to complete the purchase of three remaining sites by the end of january we acquired these operations to broaden our base in the consumer electronics industry  to expand our global footprint and to strengthen our relationship with philips 
simultaneous with the purchase  we entered into a four year agreement with philips to provide design and engineering services  new product introduction  prototype and test services  procurement and manufacture of a wide range of consumer products 
the transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
total consideration paid was approximately million in cash 
funding for this acquisition was provided by current working capital 
while management currently anticipates that the remaining portions of the transaction will close by the end of january  there is no assurance that we will ultimately consummate the remaining portions of the acquisition 
on september   we announced that we had entered into an agreement with quantum corporation quantum to purchase certain operations in penang  malaysia 
consummation of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions  including government approval 
we intend to acquire these operations in an effort to broaden our base of manufacturing for the computing and storage sector in asia and to further strengthen our relationship with quantum 
while management currently anticipates that the transaction will close in the first half of fiscal  there is no assurance that we will ultimately consummate the acquisition 
during fiscal year  we continued construction of our greenfield expansion in guangzhou  china  which is expected to be completed during fiscal 
table of contents see factors affecting future results we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customer s product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy 
we have recorded intangible assets including goodwill based on third party valuations  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  which we early adopted effective september   we completed the transitional impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of adoption 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy 
we recognized restructuring charges in fiscal and related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
the 
table of contents recognition of restructuring charges required that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of net revenue years ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development amortization of intangibles acquisitions and merger related charges restructuring and other charges operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue decreased to billion for fiscal year  down from billion in fiscal year the decrease was due to a decrease in production of computing and storage products  a decrease in production of peripheral products and a decrease in production of networking products due to softening demand in those sectors 
these decreases were offset in part by and increases in production of instrumentation and medical and consumer products  respectively  due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in those sectors 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of revenue for fiscal the increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in england  france  italy  malaysia and scotland 
the percentage of foreign source revenue also increased as a result of the current economic conditions in the us as our overall revenue has fallen  our us based revenues have decreased proportionally more than the decreases in the asian  latin american and european markets 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and due to cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities during the last six quarters 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in 
table of contents fiscal year this dollar increase was attributable to locations acquired in late fiscal and fiscal and to a full year s operations in facilities that were under construction or starting production during fiscal the increase as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by the increase in absolute dollars as well as by decreased revenues in fiscal year research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year but remained at of net revenue for each of the years ended august  and  respectively 
despite the recent economic conditions that negatively impacted the demand for our services  we continue to engage in research and development activities  including design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process  development of new products and new failure analysis techniques at our historical levels 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was attributable to the amortization of amortizable intangible assets arising from our acquisitions in england and italy during late fiscal and in france  malaysia  scotland and the united states during fiscal we elected to early adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  effective the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill for fiscal for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion above  note f intangible assets  note intangible assets and note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and merger related charges 
during fiscal year  we incurred million in acquisition related charges consisting of increased incremental staffing and support costs and legal and professional fees associated with the acquisitions in france  malaysia  scotland and the united states 
see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other charges 
during fiscal  we incurred million in restructuring charges related to reductions in our cost structure 
these charges included reductions in workforce  re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
these charges were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand 
approximately million related to asset write off costs  million to lease exit costs  million to employee severance and termination benefit costs and million in other restructuring costs 
as of august   total liabilities of million related to these restructuring activities are expected to be paid out within the next twelve months 
the employee severance and benefit termination costs included in our restructuring charges are related to the elimination of approximately  employees during fiscal the majority of these employees were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in various facilities around the world 
costs related to lease commitments consist primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated as a result of the consolidation of facilities 
the fixed asset impairment charge primarily results from a decision made to vacate several smaller facilities in the united states  europe and asia due to current macroeconomic conditions 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  see note restructuring to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently expect to incur approximately million to million in additional restructuring charges during fiscal related to the closure of our boise  idaho plant and certain other restructuring activities  which are being evaluated in light of the current macroeconomic conditions 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year reflecting increased income on greater cash balances resulting from positive cash flow from operations during fiscal and the proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes completed in the third quarter of fiscal see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of our issuance of convertible notes near the end of the third quarter of fiscal and imputed interest on deferred acquisition payments related to the marconi acquisition 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our effective tax rate decreased to from in fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of domestic versus international income from operations 
as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased  our effective tax rate has decreased as our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in malaysia  china and hungary that expire through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
in addition to the increase in foreign source income  the effective tax rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal decreased due to the mix of the effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which our restructuring and acquisition related charges were incurred and the tax treatment of the amortization of intangibles in each jurisdiction 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was due to a increase in production of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in production of consumer products  a increase in production of telecommunications products  a increase in production of networking products  and a increase in production of automotive products 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of revenue for fiscal the increase in foreign source revenue was attributable to increased production in our international locations  primarily in our mexican  malaysian and hungarian facilities  and from incremental revenue resulting from the marconi acquisitions in england and italy during the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year reflecting a higher content of material based revenue as well as relatively lower levels of capacity utilization than in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increases in staffing and related departmental expenses at all of our locations along with increases in information systems staff to support the expansion of our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue in fiscal year as a result of the establishment of a new design center located in our michigan facility as well as expanded services in other locations 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase is attributable to the amortization of the goodwill arising from the marconi acquisition during fiscal acquisition and merger related charge

interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year reflecting increased income on greater cash balances resulting from the issuance of convertible notes completed in the third quarter of fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of decreased short term borrowings under our revolving line of credit throughout the year  offset by additional expense accrued on the convertible notes issued in the third quarter of fiscal income taxes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at august   we had cash and cash equivalents balances totaling million  total notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations of million and million available for borrowings under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted of million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization  million from decreases in accounts receivable  million from decreases of inventory  million from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million of non cash restructuring charges 
the decrease in inventory was due to reduced levels of business during fiscal consistent with the last half of fiscal  we continued to experience reduced levels of demand from many of our customers in response to the general economic downturn 
inventory levels were decreased in line with new levels of expected demand 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to the decreased revenue during fiscal  accompanied by improved collections of outstanding balances 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was a result of an increased emphasis on cash management as well as the timing of purchases near year end 
net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal consisted of our capital expenditures of million for construction and equipment worldwide and cash paid of million in the acquisition of businesses  net of million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
consistent with the reduced levels of demand we experienced during fiscal  our capital expenditures were significantly lower in fiscal compared to fiscal we also continued construction of a new manufacturing facility in guangzhou  china to support expected future capacity needs in this low cost region 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal resulted primarily from million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  offset by the repayment of an installment of principal on our private placement debt 
see note notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations and note stockholders equity to the consolidated financial statements 
we may need to finance future growth and any corresponding working capital needs with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we filed a shelf registration statement registering the potential sale of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
in august  we effectively increased the amount of unissued securities under our shelf registration statement from million to billion 
in may  we issued a total of million  year  convertible subordinated notes at par  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the notes mature on may  and pay interest semiannually on may and november each note is convertible at any time after the date of original issuance and prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date by the holder at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on may in the years   and at par plus accrued interest 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or common stock valued at of its market price 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after may  at of principal plus accrued interest 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
these offerings were made pursuant to that registration statement 
in august  we established a million account receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks with an expiration date in august  which was later extended to november we renewed the facility with a new funding capacity of million in november and again in may the facility expires in may there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at august  interest is payable based on designated commercial paper rates plus agreed upon margins 
we have a committed line of credit facility in place with a syndicate of banks that provides up to million of working capital borrowing capacity  which expires april  there were no 
table of contents borrowings outstanding under the facility at august  we allowed an additional million day credit facility to expire in may  given our current cash balance  our existing credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization program 
we expect to renew our credit facilities during the first quarter of fiscal our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations 
it is possible that future acquisitions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
for example  we have entered into a number of transactions in which we acquired or will acquire oem facilities for cash during the first half of fiscal see acquisitions and expansion 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory  the timing of expenditures for new equipment  levels of shipments and changes in volumes of customer orders 
we believe that during fiscal year  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  will be approximately million  principally for machinery  equipment  facilities and related expenses 
we believe that our level of resources  which includes cash on hand  available borrowings  and funds provided by operations  will be more than adequate to fund these expenditures  the expected cash needed for announced acquisitions and working capital requirements for fiscal consummating any significant amount of additional acquisition opportunities  which we regularly explore  would increase our capital needs and  possibly  result in our need to increase our borrowings and to access public and private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity with terms that we consider acceptable 
see factors affecting future results we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
our contractual obligations for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and short and long term debt arrangements as of august  are summarized below 
we do not participate in  or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities 
non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the notes payable and long term debt require compliance with a financial covenant based on the ratio of total debt to total capitalization  calculated on a consolidated basis 
in addition  they require compliance with operating covenants  which limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants as of august  
table of contents factors affecting future results our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including adverse changes in general economic conditions the level and timing of customer orders the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs the composition of the costs of revenue between materials  labor and manufacturing overhead price competition our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product the degree of automation used in our assembly process the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers inventory management  new product introductions and manufacturing strategy changes  and consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quarterly results 
because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   our four largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and customers accounted for over of our net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   cisco systems  inc and marconi communications  accounted for approximately and of our net revenue  respectively 
we are dependent upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of our customers whose industries have experienced rapid technological change  short product life cycles  consolidation  and pricing and margin pressures 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
if they do  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business customers and marketing 

table of contents our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change 
our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
these conditions frequently result in short product life cycles 
our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
if technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on the electronics industry  which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business 
factors affecting the electronics industry in general could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards  which result in short product life cycles  the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested  the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance  and recessionary periods in our customers markets 
if any of these factors materialize  our business would suffer 
in addition  if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing service to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from our ability to offer complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net sales may significantly decline 
most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity 
the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products our customers attempts to manage their inventory electronic design changes changes in our customers manufacturing strategy acquisitions of or consolidations among customers recessionary conditions in customers industries due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
anticipated orders from many of our customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
on other occasions  our customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience such effects in the future 
in addition  the current business environment resulting from uncertainties relating to terrorist activities and economic recession has made planning even more complex 
a business 
table of contents downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
electronics manufacturing service providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
the success of our customers products in the market affects our business 
cancellations  reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimate of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross margins and operating results 
we compete with numerous providers of electronic manufacturing services  including our current or potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally 
the electronic manufacturing services business is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  including celestica  inc  flextronics international  sanmina sci corporation and solectron corporation 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  electronic manufacturing services 
most of our competitors have international operations and some have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development  and marketing resources than us 
we also face potential competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of outsourcing 
see business competition 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidation in the electronics manufacturing services industry results in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  research and development  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence  be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  
table of contents devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services  and be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
as a result  competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  profit margin compression  or loss of market share 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our profitability could decline 
we have grown rapidly 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  motivate and manage our employees 
our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see selected consolidated financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any delay in integrating our new information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs 
we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in sixteen of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location 
we are in the process of installing this system in our remaining plants  which will replace the current manufacturing resource planning system  and financial information systems 
any delay in the implementation of these new information systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost 
we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions  and possible adverse tax and accounting effects 
operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  and unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations 
we have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from oem s 
in these acquisitions  the divesting oem will typically enter a supply arrangement with the acquiror 
therefore  the competition for these acquisitions is intense 
in addition  certain oem s may not choose to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current 
table of contents supply arrangements with other oem s 
if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities  our growth could be adversely impacted 
our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks  including our ability to meet volume  product quality  timeliness and pricing requirements  and our ability to achieve the oem s expected cost reduction 
in addition  when acquiring manufacturing operations  we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules 
accordingly  in these circumstances  we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues 
we may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements 
as a result of these and other risks  these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits 
substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or  if such re pricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred  particularly of memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business components procurement 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which are subject to greater volatility and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
we derived over of our revenues from international operations in fiscal year we currently operate outside the united states in brussels  belgium  contagem  brazil  panyu  china  coventry  england  brest and meung sur loire  france  tiszaujvaros  hungary  dublin  ireland  bergamo and marcianise  italy  penang  malaysia  chihuahua and guadalajara  mexico and ayr and livingston  scotland 
we continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic instability unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll  utility and other expenses 
table of contents inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations to reduce our us income taxes in addition  several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire  retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel  maintain technological leadership  develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment  which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel  the loss of which could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends largely on the efforts and skills of our key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not have employment agreements or non competition agreements with our key employees 
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 

table of contents certain of our existing stockholders have significant control 
our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders  and their affiliates collectively beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  of which william d 
morean  our chairman of the board  beneficially owns 
as a result  our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and the affairs and policies of jabil 
our stock price may be volatile due to factors beyond our control 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors  government regulations  litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  or general conditions in the contract manufacturing  networking  telecommunications  computing and storage  instrumentation and medical  computer  peripherals  automotive and consumer products industries 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law may discourage certain takeover transactions 
the corporation law of the state of delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain certain provisions that may  in effect  discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of jabil or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place 
during fiscal year  we adopted a stockholder rights agreement  which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire jabil in a transaction that our board of directors opposes 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock  or could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities 
our tax position  however  is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law 
we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes 
several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted  or if they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
in addition  further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase 
we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and hedging operations 
a portion of our business is conducted in the chinese renminbi  the euro  the mexican peso and the brazilian real 
in recent years  the brazilian real and the mexican peso have experienced significant devaluations 
changes in exchange rates between these and other currencies and the us dollar will affect our cost of sales  operating margins and revenues 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations 
we use financial instruments  primarily forward purchase contracts  to hedge us dollar and other foreign currency commitments arising from trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations 

table of contents because we hedge only fixed obligations  we do not expect that these hedging activities will harm our results of operations or cash flows 
our hedging activities  however  may be unsuccessful  and we may change or reduce our hedging activities in the future 
as a result  we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates 
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
as of august   we did not have outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we also have funding costs associated with the asset backed securitization 
costs are  in part  based on commercial paper rates 
as of august   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the asset backed securitization 
an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rate is determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in various foreign countries and enter into foreign currency contracts  specifically forward contracts to hedge transactional exposure 
transactional exposure primarily consists of vendor payments  payroll and local expenses 
we adopted fas no 
 as amended by fas and  and as such  all foreign currency forward contracts are reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
as of august   we had no outstanding forward contracts 
forward contracts generally expire in less than a month and settle in euro  british pounds  mexican peso and japanese yen 
interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities and by constantly positioning the portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of august   the outstanding amount in the investment portfolio was million  comprised mainly of money market funds with an average return of
