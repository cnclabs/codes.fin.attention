based on current operations  management believes that cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements only until approximately the end of the second quarter of fiscal year in view of current operations and cash on hand  we will need to take one or more of the following actions in the very near term in order to continue our operations i significantly reduce operating expenses  ii raise additional capital  iii discontinue certain operations  or iv sell some or all of our assets 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in taking any of these actions in the near future to meet our liquidity requirements 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of july  in millions payments due by fiscal year total long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company derives revenue from three primary sources  content  certification and services 
content revenue is derived from the sale of books or licensing of our training materials for reproduction or repurposing  or under oem arrangements 
content revenue is recognized when the products are shipped 
certification revenue includes testing fees from administration of our certification tests and annual fees received from ciw authorized training providers ciw atp 
testing fees are recognized when the tests are administered and ciw atp fees are recognized when the funds are received or  if the company has an obligation for continuing involvement with the ciw atp  revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
services revenue includes training and consulting services and is recognized when the services are provided 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
additional factors that may affect future results of operations and market price of stock the discussions in this form k concerning future financing needs  changes in business strategy  future profitability and factors affecting liquidity contain forward looking statements 
although management believes that these statements are reasonable in view of the facts available to it  no assurance can be given that all of these statements will prove to be accurate 
numerous factors could have a material effect upon whether these projections could be realized or whether these trends will continue 
among these factors are those set forth in the following section  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
risk to continued operation we are operating with very limited cash resources 
we cannot maintain our current level of operating losses and remain a continuing operation given our current cash on hand 
we must drastically reduce our operating losses in the near term  obtain additional funds  or do both to remain in operation 
we could reduce operating losses by significantly reducing our operations and staff  provided such actions do not cause revenue to decline greater than we expect as a result of such actions 
we could obtain additional funds by raising additional capital or selling some or all of our assets or operations 
the sale of some or all of our assets is subject to approval by the holder of our long term debt  since those assets secure that debt 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in taking any of these actions nor that these actions will result in the company continuing its operations 
in the event we choose to obtain additional funding there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the company s board of directors engaged an investment banker in july to explore strategic options for the company  including a sale of some or all of its assets and operations 
we have been involved in a number of discussions as the result of this engagement that could result in the sale of some or all of our assets or operations 
through november th  we will be negotiating exclusively with one party to determine if an acceptable offer for the sale of some or all of the company s assets will be received from that party 
there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in an offer for some or all of the company s assets or operations  nor that in the event we receive an acceptable offer we will be able to close a transaction in sufficient time to allow us to continue operations 
since a reduction in operations and staff sufficient to continue operations would likely result in the impairment or abandonment of some assets and operations that might have value in a sale  we have postponed making reductions pending the conclusion of active discussions 
however  this postponement of a reduction in operations and staff has contributed and will continue to contribute to our continuing operating losses and deteriorating cash position 
possibility of continuing losses we have incurred net losses of approximately million from our inception through july  our ability to generate revenue growth in the future is subject to uncertainty 
in order to achieve profitability  we must increase our revenues and significantly reduce operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues  manage expenses  or achieve profitability 

table of contents uncertainty of future funding should we need to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain them on terms satisfactory to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds on terms satisfactory to us we will be forced to either raise funds on terms that we would not otherwise accept or pursue the alternatives noted under risk to continued operation 
intense competition in training market we face substantial competition in the training market 
competition in the ict training market is intense  rapidly changing and affected by the rapidly evolving nature of the information technology industry 
a number of other companies offer products and services similar to ours  and additional new competitors may emerge in the future 
many of our existing competitors have substantially greater capital resources  technical expertise  marketing experience  research and development status  established customers and facilities than we do 
as a result  there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully compete with existing and future competitors  which would adversely affect our financial performance 
need to respond to rapid technological changes in our industry  technology advances rapidly and industry standards change frequently 
to remain competitive and return to profitability  we must continually enhance our existing products and services and promptly introduce new products  services  and technologies to meet the changing demands of our customers 
our failure to respond to technological changes quickly would adversely affect our financial performance 
effect of market overhang on stock price future sales of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the perception that such sales will occur could also adversely affect the price 
as long as certain registration statements which have been filed with the sec remain effective  the selling stockholders under those registration statements may sell approximately million shares  or approximately percent of the shares of common stock currently outstanding on a diluted basis 
these shares were privately issued and are otherwise subject to restrictions on resale under securities laws 
any such sales  or even the market perception that such sales could be made  may depress the price of the common stock 
the majority of the shares registered are already saleable under rule volatility of stock price our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  which may continue to occur in the future 
additionally  the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition to such broad market fluctuations  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock fluctuations in our operating results the perception by others of our ability to obtain any necessary new financing the limited trading market for our common stock announcements of new ventures or products and services by us or our competitors item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have risk related to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a portion of our cash flows is expected to be received in non us currencies
