overview pain therapeutics  inc is developing a new generation of opioid painkillers with improved clinical benefits 
we believe our drugs will offer enhanced pain relief and reduced tolerance physical dependence or addiction potential compared to existing opioid painkillers 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
our management relies on arrangements with universities  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
we currently have four opioid painkillers in various stages of phase ii clinical trials  including our two lead product candidates  morviva tm and oxytrex tm  and two other product candidates  pti and pti morviva tm is the brand name for our product previously known as pti injectible version and pti oral version which we are developing to treat patients with severe pain 
oxytrex tm is the brand name for our product previously known as pti which we are developing to treat patients with moderate to severe pain in a chronic setting 
pti is the next generation version of hydrocodone  which we are developing to treat patients with acute moderate to severe pain 
pti is the next generation version of tramadol  which we are developing to treat patients with moderate pain in an acute setting 
based on the results of multiple phase i and phase ii studies completed for morviva tm and two pharmacokinetic and safety studies completed for oxytrex tm  we are designing and conducting clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these two drug candidates in different clinical settings of pain 
we are currently developing pti and pti on a very limited basis in order to focus our financial resources on morviva tm and oxytrex tm 
no significant trials are planned in the near future using pti or pti we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
we have not been profitable and  since our inception  we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million through december  these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  including costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our product candidates  salaries and other personnel related costs  including the amortization of deferred compensation associated with options granted to employees and non employees  and general corporate expenses 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our product candidates  our need for clinical supplies  as well as the re measurement of certain deferred stock compensation 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the next several years 
we also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drugs  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our product candidates 
in the event that our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our products and or  if we license our products to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from licensed products 
sources of revenue for the foreseeable future may also include payments from potential collaborative arrangements  including license fees  funded research payments  milestone payments and royalties based on revenues received from products commercialized under such arrangements 
critical accounting policies we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to financial statements  the policies regarding research and development costs and non cash stock based compensation are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of drug development work associated with our product candidates  primarily including costs of preclinical and clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  research payments to the albert einstein college of medicine and salaries and other personnel related expenses including non cash stock based compensation 
research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly over the next several years as our development efforts are expanded and our product candidates enter into various stages of clinical trials  and may vary significantly from period to period due to the timing of these activities 
there will also continue to be future non cash charges included in research and development expenses for stock based compensation related to options granted to employees and consultants 
non cash stock based compensation deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
deferred compensation for non employees is recorded at the fair value of the options granted in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and is periodically re measured until the underlying options vest in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the model considers a number of factors  including the market price and expected volatility of our common stock at the date of measurement or re measurement 
the compensation expense related to all grants is amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin the amount of compensation expense we record could fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a the periodic re measurement of deferred stock compensation for non employees principally as a result of fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  b the amount of additional options granted to non employees and c the method by which deferred stock compensation is amortized as charges to operations 
results of operations years ended december  and agreement with albert einstein college of medicine in may  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with albert einstein college of medicine for all patents and pending patent applications relating to low dose opioid antagonist technology 
our license rights terminate upon the expiration of the patents used to protect the technology  which are scheduled to expire no earlier than september pursuant to the terms of the license agreement  in we paid albert einstein college of medicine a one time licensing fee  which was recognized as license fee expense in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as this technology has no alternative future use 
in addition  we have paid albert einstein college of medicine research payments that have been recognized as research and development expense 
we are also required to make milestone payments to albert einstein college of medicine upon the achievement of certain regulatory and clinical events 
in the aggregate these success based milestones may total up to million including amounts due upon receipt of our first drug approval in the us and in specified foreign countries 
we must pay albert einstein college of medicine royalties based on a percentage of net sales of our products 
if a product is combined with a drug or other substance for which we are paying an additional royalty  the royalty rate we pay to albert einstein college of medicine will be reduced by one half of the amount of such additional royalty 
research and development years ended december  research and development non cash stock based compensation   other research and development expense   total research and development expense   research and development expense consists of non cash stock based compensation as described below and other research and development expense 
other research and development expense consists of drug development work associated with our product candidates  primarily including costs of preclinical  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  research payments to the albert einstein college of medicine and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
other research and development expense was million in the period compared to million in the period 
the period to period increase of million was primarily due to increases in preclinical and clinical development activities  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  salaries and other personnel related costs associated with increases in staff to support these activities 
other research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly over the next several years as our development efforts are expanded and our product candidates enter into various stages of clinical trials  and may vary from period to period due to the timing of these activities 
general and administrative years ended december  general and administrative non cash stock based compensation   other general and administrative expense   total general and administrative expense   general and administrative expense consists of non cash stock based compensation as described below and other general and administrative expense 
other general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses to support our activities  consulting and professional services expenses  facilities expenses and other general corporate expenses 
other general and administrative expenses were million in the period compared to million in the period 
the period to period increase of million was primarily due to increases in salaries and other personnel related costs associated with increased staffing  consulting and professional services expenses and other general corporate expenses 
non cash stock based compensation deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
deferred compensation for non employees is recorded at the fair value of the options granted in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and is periodically re measured until the underlying options vest in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the model considers a number of factors  including the market price and expected volatility of our common stock at the date of measurement or re measurement 
the compensation expense related to all grants is amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options in accordance with fin the amount of compensation expense we record could fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a the periodic re measurement of deferred stock compensation for non employees principally as a result of fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  b the amount of additional options granted to non employees and c the method by which deferred stock compensation is amortized as charges to operations 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees as well as the re measurement of deferred stock compensation for grants of stock options to non employees  we recorded a decrease in deferred compensation on the balance sheet of million for the period ended december  compared to an increase of million for the period ended december  these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity deficit and are being amortized as charges to operations 
we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense for options granted as well as restricted stock purchase agreements as components of both research and development expense and general and administrative expense totaling million and million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was principally the result of the lower market price of our common stock at the end of as compared to  the amortization methodology utilized in accordance with fin and the inclusion of million of compensation expense related to restricted stock purchase agreements in the period 
there will also continue to be future non cash charges for the amortization of deferred compensation related to options granted to employees and consultants 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents principally as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in july  partially offset by declining interest rates in the period 
return to series c preferred stockholders for beneficial conversion feature in february we issued  shares of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock for million  net of issuance costs 
we determined that our series c preferred stock was issued with a beneficial conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion feature has been recognized by allocating a portion of the preferred stock proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature  limited to the net proceeds received million  to additional paid in capital 
the intrinsic value is calculated at the date of issue as the difference between the conversion price of the preferred stock and the fair value of our common stock  into which the preferred stock is convertible  multiplied by the number of common shares into which the preferred stock is convertible  limited to the net proceeds received 
as our series c preferred stock was convertible into common stock at the option of the holder  at the issuance date of the preferred stock the entire million discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature has been treated as a dividend and recognized as a return to the preferred stockholders for purposes of computing basic and diluted loss per share in the period ended december  upon completion of our initial public offering in july  all of our convertible preferred and redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into common stock on a one to one basis 
years ended december  and research and development years ended december  research and development non cash stock based compensation   other research and development expense   total research and development expense   research and development expense consists of non cash stock based compensation as described below and other research and development expense 
other research and development expenses were million in the period compared to million in the period 
the increase of million was primarily due to increases in clinical development activities for our product candidates and increases in salaries and other personnel related costs associated with increasing staffing in support of these activities 
general and administrative years ended december  general and administrative non cash stock based compensation   other general and administrative expense   total general and administrative expense   general and administrative expense consists of non cash stock based compensation as described below and other general and administrative expense 
other general and administrative expenses were million in the period compared to million in the period 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to salaries and other personnel related costs associated with increased staffing  consulting and professional services expenses 
non cash stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees as well as the re measurement of deferred stock compensation for grants of stock options to non employees  we recorded an increase in deferred compensation on the balance sheet of million for the period ended december  and million for the period ended december  these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity deficit and are being amortized as charges to operations 
we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense for options granted as well as restricted stock purchase agreements as components of both research and development expense and general and administrative expense  which totaled million and million for the period ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was principally the result of the market price of our common stock at the end of  the amortization methodology utilized in accordance with fin and the inclusion of compensation expense related to restricted stock purchase agreements in the period 
there will also continue to be future non cash charges for the amortization of deferred compensation related to options granted to employees and consultants 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents following the sale of our series b and series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively  and the completion of our initial public offering in july related party transactions the company had outstanding full recourse loans aggregating  and  to certain officers and employees of the company at december  and  respectively 
the notes bear interest at rates ranging from to and have maturities through january an officer of the company is also a director of a private company that provided preclinical drug development services to the company totaling  in in october  a former officer of the company was retained as a consultant 
for these services he received  in an officer and director of the company is also the president of a consulting firm in the pharmaceutical industry that provided  in clinical trial design  data review and interpretational services to the company in liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock and the public sale of our common stock 
we intend to continue to use these proceeds to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million 
currently  our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million in cash used in operating activities related primarily to the funding of net operating losses partially offset by non cash charges related to amortization of deferred stock compensation as well as stock issuances pursuant to stock purchase agreements in the period 
our investing activities used cash of million in each of the years ended december  and compared to  in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment as well as the funding of tenant improvements in conjunction with the build out of new office space in the and periods 
we expect to continue making investments in our infrastructure to support our operations 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million in the amount consisted primarily of net cash proceeds of million from the issuance of our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in february and net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in july the cash flows from financing activities were primarily the result of the issuance of million of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we currently lease approximately  square feet of general office space 
lease payments under this lease agreement total million and commenced in october through the ten year term of the lease 
in april we completed the build out of tenant improvements and relocated to this facility and subsequently terminated existing sublease agreements on  feet of space 
in addition to office space we also lease equipment pursuant to operating leases 
our leases expire at various dates through under the terms of all of our leases  future minimum lease payments are as follows and thereafter  under the terms of our license agreement with albert einstein college of medicine  we are required to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and clinical events 
in the aggregate these success based milestones may total up to million including amounts due upon receipt of our first drug approval in the us and in specified foreign countries 
we also must pay albert einstein college of medicine royalties based on a percentage of net sales of our products 
if a product is combined with a drug or other substance for which we are paying an additional royalty  the royalty rate we pay to albert einstein college of medicine will be reduced by one half of the amount of such additional royalty 
since our inception we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million  including a net loss of million in  and we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the next several years 
since inception we have used million of cash in operating activities and million of cash in investing activities 
since inception  million of cash has been provided by financing activities 
at december  cash and cash equivalents were million 
we expect our cash requirements to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drugs  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our products  if any  and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this form k 
risks and uncertainties  in addition to those we describe below  that are not presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could suddenly decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks 
our brief operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess its future viability 
we were founded in may and we are still in the development stage 
our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company  acquiring  developing and securing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approval  formulate and manufacture product or conduct sales and marketing activities 
consequently  any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history 
we have a history of losses and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception  including a net loss of approximately million in the year ended december  as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we are not currently profitable 
even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our drugs  we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
we also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drugs  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we cannot successfully develop and commercialize our products  we will not be able to generate such revenues or achieve profitability in the future 
our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to complete planned additional clinical trials of any or some of our product candidates 
until we receive regulatory approval and commercialize one or more of our products  we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from cash on hand 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we experience unanticipated cash requirements  we may need to raise additional funds much sooner and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
even if we succeed in selling additional equity securities to raise funds  our existing stockholders ownership percentage would be reduced and new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we do not succeed in raising additional funds  we may be unable to complete planned clinical trials or obtain fda approval of our product candidates  and we could be forced to discontinue product development  reduce sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities 
if outside researchers fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  our regulatory submissions and our product introductions may be delayed 
we depend on independent investigators and collaborators  such as universities and medical institutions  to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us 
these collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
these investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves 
if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  the approval of our regulatory submissions and our introductions of new drugs will be delayed 
these collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of whom may compete with us 
if outside collaborators assist our competitors at our expense  our competitive position could be harmed 
if we are unable to design  conduct and complete clinical trials successfully  we will not be able to submit a new drug application to the fda 
in order to obtain fda approval of any of our product candidates  we must submit to the fda a new drug application  or nda  which demonstrates that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use 
this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests  which are referred to as preclinical studies  as well as human tests  which are referred to as clinical trials 
we have four product candidates in various stages of clinical trials including morviva tm previously known as pti injectible version and pti oral version  oxytrex tm previously known as pti  pti and pti we have completed multiple phase i and phase ii studies for morviva tm and two pharmacokinetic and safety studies for oxytrex tm  and we are designing and conducting clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these two drug candidates in different clinical settings of pain 
no significant trials are planned in the near future for pti or pti we will have to commit substantial time and additional resources to conducting further preclinical and clinical studies in several types of pain before we can submit ndas with respect to any of these product candidates 
our other product candidates are at a much earlier stage of development and will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing before we can make any decision to proceed with their clinical development 
human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement  in part because they are subject to rigorous requirements 
the clinical trial process is also time consuming 
we estimate that clinical trials of our leading product candidates will take a minimum of three years or more to complete and may take longer 
if we or the fda believe the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  we would have to suspend our clinical trials 
furthermore  failure can occur at any stage of the trials  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat clinical studies 
even if our clinical trials are completed as planned  their results may not support our product claims 
success in pre clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful  and the results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre clinical testing 
the clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses 
such failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates 
if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be allowed to commercialize our drugs and will not generate product revenues 
satisfaction of all regulatory requirements typically takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research and development and testing 
our research and clinical approaches may not lead to drugs that the fda considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses 
the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical testing or to commit to perform post marketing studies  in which cases we would have to expend additional unanticipated time and resources 
the approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation  future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay commercialization of  and product revenues from  our product candidates  impose costly procedures on us  and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy 
even if we comply with all fda requests  the fda may ultimately deny one or more of our ndas  and we may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
if we fail to achieve regulatory approval of any of our leading product candidates we will have fewer saleable products and corresponding product revenues 
even if we receive regulatory approval of our products  such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses or marketing claims we may make for our products 
further  later discovery of previously unknown problems could result in additional regulatory restrictions  including withdrawal of products 
in foreign jurisdictions  we must receive marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs 
foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the requirements and risks associated with the fda approval procedures described above 
if physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs  we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
even if the fda approves our drugs  physicians and patients may not accept and use them 
acceptance and use of our drugs will depend on a number of factors including perceptions by members of the healthcare community  including physicians  about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs  cost effectiveness of our drugs relative to competing products  availability of reimbursement for our products from government or healthcare payers  and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors  if any 
because we expect to rely on sales generated by our current lead product candidates for substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future  the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing 
if third party manufacturers of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns  or if their performance is substandard  our clinical trials and product introductions may be delayed and our costs may rise 
we have no manufacturing facilities and have limited experience in drug product development and commercial manufacturing 
we lack the resources and expertise to formulate  manufacture or to test the technical performance of our product candidates 
we currently rely on a limited number of experienced personnel and a small number of contract manufacturers and other vendors to formulate  test  supply  store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials 
our reliance on a limited number of vendors exposes us to the following risks  any of which could delay our clinical trials  and consequently delay fda approval of our product candidates and commercialization of our products  result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues contract commercial manufacturers  their sub contractors or other third parties we rely on  may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy clinical needs or commercial demand  may experience technical issues that impact quality  and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations 
the use of alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary governmental licenses to produce narcotic products is limited 
additionally  fda must approve any alternative manufacturer of our product before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce our clinical supplies 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly  or at all 
our contract manufacturers and vendors may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce  store and distribute our products 
approved third party commercial drug manufacturers may subsequently be stopped from producing  storing  shipping or testing our drug products due to their non compliance with federal  state or local regulations 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda  the dea and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
if any third party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to such innovation 
if we are unable to develop our own sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or if we are not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms  our product revenues could be disappointing 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize our products  if any are approved by the fda  we will either have to develop such capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties who can perform these services for us 
if we decide to commercialize any of our drugs ourselves  we may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales  marketing and distribution operations which are capable of successfully launching new drugs and generating sufficient product revenues 
in addition  establishing such operations will take time and involve significant expense 
on the other hand  if we decide to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to locate acceptable collaborators because the significant number of recent business combinations among pharmaceutical companies has resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators 
even if we are able to identify one or more acceptable collaborators  we may not be able to enter into any collaborative arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the nature of the market for pain management products  it may be necessary for us to license all or substantially all of our product candidates to a single collaborator  thereby eliminating our opportunity to commercialize other pain management products independently 
if we enter into any collaborative arrangements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we marketed and sold our products ourselves 
in addition  any revenues we receive would depend upon the efforts of our collaborators which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments  management turnover  change of strategic focus  further business combinations or other factors outside of our control 
depending upon the terms of our collaboration  the remedies we have against an under performing collaborator may be limited 
if we were to terminate the relationship  it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement collaborator on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our products receive fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products  or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
if our products are unable to capture and maintain market share  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
we will compete for market share against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies or other companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
many of these competitors have opioid painkillers already approved or in development 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do  as well as significantly greater experience in developing drugs  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of drugs  formulating and manufacturing drugs  and launching  marketing  distributing and selling drugs 
developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
alternative technologies and products are being developed to improve or replace the use of opioids for pain management  several of which are in clinical trials or are awaiting approval from the fda 
such alternatives include elan s ziconotide tm and endo pharmaceuticals morphidex r 
in addition  companies that sell generic opioid drugs represent substantial competition 
many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel  parties for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our competitors could develop and market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our products 
our success  competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
if either we or albert einstein college of medicine fails to file  prosecute or maintain any of our existing patents  our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of our products  and demand for our products could decline as a result 
we intend to file additional patent applications relating to our technology  products and processes 
we may direct albert einstein college of medicine to file additional patent applications relating to the licensed technology or we may do so ourselves 
however  our competitors may challenge  invalidate or circumvent any of our current or future patents 
these patents may also fail to provide us with meaningful competitive advantages 
we expect that we will rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know how or require us to license such information and pay significant fees or royalties in order to produce our products 
moreover  our technology could infringe upon claims of patents owned by others 
if we were found to be infringing on a patent held by another  we might have to seek a license to use the patented technology 
in that case  we might not be able to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if a legal action were to be brought against us or our licensors  we could incur substantial defense costs  and any such action might not be resolved in our favor 
if such a dispute were to be resolved against us  we could have to pay the other party large sums of money and our use of our technology and the testing  manufacture  marketing or sale of one or more of our proposed products could be restricted or prohibited 
competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense  and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  we could experience delays in completing necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval process or in formulating  manufacturing  marketing and selling our potential products 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in clinical research  preclinical testing  government regulation  formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals  particularly in the san francisco bay area  is intense  and our search for such personnel may not be successful 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success 
the dea limits the availability of the active ingredients in our current product candidates and  as a result  our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials  meet commercial demand or may result in clinical delays 
the dea regulates chemical compounds as schedule i  ii  iii  iv or v substances  with schedule i substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and schedule v substances the lowest risk 
the active ingredients in our current product candidates  including morphine  hydrocodone and oxycodone  are listed by the dea as schedule ii or iii substances under the controlled substances act of consequently  their manufacture  shipment  storage  sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation 
for example  all schedule ii drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician  physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription 
furthermore  the amount of schedule ii substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the dea and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand 
there is a risk that dea regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials  and in the future  our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand 
we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit testing of our products in response to product liability lawsuits 
the risk of product liability is inherent in the testing of medical products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or terminate testing of one or more of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
we currently carry clinical trial insurance but do not carry product liability insurance 
we may not be able to obtain such insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses  such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise 
our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from healthcare payers 
our ability to commercialize our drugs  alone or with collaborators  will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health maintenance organizations and health insurers  and other healthcare payers 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
healthcare payers  including medicare  health maintenance organizations hmo s and managed care organizations mco s  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and or are seeking pharmacoeconomic data to justify formulary acceptance and reimbursement practices 
government and other healthcare payers increasingly are attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs  and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has or has not granted labeling approval 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any products we discover and develop  alone or with collaborators 
if government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  market acceptance of them could be limited 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
the following factors  in addition to general market volatility and other risk factors described in this section  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  results of our preclinical and clinical trials  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under developments by us or others  comments by securities analysts  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume our share ownership is concentrated  and our officers  directors and principal stockholders can exert significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
due to their combined stock holdings  our officers  directors and principal shareholders shareholders holding greater than of our common stock acting collectively may have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
in addition  this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of these shareholders 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include  among other items  the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our product candidates  our need for clinical supplies and the re measurement of certain deferred stock compensation 
thus  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not indicative of what we might expect in the future 
as a result  in some future quarters our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
future sales of our common stock may impact the price of our common stock 
additional equity financings or other share issuances by us could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
additionally  sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that additional sales could occur could cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  and as of december  all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market and checking funds with variable  market rates of interest
