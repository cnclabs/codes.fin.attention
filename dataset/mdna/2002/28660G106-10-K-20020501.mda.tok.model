critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has recently issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
elizabeth arden believes the accounting policies below represent its critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have accounted for our acquisitions  including the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we often obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we periodically review intangible assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
in fiscal  we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas  new rules for measuring the impairment of brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles 
we are currently in the process of assessing the potential impact of this new statement on our financial statements and determining whether the adoption of fas will result in a noncash charge to net income 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for product which does not sell through to consumers 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical experience  sell through levels  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns and markdown allowances 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and markdowns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  reducing net income or increasing net loss 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  we generated million  or approximately  of our sales in the us and million  or approximately of our sales  internationally 
the increase in net sales is primarily as a result of increased sales from the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  partially offset by weakness in the retail environment 
the increase in sales includes an increase in the number of products sold by us  particularly elizabeth arden skin care and cosmetics products  as well as an increase in our customer base  primarily internationally and with us prestige department stores 
the weak retail environment  exacerbated by the events of september  had a particularly negative effect on sales to us prestige department stores  international travel retail outlets  and to certain international distributors 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million in fiscal as compared with million for fiscal  and gross margins expanded from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business 
following the acquisition  the mix of our sales has changed  with significantly increased sales of higher margin owned and licensed brands relative to lower margin distributed brands 
included in the gross margin for fiscal  are sales of elizabeth arden products we purchased prior to the acquisition  which are carried at a higher cost and resulted in a lower gross margin than sales of elizabeth arden products we manufactured after the acquisition 
once these lower margin products are sold  gross margins should increase 
for the year ended january   the effect on gross profit of selling arden product purchased prior to the acquisition was a reduction of gross profit of approximately million 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash inventory provision of million to write down certain distributed brands and non core product offerings that we do not intend to continue to carry due to retailer planogram updates and to expedite the sales of excess inventory  particularly gift sets and other promotional merchandise 
excluding the effect of the high cost products purchased prior to the acquisition  and the inventory provision  gross profit would have totaled million for a gross margin of 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal as compared with million in the prior year  reflecting additional selling and administrative costs associated with the elizabeth arden business acquired 
as a result of the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  there has been an increase in sales of owned and licensed brands  which require higher costs to support  including higher demonstration  advertising and product development expenses 
we added approximately  employees to our company in connection with the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  significantly increasing our international employee base  our us department store sales force and our administrative personnel 
the number of offices and facilities also increased as a result of the acquisition 
in fiscal  we commenced a restructuring of our operations in the united states  eliminating approximately positions  representing of our us headcount 
in conjunction with this restructuring we recorded a  charge included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition to this charge  we also incurred million of restructuring costs  primarily severance costs resulting from a realignment of our workforce and door closures  which has been recorded as an adjustment to the allocation of the purchase price in the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business 
of this million of restructuring costs  most of the cash was paid out between february and april for a discussion of the elizabeth arden acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of depreciation and amortization associated with the assets acquired as part of the arden acquisition 
approximately million of the increase in depreciation and amortization is associated with the assets acquired 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased approximately to million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal  as a result of increased debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business and associated working capital requirements 
the increased debt includes million of senior secured notes due  as well as borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a net benefit from income taxes of million for fiscal  as compared with a net provision of million for fiscal the effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of income before income taxes declined from of income in fiscal to of net loss in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is associated with the increase in our international operations  as we now operate in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
our international affiliates and subsidiaries have varying levels of profitability and tax rates 
in addition  we recorded an increase in the income tax valuation allowance associated with certain foreign losses and deferred tax assets 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss 
for fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million as compared with net income of million in fiscal the increase in net loss was due to increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and depreciation and amortization  which more than offset the increase in sales and gross profit and the benefit from income taxes 
accretion and dividend on preferred stock 
as part of the purchase price for the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  we issued to an affiliate of unilever  shares of series d convertible preferred stock 
the series d convertible preferred stock was recorded at its fair market value of million  with an allocation of million made for the beneficial conversion feature and reclassified to additional paid in capital 
the difference between the liquidation value of million and the balance recorded in the convertible  redeemable preferred stock account on the company s consolidated balance sheet is being accreted over the life of the series d convertible preferred stock 
for the year ended january   the company recorded million of accretion and million of dividends relating to the series d preferred stock 
the preferred stock carries a annual dividend yield  which is payable in january the accretion on preferred stock of million for fiscal is a non cash charge to net loss attributable to common shareholders 
net loss attributable to common shareholders 
net loss attributable to common shareholders totaled million in fiscal as compared with net income of million in fiscal the net loss attributable to common shareholders includes net loss plus the accretion and dividends associated with the series d convertible preferred stock 
ebitda 
ebitda operating income plus depreciation and amortization decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was a result of increases in selling  general and administrative expenses which offset increases in gross profit 
excluding the effects of high cost products purchased prior to the acquisition  the inventory provision  and the restructuring costs  ebitda would have totaled million 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  we generated million  or approximately  of our sales in the us and million  or approximately of our sales internationally 
the increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in the volume of products sold to existing customers 
sales to the company s top retail accounts increased by over the prior year 
management believes that increased sales during the fiscal year ended january   have resulted from our ability to provide our customers with a larger selection of products and a continuous  direct supply of products  and growth in sales of customized gift sets 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  the gross margin declined from in fiscal to for fiscal  as a result of higher warehouse and shipping expenses  which were partially offset by an increase in product sales of higher margin owned and licensed brands including brands acquired in connection with the arden acquisition 
the increase in warehouse and shipping expenses resulted from costs associated with the operation of our promotional set fulfillment center in edison  new jersey  the closing of a promotional set fulfillment center in pennsylvania in may  as well as a million integration charge to increase reserves related to inventory 
excluding this integration charge  gross profit would have totaled million with a gross margin of

selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased from for the fiscal year ended january  to for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in sg a expenses is primarily a result of million in integration charges for increases in reserves related to receivables as well as expenses related to the increase in sales 
excluding the effect of the integration charges  sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended january   as a percentage of net sales is  approximately the same percentage of expenses to net sales as recorded in the fiscal year ended january  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation and amortization related to i additional investments in tools and molds developed for our manufactured products  and ii intangibles and fixed assets acquired as part of the arden acquisition 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased approximately  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding under our credit facility to support working capital needs 
in addition  we incurred additional interest expense in conjunction with the arden acquisition from the closing date of january   including interest expense on our senior secured notes due and borrowings under our credit facility 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income 
net income decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january   including the effects of the integration charges 
excluding the effects of the integration charges  net income increased million or to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january   primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and gross margin 
ebitda 
ebitda operating income  plus depreciation and amortization decreased million or to million for the fiscal year ending january   from million for the fiscal year ended january   including the integration charges discussed above 
the ebitda margin declined to for the fiscal year ended january   from for the fiscal year ended january   including the integration charges 
excluding the integration charges  ebitda increased to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january   primarily as a result of the increase in sales 
excluding the integration charges  the ebitda margin was relatively flat at for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to for the fiscal year ended january seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in fiscal  of our net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from our customers  sales and results of operations can vary widely between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result we expect to experience variability in net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
we experienced seasonality in our working capital  with peak inventory and receivable balances in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january of each year  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
of that amount  million was generated from operating cash flows  offset by a net working capital use of  the net working capital use reflects increases in accounts receivable  prepaid and other assets  somewhat offset by a decline in inventories  and increases in accounts payable  other payables and accrued expenses 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from increased sales due to the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business coupled with the fact that no trade receivables were acquired with the business in january we used million of net cash in investing activities  comprised of million for capital expenditures partially offset by million received for the sale of certain trademarks and intangibles 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million  with payments on short term and long term debt being partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchase warrants 
cash and cash equivalents declined million to million 
during the fiscal year ended january   we generated million of cash from operating activities 
of that amount  million was generated from operating cash flows  offset by a million increase in working capital  including increases in accounts receivable and inventories and decreases in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in other payables and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million 
we used million of the cash generated for capital expenditures 
we also used million in cash for the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  including the cash portion of the purchase price plus cash expenses due at the closing on january  cash provided from financing activities totaled million and included million from the issuance of new senior secured notes and million borrowed under our million revolving credit facility 
proceeds from conversion of our convertible preferred stock  exercise of warrants and exercise of stock options provided an additional million  and share repurchases and repayment of long term debt used million 
cash and cash equivalents declined by million to million 
debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments 
at january   our long term debt and financial obligations and commitments by due date were as follows amounts in thousands payments due by less than period greater than contractual obligations total year years years long term debt     operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our long term debt and contractual financial commitments 
future liquidity and capital needs 
our principal future uses of funds are for debt service  working capital requirements and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
we have historically financed  and we expect to continue to finance our needs primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
we have a million revolving credit facility  which expires in january our borrowings under this facility are limited to a borrowing base  calculated based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories  and our borrowings are secured by a first priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventory 
as a result of weaker than expected performance in fiscal  we entered into an amendment to our credit facility which included the bank group s waiver of non compliance with certain financial ratios for the fourth quarter of fiscal  in particular the debt to ebitda ratio and the ebitda to net interest expense ratio  and an amendment of the related covenant levels for each quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal the amendment with the bank group also amends selected additional sections of the bank agreement and was signed on march  the revolving credit facility  as amended  provides for borrowings on a revolving basis  bearing interest  at our option  at either i over the london interbank offered rate or ii over the prime rate as quoted by fleet bank 
under the amended credit facility  we are required to meet certain covenants each quarter including i a limitation on debt to ebitda  ii a minimum level of ebitda to net interest expense  iii a minimum amount of shareholders equity  iv a minimum amount of ebitda each quarter of fiscal  v a minimum amount of availability under the credit line in the first and second quarters of fiscal  and vi a limitation of million on capital expenditures during fiscal and million plus up to million of unused capital expenditures from the prior year annually thereafter 
the revolving credit facility also requires periodic calculation of the borrowing base 
based upon our internal projections  we believe that the amended covenants provide sufficient flexibility so that we can maintain compliance with the covenants 
if our actual results deviate significantly from our projections  however  we may not remain in compliance with the covenants and would not be allowed to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  a default under our revolving credit facility which causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default on our senior notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our credit facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
as of january   we had million of borrowings under the credit facility and approximately million of availability under the borrowing base formula in our revolving credit facility 
we believe that internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service and working capital requirements for the next twelve months other than additional working capital requirements which may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or new product distribution arrangements 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations 
as a result of weaker than expected financial performance in fiscal  the rating on our senior notes was lowered by the rating agencies 
this could affect our ability to obtain acquisition or other financing on satisfactory terms 
the characteristics of our business do not generally require us to make significant ongoing capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended january   we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to in store counters and testing units  tools  dies and molds and computer hardware and software 
we expect to have approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal recently issued accounting standards in may  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives  which provides guidance on accounting for discounts  coupons  rebates and free products  as well as the income statement classification of these discounts  coupons  rebates and free products 
eitf is effective february  for us 
while we are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance  eitf will result in a reclassification of certain advertising and promotional costs from selling  general and administrative expense 
as a result it is expected that reported net revenues will decrease  cost of sales will increase  and there will be offsetting decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in april  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products  which provides guidance on the income statement classification of consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the retailer s purchase of the vendor s products or to promote sales of the vendor s products 
eitf is effective february  for us 
while we are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance  eitf will result in a reclassification of certain advertising and promotional costs from selling  general and administrative expense 
as a result it is expected that reported net revenues will decrease  cost of sales will increase  and there will be offsetting decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
fas  business combinations and no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill  and requires that unallocated negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
provisions of fas will be effective for our business acquisitions that are consummated after july  fas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets  and addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
under fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles need to be reviewed for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
in addition  the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
the provisions of fas will be effective february  for us 
we are currently in the process of assessing the potential impact of these new statements on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of fas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in fas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the provisions of fas will be effective for us as of february  we do not expect that the adoption of this will have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of january   we had million outstanding under our credit facility subject to variable rates 
furthermore  our borrowings under our credit facility are seasonal with peak borrowings in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
the average of our month end borrowings during fiscal was million 
accordingly  our earnings and cash flow will be affected by changes in interest rates 
with these average borrowings under our credit facility  and assuming there had been a two percentage point change in the average interest rate for these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense for the year ended january   would increase by approximately million 
to date  we have not engaged in derivative transactions to mitigate interest rate risk  as most of our debt which is in the form of senior notes and bears a fixed rate 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rate  management may take actions that would mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effect  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk we sell our products in over countries around the world 
for fiscal  the first full year after the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  we derived approximately of our net sales and of our gross margin from subsidiaries outside of the us we conduct our international operations in a variety of different countries and derive our sales in currencies including the euro  british pound  swiss franc and australian dollar as well as the us dollar 
our operations may be subject to volatility because of currency changes  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
in these countries our sales and expenses are typically denominated in local currency  while costs of goods sold are denominated in a combination of local currency and us dollar 
our results of operations are reported in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency rates can adversely affect our product prices  margins and operating costs as well as our reported results 
most of our skincare and cosmetic products are produced in a manufacturing facility located in roanoke  virginia 
a weakening of the currencies in which we generate sales relative to the currencies in which our costs are denominated  particularly the us dollar  may decrease our cash flow and operating profits 
our competitors may or may not be subject to the same fluctuations in currency rates and our competitive position can be affected by such changes 
while we periodically engage in currency hedging operations  primarily forward exchange contracts  to reduce the exposure of our cash flows to fluctuations in currency rates  we did not have any open contracts as of january  the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities was not material to our results in fiscal there can be no assurance that our hedging operations  if any  will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
as of january   our subsidiaries outside the united states held approximately of our total assets 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is either the us dollar or the local currency 
the cumulative effects of translating balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the us dollar at current exchange rates is included in accumulated and other comprehensive income on the balance sheet
