item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
with the exception of historical matters and statements of current status  certain matters discussed below are forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from targets or projected results 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed herein under the caption factors that may affect future results 
many of these factors are beyond our ability to predict or control 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly such forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in addition  as a result of these and other factors  our past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
business and industry overview ciber  inc and its subsidiaries provide information technology it system integration consulting and other services and to a lesser extent  resell certain hardware and software products 
our services are offered on a project or strategic staffing basis  in both custom and enterprise resource planning erp package environments  and across all technology platforms  operating systems and infrastructures 
our clients consist primarily of fortune and middle market companies across most major industries and governmental agencies 
we operate from branch offices across the united states  plus offices in canada and europe 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on discretionary spending by major corporations in the area of it 
due to current macroeconomic conditions  the demand for it services has been soft compared to prior years 
beginning in through the middle of  major corporations spent heavily on it services in order to prepare their information systems for the potential problems presented by the year yk 
companies with information systems applications that were not yk compliant either fixed those systems by re writing software code or implemented new systems that were yk compliant 
ciber participated in this heavy demand period by providing both yk remediation services  re writing software code to make systems yk compliant  and by providing erp implementation services  implementing new systems that were yk compliant 
after this period of spending on yk compliance  existing major corporations and well funded startup entities spent heavily on systems that supported the conduct of business over the internet 
for major corporations this spending on ebusiness initiatives was  in part  a defensive tactic against new businesses entering the market 
these new dot 
com business entities  raised a great deal of money in both the private and public equity markets and used a significant portion of those proceeds on information systems to support their new business models 
along with these dot 
com businesses came internet consultancies that provided information technology services to support the ebusiness initiatives of both new dot 
com business entities and existing corporations wanting to conduct business over the internet 
several of these internet consultancies were successful raising capital in the public equity markets and were also successful gaining acceptance as experts in the newer internet technologies 
as a consequence  a disproportionate share of the dollars spent on ebusiness initiatives by both new dot 
coms and existing corporations went to these new internet consultancies  at the expense of firms such as ciber  who had the expertise but not the reputation for delivering solutions in the newer internet technologies 
beginning in the latter part of and into  many of these dot 
com entities exhausted the capital raised in the equity markets  were not able to raise additional capital  and did not have a cash flow stream to support their businesses as going concerns 
consequently  many of these firms went out of business  and the threat of these dot 
coms to traditional business models waned  negatively impacting it spending on ebusiness initiatives 
as dot 
com entities began failing and it spending declined  many of the new internet consultancies that entered the market failed as well  making the competitive landscape less crowded for well established firms such as ciber 
while the failure of many internet consultancies was competitively beneficial to ciber  by the middle of the us economy was in recession and major corporations further curtailed discretionary it spending 
as we enter  we are hopeful that the us economic recession will be short lived  and that spending on it initiatives will grow at normal historical rates 
in that event  we believe that ciber is competitively well positioned due to our strong long term client relationships  our comprehensive service offerings and our competitive rate structure  among other factors 
business combinations we have completed business combinations since july for purposes of this report  the term acquisition refers to business combinations accounted for as a purchase and the term merger refers to business combinations accounted for as a pooling of interests 
our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of an acquired business since the date of acquisition 
mergers result in a one time charge for costs associated with completing the business combination 
unless the effects are immaterial  our consolidated financial statements are restated for all periods prior to a merger to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the merged company 
we completed six business combinations in  one in  five during the six months ended december  and ten business combinations during the year ended june  new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and specifies the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but instead will be reviewed annually or more frequently as impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separate intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the non amortization and amortization provisions of sfas are effective for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  as a result  we will not record any amortization of goodwill related to the acquisitions of century computer consultants  inc  aris corporation and metamor industry solutions inc 
during the last four months of with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   we will adopt sfas effective january  we expect the adoption of these accounting standards will result in a reduction of our amortization of goodwill commencing january   however  periodic impairment reviews may result in future write downs 
reporting segments in the second half of we reorganized some of our business operations 
in  we originally formed digiterra and announced our intent to spin off digiterra to ciber shareholders as a separate publicly traded entity 
in  as the result of unfavorable business and market conditions  the plans to spin off digiterra were cancelled and digiterra significantly refocused and restructured its business making leadership changes  organizational changes and transforming its costs structure 
most of the overhead that was established to support digiterra as a separate independent entity was eliminated late in as part of the digiterra reorganization  a new ciber division named ciber enterprise solutions ces was formed 
ces provides consulting services to support enterprise software of vendors such as oracle  peoplesoft and sap as well as customer relationship software such as siebel and onyx 
digiterra provides middle market companies with package software services  specializing in software from j 
d 
edwards and lawson  as well as supply chain services and hardware related technology solutions 
in september  we merged the operations of our subsidiary  waterstone  inc  into our ciber branch office operations  suspending its brand and eliminating the related corporate overhead costs 
as a result of the reorganizations in  at december  we have two reportable segments  custom solutions and package solutions 
the custom solutions segment primarily includes our ciber custom branch offices and our ciber solution partners european operations 
our package solutions segment is comprised of our ciber enterprise solutions division and our subsidiary digiterra  inc prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the current year presentation 
year end change effective december   we changed our year end from june to december as used herein  the term fiscal year refers to our fiscal year ended june results of operations other revenues include sales of computer hardware products  commissions on computer hardware and software product sales and software license and maintenance fees

other revenues decreased to million in from million in due to decreased hardware sales 
custom solutions revenues decreased while package solutions revenues decreased  when compared to last year 
custom solutions accounted for approximately of revenues in compared to in delayed starts to new projects and increased competition have created a very challenging it service marketplace in the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a decrease in billable consultants during the first half of the year  partially off set by the addition of approximately consultants as a result of our acquisitions of century computer consultants  inc  aris corporation and metamor industry solutions inc 
during the last four months of the year 
average billing rates remained consistent with the prior year 
gross margin percentage decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in this decrease is due to declining gross margins on consulting services offset partially by improved gross margins on other revenues 
consulting services gross margins declined primarily due to a decrease in the utilization levels of our consultants as well as increased consultant costs 
custom solutions gross margin on consulting services declined to in from in  while package solutions consulting gross margin declined to in from in gross margin percentage on other revenues increased due to decreased sales of lower margin computer hardware products 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in from million in  while as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in from in this reflects the semi fixed nature of sg a and the decline in revenues 
in september  we merged the operations of our subsidiary  waterstone  inc  into our custom solutions operations  suspending its brand and eliminating the related corporate overhead costs 
beginning in mid  in connection with our planned spin off of digiterra  we developed a corporate overhead structure for digiterra to prepare it to be an independent entity 
we reorganized digiterra s operations in the second half of and eliminated a large part of its corporate overhead costs 
as our focus continues to shift to more solutions oriented and project work  sg a is expected to increase as a percentage of sales and partially offset the expected higher gross margins on such work 
income from operations before amortization and other charges which is how we internally measure our operations decreased to million of revenues for from million of revenues in amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the effects of the goodwill write down in the september quarter 
other charges of million were incurred in these charges are comprised of million of severance costs and million of office closure costs 
in connection with our reorganization of our digiterra and waterstone subsidiaries  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred severance costs related to certain executive management positions that were eliminated 
in addition  during we incurred charges related to losses on excess office space that we have sub leased to other parties 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to write down the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions 
this charge represents the amount required to write down the goodwill to our best estimate of the future discounted cash flows of these operations 
in addition in  we incurred million of severance costs resulting from involuntary terminations related to personnel realignment   for an asset write down  and  of professional fees resulting from our planned spin off of digiterra 
in  as the result of changes in market and business conditions  the plans to spin off digiterra were cancelled 
net other income  including interest income and interest expense  decreased to  in from million for the year ended december  other income includes  and  in and  respectively  from gains on sales of investments

in addition  in connection with our acquisition of metamor in october  we borrowed under our line of credit 
tax expense was million in as compared to million for the year ended december  tax expense was recorded for the year ended december   even though pre tax loss was reported  because most of the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for income tax purposes since the majority of the impaired goodwill related to non taxable acquisitions 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment charge in the decrease in our effective tax rate in  results from a million federal and state tax benefit from adjusting our prior years estimate tax liability to actual amounts upon completion of our tax returns 
net income was million in as compared to a net loss of million in year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease in consulting services revenues and a decrease in other revenues 
other revenues decreased to million in from in due to decreased hardware sales and reduced software revenues 
custom solutions revenues decreased while package solutions revenues decreased  when compared to the prior year 
custom solutions accounted for approximately of revenues in compared to in during  there continued to be an industry wide shift in it spending  principally resulting from the resolution of the yk issue and erp curtailments 
many companies reduced it expenditures beginning mid due to completion of yk and erp specific projects and a general tendency to minimize new it initiatives during the end of this adversely impacted us  particularly in our mainframe staffing and erp related service offerings 
there was a significant industry trend toward new it services driven by the internet and increased bandwidth availability 
these new services include web designed  e business technologies  customer relationship management crm and supply chain software  and wireless integration  among others 
we have focused more of our efforts to deliver these newer it services 
these efforts include new alliances with independent software vendors  such as commerce one and siebel  and the realignment of our professional and sales personnel toward a greater focus on new technology services 
in addition  commencing in the spring of  the it services industry was negatively impacted by the shift in investor sentiment away from development and early stage dot 
com businesses 
as a result  industry demand for it services by dot 
com companies decreased significantly 
this has led to greater competition within the it services industry 
gross margin percentage decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in this decrease is due to declining gross margins on consulting services offset partially by improved gross margins on other revenues

net other income  including interest income and interest expense  decreased to million in from million in other income in includes gains of  from sales of investments and other income in includes a gain of  on the sale of our logisticspro software business 
the fluctuations in interest income and expense are the result of changes in our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed under our line of credit 
tax expense of million was recorded in even though a pre tax loss was reported 
tax expense was recorded for the year ended december  because most of the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for income tax purposes since the majority of the impaired goodwill related to non taxable acquisitions 
excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate would have been approximately in as compared to in tax expense for also reflects the effects of increased non deductible goodwill amortization  increased other non deductible expenses and increased state income taxes 
our net loss was million in as compared to net income of million in six months ended december  as compared to six months ended december  our total revenues increased to million for the six months ended december  from million for the six months ended december  this represents a increase in consulting services revenues offset by a decrease in other revenues  primarily sales of computer hardware products

selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for the six months ended december  compared to of revenues for the same period of this increase was due primarily to additional costs incurred for new programs implemented to position us for future growth  including the addition of senior and executive management team members  branding and marketing initiatives  and internal systems development

our effective tax rate for the six months ended december  was compared to for the same period of our effective tax rate for the six months ended december  increased due to increased nondeductible amortization resulting from certain acquisitions 
net income was million for the six months ended december  as compared to million for the same period of liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow and our available line of credit will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
as of december   we have purchased  shares for million under this program 
we may use significant amounts of cash for the repurchase of our stock or to acquire other businesses 
as a result  we may borrow to finance such activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million for the six months ended december   and million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in primarily reflects reduced income  compared to  excluding the non cash goodwill impairment charge

in  we received million for the sale of a building acquired through our acquisition of aris 
we purchased property and equipment of million during fiscal  million during the six months ended december   and million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively

we have reissued some of the treasury shares under our stock plans and in connection with acquisitions 
we have a million reducing revolving line of credit with a bank 
at the end of each calendar quarter the maximum available borrowing under this line of credit is reduced by million 
there was  outstanding under this line of credit at december  outstanding borrowings bear interest based on the bank s prime rate and ranges from prime minus to prime less  depending on our ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at december   the bank s prime rate was and our rate on borrowing was 
we are also required to pay a fee of per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
the credit agreement expires on september  seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
typically  operating income as a percentage of revenues is lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year because more holidays and vacations are taken at that time of year resulting in fewer hours billed in that period 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  costs to complete fixed priced projects  the realizability of goodwill  income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to pay amounts we have billed them 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
we recognize revenue on fixed priced contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
conditions that may trigger an impairment assessment include a history of operating losses of the related business  a significant reduction in the revenues of the related business  and a loss of a major customer  our market capitalization relative to net book value  among others 
an impairment would be considered to exist when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows 
to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we subsequently determine that we will realize more or less of our net deferred tax assets in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
factors that may affect future results included in this report and elsewhere from time to time in other written reports and oral statements  including but not limited to  the annual report to shareholders  quarterly shareholder letters  news releases and investor presentations  are forward looking statements about our business strategies  market potential  future financial performance and other matters which reflect our current expectations 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  those set forth below 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
growth through business combinations and internal expansion as an integral part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to expand by acquiring information technology businesses 
we regularly evaluate potential business combinations and aggressively pursue attractive transactions 
since july  we have completed business combinations 
the success of this strategy depends not only upon our ability to identify and acquire businesses on a cost effective basis  but also upon our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business with our organization and culture 
business combinations involve numerous risks  including the ability to manage geographically remote operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of losing clients and employees of the acquired business  and the risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience 
there can be no assurance we will be able to acquire additional business  or that any business combination will result in benefits to us 
in addition  we may open new offices in attractive markets with our own personnel 
many of our branch offices were originally start up operations 
not all branch offices  whether start up or acquired  have been successful 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully start up  identify  acquire  or integrate future successful branch office operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified consultants our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain adequately trained personnel who can address the changing and increasingly sophisticated technology needs of our clients 
our ongoing personnel needs arise from turnover  which is generally high in the industry  and client needs for consultants trained in the newest software and hardware technologies 
few of our employees are bound by non compete agreements 
competition for personnel in the information technology services industry is significant 
we have had  and expect to continue to have  difficulty in attracting and retaining an optimal level of qualified consultants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
dependence on significant relationships and the absence of long term contracts our five largest clients accounted for of our revenues in with our largest client accounting for of revenues 
we strive to develop long term relationships with our clients 
most individual client assignments are from three to twelve months  however  many of our client relationships have continued for many years 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contract at any time 
in addition  under many contracts  clients may reduce their use of our services under such contract without penalty 
if any significant client terminates its relationship with us or substantially decreases its use of our services  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  we have a significant relationship with peoplesoft as an implementation partner 
approximately of our revenues are from services related to peoplesoft software 
in the event peoplesoft products become obsolete or non competitive  or if we should lose our implementation partner status with peoplesoft  we could suffer a material adverse effect 
we have other similar relationships and strategic alliances with other technology vendors 
the sudden loss of any significant relationship or substantial decline in demand for their products could also adversely affect us 
management of a rapidly changing business our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  such as the evolution of the internet  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes  our business could suffer 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop service offerings that keep pace with continuing changes in technology  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
our success will also depend on our ability to develop and implement ideas for the successful application of existing and new technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or our ideas may not be successful in the marketplace 
products and technologies developed by our competitors may also make our services or product offerings less competitive or obsolete 
project risks we provide and intend to continue to provide project services to our clients 
projects are distinguishable from ciber s professional services staff supplementation contracts by the level of responsibility we assume 
with professional services staff supplementation contracts  our clients generally maintain responsibility for the overall tasks 
in a typical project  we assume major responsibilities for the management of the project and or the design and implementation of specific deliverables based upon client defined requirements 
as our project engagements become larger and more complex and often must be completed in shorter time frames  it becomes more difficult to manage the project and the likelihood of any mistake increases 
in addition  our projects often involve applications that are critical to our client s business 
our failure to timely and successfully complete a project and meet our client s expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such adverse effects may include delayed or lost revenues  additional services being provided at no charge and a negative impact to our reputation 
in addition  claims for damages may be brought against us  regardless of our responsibility  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims 
our contracts generally limit our liability for damages that may arise in rendering our services 
however  we cannot be sure these contractual provisions will successfully protect us from liability if we are sued 
we sometimes undertake projects on a fixed fee basis or cap the amount of fees we may bill on a time and materials basis 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays could make such projects less profitable or unprofitable and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we believe that we currently compete principally with it and internet professional services firms  technology vendors and internal information systems groups 
many of the companies that provide services in our markets have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced  and expect to continue to face  competition from new entrants into our markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
internet growth and usage our business is dependent in part upon continued growth of the use of the internet by our clients and prospective clients as well as their customers and suppliers 
if internet usage and commerce conducted over the internet does not continue to grow  the demand for our services may decrease and  as a result  our revenues would decline 
capacity constraints of the internet  unless resolved  could impede further growth of internet usage 
in addition  any laws and regulations relating to the internet that are adopted by governments in the united states or abroad that could reduce growth or usage of the internet as a commercial medium may impact our business 
we cannot predict how any such government regulations may affect our business 
however  if such regulations were to result in a decrease in the demand for our services  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
international expansion we expect to expand our international operations 
we currently have offices in five foreign countries canada  germany  hungary  the netherlands and the united kingdom 
our foreign operations accounted for of our revenues 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and providing our services internationally 
international operations are subject to political and economic uncertainties  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and new tax and legal requirements 
other risks inherent in international operations include managing geographically distant locations and customers  employees speaking different languages and different cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
if any of these risks materialize  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may affect our quarterly revenues or operating results generally include costs relating to the expansion of our business  the extent and timing of business acquisitions  our ability to obtain new and follow up on client engagements  the timing of assignments from customers  our consultant utilization rate including our ability to transition employees quickly from completed assignments to new engagements  the seasonal nature of our business due to variations in holidays and vacation schedules  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors  price competition or price changes  and our ability to manage costs and economic and financial conditions specific to our clients 
quarterly sales and operating results can be difficult to forecast  even in the short term 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our revenues or operating results in one or more future quarters will fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts or investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
price volatility the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts expectations  general economic  financial and other factors  and market conditions that can affect the capital markets 
in addition  reaction to announcements made by us or by our competitors  such as new contracts or service offerings  acquisitions or strategic investments may impact our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates on any borrowings we may have 
we currently do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
foreign exchange 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
during the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was attributable to foreign operations 
ciber does not enter into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign currency exchange risk on transactions denominated in foreign currencies or for speculative or trading purposes 
we believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk at december  is not material 
interest rates 
we have a million reducing revolving line of credit with a bank 
there was  outstanding under this bank line of credit at december  the interest rate on the line of credit is based on the bank s prime rate and ranges from prime minus to prime less  depending on our ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
therefore  as prime fluctuates  we would experience changes in interest expense related to any outstanding borrowings
