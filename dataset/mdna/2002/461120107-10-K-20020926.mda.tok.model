these risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control  and in many cases the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on the company s historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
management continually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as the business of the company and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements 
the following are the accounting policies and estimates which management believes to be most important to the business of the company 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when merchandise is delivered to customers or  in the case of service revenue  when the service has been performed 
for the company  net sales and operating revenues include items related to normal 
table of contents business operations  including the sale of goods to customers  service contract revenue  cellular and satellite activation income  residual income and sales based volume rebates 
retail sales are recorded at the time of the sale to the customer 
service contract revenue relates to the sale of extended warranty plans 
revenue from such plans  net of direct selling expenses  is recognized ratably over the life of the contract  generally three years 
cellular and satellite activation income is commission revenue received from carriers for obtaining new customers 
activation income is recognized when a customer s product is activated onto a particular carrier s network in one of the company s stores 
an appropriate provision for contract cancellations is also recorded  based on the company s historical cancellation experience 
residual income is participation income received from cellular and satellite carriers  based on the customer s continued use of the carrier s network 
residual income is recognized monthly  based on the contractual percentage of each customer s monthly bill 
sales based volume rebates are additional commission revenue from cellular and satellite carriers 
such rebates are recognized as income when prescribed activation level thresholds are achieved  either on a quarterly or on an annual basis 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable includes amounts due from its strategic vendor partners  commercial customers and its dealers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to the company 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the debt 
inventory inventory is the company s largest asset class  comprising over of the company s total assets 
the company s inventory consists primarily of finished goods held for retail sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  based on the average cost method  or market value 
purchase based volume rebates are credited to inventory or cost of products sold  as appropriate 
the company assesses the market value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of anticipated selling costs 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to realizable value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing realizable value including the quantity on hand  historical sales  technological advances  the existence of a replacement product  and consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
accrued expenses the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made which relate to the current accounting period 
these estimates range from things such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses to estimates of insurance  warranty and pending litigation claims 
in establishing appropriate accruals  management must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement that will ultimately be incurred 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid could differ from management s estimate 
income taxes the company is liable for income taxes in many jurisdictions including the united states  canada  including its provinces and  previously  australia and the united kingdom 
in making an estimate of its income tax liability the company must first make an assessment of which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular 
table of contents jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on the company s balance sheet 
if different judgments had been used  the company s income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
results of operations the company is engaged in the sale of consumer electronics products primarily through company operated retail stores and dealer outlets in canada 
the company s retail operations are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary  intertan canada ltd  which operates in canada under the trade name radioshack

previously awarded stock options  restrictive stock awards and certain other agreements payable in the company s common stock have also been adjusted or amended to reflect the split  on a retroactive basis 
overview there were a number of special factors and charges in fiscal years and that significantly impacted the company s results of operations and affected the comparability of the reported results with other periods 
during fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring charges of  in connection with the consolidation and integration of its corporate office with that of its canadian subsidiary and the reorganization of its merchandising and marketing departments

table of contents the company sold its australian subsidiary as of april  and recognized a gain of  accordingly  the company s operating results in australia reflect only ten months of operation and the gain on sale 
the effects of a weaker canadian dollar yielded an unfavourable comparison of operating income  measured in us dollars  in canada for fiscal year with the prior year 
measured in canadian dollars  operating income in canada increased by basis points 
sales outlets the geographic distribution of the company s sales outlets is summarized in the following table year ended june canada company operated dealer australia company operated dealer total company operated dealer in addition  the company operated  and rogers at t stores during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the fiscal year total includes battery plus stores 
the company s australian subsidiary was sold effective april the dealers included in the preceding table are independent retail businesses which operate under their own trade names but are permitted  under dealer agreements  to purchase any of the products sold by intertan company stores 
the dealer agreements contain a license permitting the dealer to designate the consumer electronics department of the dealer s business as a radioshack dealer or a tandy dealer  as applicable 
sales to dealers accounted for approximately  and of sales during fiscal year  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to explore opportunities to expand its dealer base in canada to produce profitable sales from communities too small to support company operated stores 
the company has entered into an agreement in canada with rogers to operate rogers at t telecommunications stores on its behalf 
at june   stores were in operation 
under the terms of this agreement  rogers leases the stores and is responsible for fixed costs  including rent and realty taxes 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of product from these locations and also receives an activation commission from rogers 
the level of commission received is usually lower than for identical product sold from the company s own stores 
this agreement runs through december since the rogers at t stores are not company owned  they are not included in the above table 

table of contents intertan s business is seasonal  sales peak in the november december holiday selling season 
the company s cash flow requirements are also seasonal since inventories build prior to the holiday selling season 
significant inventory growth typically begins to build in late summer and peaks in november 
profit and loss accounts  including sales  are translated from local currency values into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates 
the impact of fluctuations of local country currencies against the us dollar can be significant 
during fiscal year  both the canadian and australian dollars were weaker on average against the us dollar than they were in fiscal year as a result  the same local currency amounts translate into fewer us dollars as compared with the prior year 
for example  if local currency sales in canada in fiscal year were equal to those in fiscal year  the fiscal year income statement would reflect a decrease in sales when reported in us dollars 
the following table outlines the percentage change in the weighted average exchange rates of the currencies of canada and australia relative to the us dollar as compared to the prior year 
year ended june percentage change canada australia represents the weighted average exchange rate for the first ten months of fiscal year compared to the same period in the prior year 
goods and services tax australia effective july   australia moved from a wholesale based sales tax system to a goods and services tax or gst a system much like a european value added tax 
under the former wholesale based sales tax system  the tax was included in the retailer s cost 
the rates ranged from nil percent to  depending on the class of the goods 
the retailer recovered this tax by factoring it into the selling prices 
it is important to note that the wholesale tax was a tax on the retailer not the consumer 
however  the consumer ultimately paid through a higher retail price 
this wholesale based tax was replaced by the gst effective july  under the gst  instead of the retailer paying a tax on cost  the consumer now pays a tax at the point of sale on the selling price on the goods 
the rate is and  with one or two exceptions  applies to all goods and services 
for the retailer  this means a reduction in cost of all goods sold  since it no longer pays the sales tax 
however  it also means lower revenues  as the government has mandated that this tax saving must be passed on to the consumer  ie  the retailer cannot increase gross profit dollars as a result of the change 
management estimates that had the gst been in place during the first ten months of fiscal year  its sales and cost of products sold would have been approximately million lower than the amounts actually reported 
although gross profit dollars would have remained the same  the sales comparison with the prior year  the gross margin percentage  the selling  general and administrative percentage and the operating margin percentage would have all been affected 
management has adjusted the actual percentages used for comparative purposes 
table of contents to what they would have been had there been no wholesale tax in the prior year periods 
these adjusted amounts will be used in making comparisons with the current fiscal quarter results  as management believes this to be the most meaningful basis of comparison 
net sales and operating revenues when the sales of the company s australian subsidiary are removed from last year s sales  the canadian subsidiary showed a sales increase  in us dollars of  or 
the effects of a weaker canadian dollar adversely affected this comparison 
measured in local currency  sales in the company s canadian subsidiary increased by  with comparable store sales increasing by 
the difference between the total sales gain and comparable store sales growth is explained primarily by new stores 
at june   excluding the battery plus stores which were acquired late in the year  the company operated about more radioshack and rogers at t stores than at the same time last year 
an increase in after the sale compensation  including residuals and sales based volume rebates  which are not credited to individual stores was also a factor 
sales in the dealer division increased by

during fiscal year  consumers continued to demonstrate a preference towards a more digital focused product base 
this was most evident in the computer accessory and software categories  where sales increased by almost 
this strong performance reflects the emphasis placed on those categories by management through both promotion and a significant expansion in the product range 
importantly  included in the computer accessory category are video cameras which posted a sales gain of for the year 
following a successful test  a broader assortment of cameras was rolled out to a greater number of stores 
the company is currently refitting its stores to a model  which more prominently displays these and other higher growth  primarily digital  products 
the roll out of this new model will be complete in time for the holiday selling season 
the company s decision to introduce playstation video gaming products into its stores was well accepted by consumers 
from a zero base in fiscal year  these products accounted for over of the company s revenue in fiscal year management will continue to pursue opportunities to expand the video gaming business  provided it is satisfied with the incremental gross profit dollar potential of each respective line 
in the cellular category  sales of handsets were up 
however  due to continuing lower retail prices as a result of technological advances and competition among manufacturers  the increase in cellular revenue was lower  showing high single digit growth 
revenue from after the sale compensation and extended warranty plans also made a strong contribution to the revenue line  posting increases of and  respectively 
sales of computer hardware and monitors declined by during fiscal year earlier in the year  demand for older generation machines declined  as consumers delayed major purchases in anticipation of the introduction of windows xp and machines with pentium technology 
the effects of this drop in demand were further increased by the fact that early offerings of pentium machines were priced well above consumers comfort level 
during the critical holiday selling season  while demand for pentium computers was strong  the supply of ghz pentium chips was tight 
this situation was compounded by a low allocation by certain manufacturers to the canadian marketplace 
the end result was that very few of the company s stores had a consistent line up over the holiday period 
the sales comparison with the prior year was also adversely affected by the conclusion of a government sponsored program to subsidize the purchase of computers by families in the province of quebec 
this program produced a sales performance in the computer hardware category last year that proved impossible to match 
while the performance of the computer category was disappointing  it was reflective of a soft market in canada generally for pc s 
management believes that the canadian consumer s demand for high speed internet access combined with the benefits of windows xp to various applications  including digital photography  will continue to drive moderate demand for pentium computers and such products will continue to be featured significantly in the company s product assortment 
the sales performance in the satellite category was adversely affected by the activities of gray and black marketers  offering systems featuring us based programming at prices well below market levels 
while the supreme court of canada has since ruled the activities of these gray and black marketers to be illegal  the market has not recovered as rapidly as the company originally anticipated 
while the gray marketers are maintaining a lower profile from a marketing point of view  many of them are still in business  as enforcement action has been slow in escalation following the supreme court ruling 
while the company expects incremental satellite business as the gray marketers are gradually forced out of the marketplace and owners of gray market systems convert when countermeasures disrupt their signals  this transition could take some time 
for the year  unit sales of satellite systems increased by over the prior year  considerably less than the rate of growth experienced in the prior year 
however pricing action by the carriers and promotional activity by the company resulted in a drop in satellite revenues for the year 
sales of more traditional analog products  in general  yielded disappointing results 
sales of analog personal electronics  landline telephones and toys showed declines 
in some cases  the effects of unit sales growth were offset by falling retail prices  which put pressure on overall sales growth 

table of contents management will evaluate this information to migrate not only the company s product assortment but also its overall store plan to better present the products in demand by consumers 
consolidated sales for fiscal year in us dollars were  compared to  during fiscal year however  comparisons with the prior year were complicated by three significant factors the fiscal year year s sales include results for australia for ten months  weaker currencies in both countries  particularly in australia  and  the fiscal year sales in australia included the former wholesale sales tax 
see goods and services tax australia 
when the effects of all three factors are eliminated  consolidated sales for fiscal year  measured at the same exchange rates  increased by over fiscal year  with comparable store sales increasing by 
sales growth in canada during fiscal year was broadly based  with double digit gains occurring in almost one half of the company s major product categories 
sales of family radio service frs products grew significantly  with an increase in the traditional communications category of over 
the broader and deeper assortment of computer accessories introduced in fiscal year continued to pay dividends in fiscal year  with a sales increase of over 
the final roll out of the company s panasonic store in store fixture was completed during fiscal year  contributing to a sales gain in the audio video category of over 
unit sales of direct to home satellite increased by over 
sales of cellular handsets grew by about 
while sales of cpus increased by over  much of this increased activity was of a promotional  clearance nature  at the expense of gross margins 
in australia  sales growth during fiscal year was focused on a more narrow range of product categories 
sales of computer accessories increased by over reflecting a much broader product assortment 
however  sales of cpus and monitors declined by  as the pc market was weak in australia for a significant part of the fiscal year 
the significantly weakened australian dollar made many of the newer innovative machines with accessories such as cd rw a very high ticket item and unaffordable to many customers 
in addition  the roll out of high speed internet access has been very slow in australia 
accordingly  the demand for faster replacement machines  which high speed internet access has created in other markets  was virtually non existent in australia  despite managements multiple attempts to encourage infrastructure providers 
the addition of two new carriers to the company s cellular line up  together with increased focus by our sales management and associates  contributed to significant growth in that category in both prepaid and contracted phones 
importantly  unit sales of contracted phones  which bring in a stream of residual income  increased by over 
sales of audio video products increased by in response to a product offering with a more branded focus 
sales declines were experienced in many of the company s traditionally strong categories  including personal electronics  parts and accessories  batteries  regular telephones  and toys 
a variety of factors may have contributed to this disappointing sales performance including  among others  an overall weak retail economy  the effects of the introduction on a new warehouse and distribution system and uncertainty and morale problems attendant with the sale of this subsidiary and the necessary involvement of local management in the sale process 
sales growth in canada during fiscal year was broadly based  with gains being achieved in most major core categories 
sales of direct to home satellite systems increased by over  as the company became a destination of choice for consumers who wish to buy this popular product 
wireless products continue to be popular with consumers and the company increased revenues in this category by over 
the audio video category also performed well with a sales increase of over  reflecting in part the rollout of the proven store in store panasonic fixture to company operated stores 
sales of computer accessories and software increased by over as the company offered a broader and deeper assortment of these products 
although 
table of contents introduced in the canadian market too late in the year to have a meaningful impact on sales in the communications category  sales of the newly approved frs products were very strong in may and june 
fiscal year sales growth in australia was more narrowly focused  with gains concentrated in a few key categories 
fiscal year saw the roll out of a new strategy for personal computers  with a wider range of models available in more of the company s stores 
this strategy was successful in producing a sales gain in that category of over 
sales of cpus and monitors were also used to drive the sale of computer accessories  which grew by over 
fiscal year was a difficult year for cellular in australia 
as the analog system was eliminated at the end of calendar year  many of the late adopters to digital were infrequent users who opted to purchase the cheaper and less profitable prepaid models 
competition intensified in the distribution channel  putting pressure on both pricing and margins 
gross profit gross profit dollars for fiscal year were  lower than during fiscal year this reduction is more than explained by the sale of the company s australian subsidiary and a charge of  to write down inventory in the canadian subsidiary to net realizable value 
the following summarizes the components of the change in gross profit from the prior year change in gross profit us dollars in thousands increase in sales reduction in the gross margin percentage foreign currency rate effects inventory adjustment see discussion below effect of sale of australian subsidiary during the latter part of fiscal year  the company carried out an in depth review of its merchandising strategy in light of changing consumer preferences  consumer perceptions of the company s stores and product positioning 
as a consequence of that study  management took the decision to refocus the company s product assortment to expedite the acceleration of the company s transition to a more streamlined merchandising strategy focused on higher growth products  to improve product adjacencies and to create an innovative category management strategy  while maintaining a strong focus on its core electronic  wireless and accessories business 
in order to facilitate this transition  the company has re evaluated its merchandise offering  and commenced an aggressive strategy to eliminate products incongruent with its new assortment 
as a consequence of this decision  the company recorded a charge of  to write down the affected inventory to net realizable value 
the following table illustrates gross profit as a percentage of sales  by segment 
table of contents year ended june as a percentage of sales canada australia consolidated includes the inventory adjustment of  described above 
represents the gross margin percentage in australia for the first ten months of fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year have been adjusted to exclude the effects of the former wholesale sales tax in australia the reduction in the gross margin percentage in canada during fiscal year was basis points 
of this amount  basis points are explained by the effects of the inventory charge described above 
the sell through of the affected inventory had a further impact on the gross margin percentage as it yielded nominal gross profit dollars 
liquidation of the remaining inventory during fiscal year will have a small affect on the gross margin percentage next year 
the remainder of the decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily as a result of sales growth in high tech  primarily digital product categories 
during fiscal year  the company offered a significantly enhanced range of digital products  as consumers preferences shifted towards these products relative to more traditional analog technologies 
while many of these products carry less than the company s traditional margins  management believes that the strategic shift in product preferences will continue and management will continue to position the company for profitable sales growth in response to these changes in demand 
sales declines during the year in more conventional landline telephones  personal electronics and toys also put pressure on margins 
management anticipates that the continued shift in the product sales mix towards these products could have an impact on the comparable gross margin percentage during fiscal year of up to basis points 
the pressure on margins generated by these shifts in product demand was partially offset by the company s continued strong performance in subscriber based services and attendant increases in after the sale compensation in the form of residuals and  in particular  sales based volume rebates 
for the year  after the sale compensation  which has no associated product cost  was approximately  about of total revenue 
on a comparable basis  this represented an increase of over the prior year 
it has been  and will continue to be  management s policy to pursue opportunities for profitable sales growth  ie  growth which will yield increases in gross profit dollars that exceed incremental selling  general and administrative expenses 
as previously indicated  management believes that a modest reduction in the comparable gross margin percentage may continue into fiscal year as customers continue to demand the latest in digital technology 
the future sales performance in the computer hardware and satellite categories will also have an impact on the gross margin percentage 
the stronger these categories perform  the greater management expects gross profit dollars to grow  with attendant pressure on gross margin percentages 
however  management believes the incremental gross profit dollars generated by such sales would exceed direct selling expenses  thereby increasing operating income 
digital products typically offer lower percentage margins  but are nevertheless profitable products 
in addition  while these products initially carry below company average margins  many offer opportunities to generate after sale compensation in the form of residuals  and sale based bonuses 
as previously indicated  during fiscal year  after sale compensation streams generated approximately  in revenue  about of total revenue  and improved the gross margin percentage by basis points 
management believes these future revenue streams will partially 
table of contents mitigate the margin decline 
in addition  many of these products present opportunities to sell related  and more profitable  parts and accessories 
the reduction in the gross margin percentage in canada during fiscal year was split between the effects of a sales mix which continued to shift towards newly introduced  primarily digital  products which carry margins less than the company s average  and clearance activity  primarily in the computer category  as the company made room for newer  faster models 
promotional activity to reduce higher than expected post holiday season inventory placed pressure on margins in the second half of the year 
management took a number of initiatives during the year to reduce the pressure on the gross margin percentage 
one of these was the heavier promotion and expansion of the company s traditional and highly profitable range of accessories 
the company introduced a new store specific micro assortment replenishment program during fiscal year the goal of this program is to get the right inventory  in the right stores  in appropriate quantities  to capitalize on sales opportunities within each given market  thus contributing to reduced obsolescence and inventory shrink 
in australia during fiscal year  the effects of the shift in the sales mix towards lower margin  primarily branded and digital products was greater than in canada because this change in merchandising strategy was in an earlier stage in the rollout process than in canada 
another factor contributing to the gross margin decline in australia during fiscal year was a change in the wireless offering 
while the new pricing structure with the carriers preserved gross profit dollars  it did reduce the gross margin percentage significantly 
other contributing factors to the margin decline in australia included the following an advertising plan during the holiday selling season  which focused on television and emphasized lower margin percentage  higher margin dollar wireless and computer products 
advertising funds were diverted from print media  which can portray the company s assortment of higher margin products and accessories more effectively  the bundling of accessories with wireless handsets to meet the competitive environment  more aggressive price positioning on selected products  soft sales in many traditional higher margin products including parts and accessories  batteries  toys and communications products  and  a weak australian dollar  which forced up costs on imported goods 
a soft consumer market and the post gst pricing regulations made it difficult to pass many of these increases to the customer 
in canada and australia  the gross margin percentages in fiscal year all came under pressure as management pursued a planned strategy of transforming the company from a niche retailer of primarily private label end products and  parts and accessories into a dynamic retailer of state of the art  high tech and primarily branded products 
this strategy impacted the gross margin percentage in four ways gross profit dollars rose significantly during each period  management embarked on a strategy specifically designed to place the pursuit of incremental gross profit dollars and improvements in operating margin as paramount in importance 
accordingly  the company developed and implemented strategic alliances with key national and international brands  margins within product categories declined as nationally branded product replaced higher margin private label goods  and  overall margins declined as sales of certain popular products  including computers  wireless and  in canada  home satellite  increased at a rate disproportionate to the overall increase in sales 
these products generally carry margins that are below the company s average 
the impact of the third of these factors was particularly noticeable in australia during fiscal year  as the percentage of computers and related accessories in the overall sales mix increased by almost 
a shift in the 
table of contents wireless business in australia away from more profitable contract plans to prepaid airtime models was also a factor

the gain on disposal reported in the fiscal year was based on management s calculation of certain adjustments to be paid following completion of the sale 
the purchaser has advised the company that it disagrees with management s calculation of those adjustments and has commenced legal action in support of its claim 
management believes that its calculation of the adjustments is appropriate and that there are strong arguments against the position adopted by the purchaser

interest income and expense interest income was   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the reduction in interest income during fiscal years and resulted from a reduction in the company s cash resources as a result of the repurchase of common stock during those periods 
the effects of this decline in cash on interest income were partially offset by proceeds received on the sale of the australian subsidiary during the fourth quarter of fiscal year declining interest rates were also a factor in the reduction in interest income 
management anticipates a significant reduction in interest income during fiscal year as the various stock repurchase programs completed since the third quarter of fiscal year have consumed its surplus cash resources 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the increase in interest income during fiscal year was reflective of the company s improved cash position and  to a lesser extent  higher interest rates 
interest expense during fiscal year decreased by  interest expense for the year consisted entirely of amortization of loan origination costs and standby fees  as the company did not need to borrow under its credit line during the year 
management anticipates that interest expense will increase during fiscal year  as it will be necessary to borrow to finance the seasonal build up of inventories and  possibly  the repurchase of additional common stock 
interest expense during fiscal year increased by  this increase resulted from third party borrowings to finance the build up of inventories for the holiday selling season

income taxes the provision for income taxes in fiscal year includes a provision for canadian taxes on the profits of radioshack canada 
the provision for fiscal years and includes provisions for canadian and australian taxes on profits earned in those countries  although no provision for australian taxes was made during fiscal year  because the australian subsidiary had a pre tax loss through the date of its sale 
as discussed more fully below  the fiscal year provision included a special charge of  related to the settlement of outstanding issues with the canadian and united states authorities as well as a provision of  relating to the sale of the australian subsidiary 
see gain loss on disposal of subsidiary companies 
during fiscal year  the company reached an agreement with the canadian tax authorities relating to the settlement of a dispute regarding the to taxation years 
while the amount in dispute has been agreed  a settlement agreement has been executed and substantial payments made  the company has not yet been fully reassessed and  accordingly  this amount has not been paid in full 
late in fiscal year  the company reached an agreement with both the canadian and united states tax authorities  settling substantially all of its remaining outstanding tax issues and recorded an additional provision of  a payment of  was made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in full satisfaction of the matters agreed with the united states tax authorities 
although agreement in principle has been reached on the remaining canadian issues  final statements summarizing amounts owing have not been received 
because of the age of these issues and the terms of the settlements  there are complex interest computations to be made 
accordingly while substantial payments have been made  it is not practical 
table of contents for management to determine with precision the exact remaining liability associated with these matters 
management estimates that the liability to settle all outstanding canadian tax issues  including the matter described in the paragraph immediately above  is approximately  management further believes that it has a provision recorded sufficient to pay the estimated liability resulting from these issues  however  the amount ultimately paid could differ from management s estimate 
the company has one remaining issue in dispute with the internal revenue service irs in the united states 
the company disagrees with the position of the irs on this issue and  on the advice of legal counsel  believes it has meritorious arguments in its defense and is in the process of vigorously defending its position 
it is management s determination that no additional provision need be recorded for this matter 
however  should the irs prevail in its position  the company could potentially have an additional liability of  earnings per share basic earnings per share eps is calculated by dividing the net income or loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period 
diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted 
the company s only dilutive instruments are the options to purchase common stock held by the company s directors and employees 
at june   the company s directors and employees held options to purchase  common shares at prices ranging from to per share 
during quarters one through four of fiscal year  all but    and nil of options then outstanding were included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share 
these options were excluded because the option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common stock during the particular quarter 
the dilutive effect of the various options held by the company s directors and employees in future periods will depend on the average market price of the company s common stock during such periods

income taxes payable consumed  in cash  primarily as a result of the payment of balances relating to prior years 
see income taxes 
in addition  installments of canadian taxes for fiscal year exceeded taxes actually payable for the year 
this is because installments were based on actual taxes payable for fiscal year this overpayment will be refunded during fiscal year a reduction in accounts payable also contributed to the amount of cash consumed by working capital requirements 
this reduction reflects renewed emphasis on inventory management 
the effects of reductions in the level of income taxes and accounts payable on cash were partially offset by a reduction in inventory levels and an increase in accrued expenses 
the inventory reduction is part of an overall strategy of improving inventory management through a more focused merchandising strategy  increasing inventory turns and having a better in stock position 
this increase in accrued expenses is primarily attributable to the accrual of capital costs associated with the distribution center project

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of market risks arising primarily from the impact of changes in interest rates on its short term credit facilities and from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as they relate to its investment  debt and activities in canada 
foreign currency fluctuations the company s activities are carried on in canada and  previously  australia 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risks in three broad areas its inventory purchases  translation of its financial results  and its net investment in canada 
during fiscal year  radioshack canada purchased approximately of its inventories in the far east 
these purchases are made in us dollars and  under the terms of its agreement with its suppliers  payment must be made at the time of shipment 
accordingly  there is risk that the value of the canadian dollar could fluctuate relative to the us dollar from the time the goods are ordered until shipment is made 
management monitors the foreign exchange risk associated with its us dollar open orders on a regular basis by reviewing the amount of such open orders  exchange rates  including forecasts from major financial institutions  local news and other economic factors 
based on this input  management decides whether or not to lock in the cost of a portion of those orders in advance of delivery by purchasing us dollars or forward exchange rate contracts to be settled on or near the estimated date of inventory delivery 
the table below shows the amount of open orders at june  and  foreign exchange contracts and us dollars on hand at june  and which had been designated as a hedge against such open orders and the financial impact which would result if the local currencies were to decline in value by relative to the us dollar from june  and to the date of delivery 
june  june  us dollars in thousands open orders impact of a decline in local currency values foreign exchange contracts and us dollars on hand impact of a decline in local currency values net impact of a decline in local currency values the incremental cost of such a decline in currency values  if incurred  would be reflected in higher cost of sales in future periods 
in these circumstances  management would take product pricing action  where appropriate 

table of contents translation of financial results the functional currencies of the company s operating entities in canada and  formerly in australia  are the respective local currencies 
however  the reporting currency of the company on a consolidated basis is the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the value of the canadian and australia dollars have a direct effect on reported consolidated results 
it is not possible for management to effectively hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
the following table shows the combined sales and operating income for fiscal years and the effect that a decline in local currency values would have had on those results 
the effects of the company s former subsidiary in australia  including the gain on its disposal  have been excluded from the fiscal year amounts

net investment in foreign jurisdictions the company s net investment in canada is recorded in us dollars at the respective period end rates 
changes in these rates will have a direct effect on the carrying value of this investment 
the cumulative effect of such currency fluctuations is recorded in stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company currently has no plans to hedge its investment in canada
