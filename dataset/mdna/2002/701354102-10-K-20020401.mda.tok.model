these risks include  but are not limited to  the continuing losses of the company which may result in the need for additional capital in the future or a change in current operations  the need for substantial capital and use of current working capital to develop new products and for research and development  uncertainty of product development  technological obsolescence  market acceptance of its products and dependence on third party suppliers and distributors 
the company may also have to expend substantial employee time and financial resources to meet governmental regulation requirements and for the protection of its intellectual property rights

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which include allowance for bad debts  inventory reserves  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for product sales  these criteria are generally met at the time product is shipped 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties 
for training and other service revenue  the company recognizes revenue as the services are complete and the company has no significant remaining obligation to the customer 
revenue from multi element support contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement  generally one year 
o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
o the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
general the company has made significant investments in developing the technology and manufacturing capability for its products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
the company has not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset its operating expenses 
to date the company has used the proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to fund its operations 
the company anticipates increases in revenues in these increases are subject to the company continuing to expand its product lines and attracting additional means of distribution and customers  among other things 
the company intends to continue to use its working capital to build its infrastructure to support future marketing and sales and research and development activities for its products 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in increased sales  new products  or technological advances or that the company has adequate capital to complete its products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital 
results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the company s revenues to date have been generated entirely by its video division 
revenues generated by the company s major product lines  including service and support related to those products  as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows cameraman r systems pvtv tm systems support and other services the number of cameraman r and pvtv tm systems sold and the average selling price per system for the years ended december   and were as follows camera systems pvtv tm systems avg 
selling avg 
selling systems price per systems price per sold system sold system the decrease in revenues from to was due to a decline in sales of both major product lines 
the decline in camera sales is primarily due to reduced sales to forgent corporation  formerly vtel corporation vtel 
the company believes this resulted from the restructuring of vtel during which ended with the spin off of vtel s product division in march in addition to the decline in vtel sales  the company s single chip camera sales declined overall 
the company believes this was caused by increased pricing pressure from competing technologies as well as the company s decision to focus its sales and marketing efforts on its pvtv tm product line 
the decrease in revenue from pvtv tm products is due a decline in group sales revenue in in comparison with  as well as a decrease in the average selling price per system 
in  the company recognized revenue on nine systems sold to the ackerley group ackerley which accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in the company received purchase contracts from two broadcast ownership groups in for a total of stations  however  because of customer installation schedules  only three of these systems were delivered in the remaining systems are reported in the company s backlog and are expected to be delivered during the first and second quarters of the decrease in the average selling price per system is due to increased sales of the lower end pvtv tm systems  and decreased sales of dual system packages which have a higher selling price per installation 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily the result of increased revenues from pvtv tm systems and related support services 
the increase in revenue from pvtv tm systems is due to an increase in the number of systems sold as well as an increase in the average selling price per system 
the increase in the number of pvtv tm systems sold is because of the company s direct selling efforts and marketing of this new product line and the sale of nine systems to ackerley 
the increase in the average selling price is due to higher discounts offered on system sales as they represented pilot sites  as well as increased sales of digital systems and dual systems in which have a higher selling price 
although the company anticipates further declines in its camera system revenues in  the company anticipates overall revenue will increase from the sales of its pvtv tm systems and related services and support

the increase in margin from to is primarily due to the increased revenues from pvtv tm systems which have a higher gross margin percentage per system sale than the historical camera sales as well as increased production efficiencies recognized during the second half of the margin increase is offset somewhat by increases in the company s inventory reserves due to a shift in market demand from analog to digital pvtv tm systems 
fluctuations in margin are in part due to changes in the product mix and discounts offered on used systems to reduce the company s inventory of finished products used for demonstrations and tradeshows 
while the company continuously works to improve its gross margin through product pricing  labor efficiencies  reduction of overhead  and product design  there can be no assurance that gross margins will improve significantly over  or remain stable with  the gross margins attained in due to the highly competitive nature of the industry  the introduction of new products  and fluctuations in the cost of component parts
