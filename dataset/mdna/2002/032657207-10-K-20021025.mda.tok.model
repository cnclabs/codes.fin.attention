securities and exchange commission sec has issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
in frr  the sec defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for product sales with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
hardware and software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contracts 
service revenues are recognized at the time the services are rendered 
the company provides engineering services to some of its customers on a contractual basis and recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method 
revenue related to the hotel operations is recognized as services are performed 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
the company places its cash investments and marketable securities in high credit quality financial instruments and by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
the company grants credit to domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users  performs ongoing credit evaluations and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collections issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since the accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivables and future operating results 
investments in and advances to affiliated companies the company has several investments in affiliated companies related to areas of the company s strategic focus 
the company accounts for these investments using the equity method of accounting 
in assessing the recoverability of these investments  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based on changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the affiliated companies  market conditions and the industry and economic environment in which the entity operates 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of affiliated companies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
intangible and other long lived assets the company has intangible and other long lived assets primarily related to technology  licenses  capitalized software and property  plant and equipment 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  the expected period in which the asset is to be utilized  changes in technology and customer demand 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal product revenue for fiscal was million as compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the sale of medical instrumentation technology products of million or  attributed to lower demand for the company s cardiovascular  patient monitoring systems and medical imaging equipment  and a decrease in the sale for its signal processing technology products of million  or  due primarily to the decline in the demand for its semi conductor automatic test equipment ate boards

during fiscal year  the company recorded asset impairment charges totaling million on a pre tax basis 
as a result of the continued decline in the economic and business conditions in the telecommunications industry  analogic decided to terminate activities related to anatel  the company s wholly owned telecommunications subsidiary 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of purchased intangibles and other long lived assets 
the impairment charge is equal to the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeded the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows 
additionally  a pre tax charge of 
million related to obsolete inventory  as well as a pre tax charge of million related to capitalized software  has been recorded as those assets have been deemed to be unrecoverable 
during fiscal  the company made the decision to reorganize anatel and focus on a limited number of products 
in connection with this decision  the company recognized asset impairment charges of million in fiscal attributable to certain assets of anatel 
the company also decided to discontinue the sales of certain of its older and unprofitable product lines within its semi conductor test equipment business in order to focus its resources on potential growth areas within this business

basic earnings per share were compared to for fiscal diluted earnings per share were compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and million at july  and  respectively 
the increase of million is primarily due to million of cash advance received for the purchase of long lead time components and million remaining of ramp up funds for infrastructure enhancements  as part of the exact agreement 
working capital was million and million at july  and  respectively 
the company s balance sheet reflects a current ratio of to at july  compared to to at july  excluding the cash impact from the exact agreement noted above  liquidity is sustained principally through funds provided from operations  with short term time deposits and marketable securities available to provide additional sources of cash 
the company faces exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates

the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximate fair value at july  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
the company maintains a bond investment portfolio of various issuers  types  and maturities 
this portfolio is classified on the balance sheet as either cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities  depending on the lengths of time to maturity from original purchase 
cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase 
investments having maturities from the time of purchase in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as available for sale 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
cash flow provided from operations was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows from operations in fiscal over fiscal primarily resulted from an increase in advance payments and deferred revenues consisting primarily of a million advance received for the purchase of certain long lead time components and million of ramp up monies remaining for infrastructure enhancements to ramp up production and increase manufacturing capacity related to the company s exact contract  a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to increased collections efforts partially offset by an increase in inventory of million primarily for raw materials 
the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal over was primarily due to the result of an increase in operating income  a decrease in working capital balances  and an increase in other non cash items

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after june  the company has adopted sfas no 
in the fiscal year ended july  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and was adopted by the company  as required  on august  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position and results from operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position and results from operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
supersedes fasb  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and thus the company has adopted this requirement beginning august  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position and results from operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
therefore  sfas no 
eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and  therefore  will be adopted by the company on january  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position and results from operations 
business environment and risk factors forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains statements  which  to the extent that they are not recitation of historical facts  constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements  including statements about product development  market and industry trends  strategic initiatives  regulatory approvals  sales  profits  expenses  price trends  research and development expenses and trends  and capital expenditures involve risk and uncertainties and actual events and results may differ significantly from those indicated in any forward looking statements as a result of a number of important factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere herein 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to analogic common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business 
any of these risks could have a material and negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because a significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a small number of customers  any decrease in revenue from theses customers could harm our operating results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in our customers orders may have a significant impact on our operating results 
if a major customer significantly reduces the amount of business it does with us  there would be an adverse impact on our operating results 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our net product and engineering revenue for our three largest customers in any of the last three fiscal years and the percentage of our total net sales to our ten largest customers in those years year ended july  philips general electric l communications toshiba ten largest customers as a group although we are seeking to broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers 
because it often takes significant time to replace lost business  it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel  delay or reduce significant orders in the future 
our customer agreements typically permit the customer to discontinue future purchases after timely notice 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with the products we sell and the services we provide to our major customers 
although our major customers are large corporations  if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise be unable to pay for our services  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
competition from existing or new companies in the medical instrumentation technology industry could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we are subject to competition based upon product design  performance  pricing  quality and services and we believe our innovative engineering and product reliability have been important factors in our growth 
while we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products which are directly comparable to products manufactured by others  in many instances our products will conform to more exacting specifications and carry a higher price than analogous products manufactured by others 
our competitors include divisions of some larger  more diversified organizations as well as several specialized companies 
some of them have greater resources and larger staffs than we have 
many of our oem customers and potential oem customers have the capacity to design and manufacture the products we manufacture for themselves 
we face competition from research and product development groups and the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal research and product development and manufacturing versus outsourcing 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for our components  and our production would be substantially curtailed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are not available 
we order raw materials and components to complete our customers orders  and some of these raw materials and components are ordered from sole source suppliers 
although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components  we sometimes experience short term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
in the past  there have been industry wide shortages of electronics components 
if a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur  we may have to delay shipments or pay premium pricing  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  supply shortages of particular components will substantially curtail production of products using these components 
we are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers 
accordingly  some raw material and component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
we also depend on a small number of suppliers  some of whom are affiliated with customers or competitors and others of whom may be small  poorly financed companies  for many of the other raw materials and components that we use in our business 
if we are unable to continue to purchase these raw materials and components from our suppliers  our operating results would be adversely affected 
because many of our costs are fixed  our margins depend on our volume of output at our facilities and a reduction in volume will adversely affect our margins 
if we are left with excess inventory  our operating results will be adversely affected 
because of long lead times and specialized product designs  we typically purchase components and manufacture products for customer orders or in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts 
for a variety of reasons  such as decreased end user demand for the products we are manufacturing  our customers may not purchase all of the products we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components 
in either event  we would attempt to recoup our materials and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors  disposing of excess inventory through other channels or requiring our oem customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory 
some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our oem customers to do this 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs  not only would our net sales be adversely affected  but also our operating results would be disproportionately adversely affected 
moreover  carrying excess inventory would reduce the working capital we have available to continue to operate and grow our business 
uncertainties and adverse trends affecting our industry or any of our major customers may adversely affect our operating results 
our business depends primarily on a specific segment of the electronics industry  medical instrumentation technology products  which is subject to rapid technological change and pricing and margin pressure 
this industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and production over capacity 
in addition  changes in government policy relating to reimbursement for the purchase and use of medical capital equipment could also affect our sales 
our customers markets are also subject to economic cycles and are likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting our industry  in general  or any of our major customers  in particular  may adversely affect our operating results 
our businesses outside the medical instrumentation technology product sector are subject to the same or greater technological and cyclical pressures 
our customers delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for their products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are used by a number of our customers in the production of medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight 
a delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a further risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices 
medical device products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
analogic s business strategy involves the pursuit of acquisitions or business combinations  which may be difficult to integrate  disrupt its business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
as part of its business strategy  analogic or its subsidiaries may consummate additional acquisitions or business combinations 
acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of analogic s ongoing business and distraction of management  expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
if analogic is not successful in completing acquisitions that it may pursue in the future  analogic may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions that will not generate benefits for it 
in addition  with future acquisitions  analogic could use substantial portions of its available cash as consideration for these acquisitions 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  which could affect the market price of our common stock 
our annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control  and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
these factors include variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  changes in demand for our customers existing products  the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor  and foreign currency exposure as is the case with many technology companies  we typically ship a significant portion of our products in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  any delay in anticipated sales is likely to result in the deferral of the associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter  which would have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter were below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  that revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their industry experience and their technological expertise 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and depend on the services of our key senior executives and our technological experts 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically engineering and operations personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in research and product development and manufacturing processes we will not be able to successfully compete 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to provide research and product development and manufacturing services that meet the changing needs of our customers 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
as a result  we continually evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new product design and manufacturing processes 
we cannot  however  assure you that our development efforts will be successful
