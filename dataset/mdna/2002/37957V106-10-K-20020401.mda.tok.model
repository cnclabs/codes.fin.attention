overview completion of merger with virata corporation on december   we completed a merger with virata under an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of october  under that agreement  a wholly owned subsidiary of our company merged with and into virata and virata became our wholly owned subsidiary 
at the effective time of the merger  we changed our name from globespan  inc to globespanvirata  inc 
the merger with virata was accounted for as a purchase  accordingly  operating results for virata have been included from the date of acquisition 
as a result of the merger with virata  each outstanding share of virata common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock or approximately million shares in the aggregate 
in addition  at that time  each then outstanding and unexercised stock option for shares of virata common stock  was converted into a stock option for our common stock  having the same terms and conditions  except that the number of shares the stock option related to was multiplied by for an aggregate of approximately million shares  and the exercise price was divided by 
in connection with the merger with virata  we formulated a reorganization and restructuring plan that was completed during the first quarter of as a result of the plan  we expect to record restructuring and other charges of million to million during the first quarter of additionally  we recognized as liabilities assumed in the purchase business combination and included in the allocation of the acquisition cost in accordance with sfas no 
 entitled business combinations and eitf  entitled recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  the estimated costs related to virata facilities consolidation and the related impact on the virata outstanding real estate leases and virata relocations and workforce reductions  which resulted from the reorganization plan 
we expect to obtain synergies of million to million beginning in these synergies will result from cost savings generated from the reorganization plan and building on the combined strengths of the merged entity 
general globespanvirata is a leading provider of integrated circuits  software and system designs for broadband communication applications that enable high speed transmission of data  voice and video to homes and business enterprises throughout the world 
currently  our integrated circuits  software and system designs are primarily used dsl applications  which utilize the existing network of copper telephone wires  known as the local loop  for high speed transmission of data 
we sell our products to more than telecommunications equipment manufacturers for incorporation into their products for use in systems deployed by telecommunications service providers and end users in more than countries 
historically  a significant portion of our net revenues in any quarter or annual period has been derived from sales to relatively few customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
in the years ended december   and  our customers who individually represented more than of our net revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of our net revenues 
in our top customers were lucent technologies and cisco systems  which accounted for and of our net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   on an unaudited pro forma combined basis  our top customers were lucent technologies  ambit microsystems and cisco systems  which accounted for  and of our combined net revenues  respectively 
the unaudited pro forma combined revenue includes revenues for the twelve month period ended december   as if the merger were consummated on january  in  our top customers were cisco systems  lucent technologies and nortel networks  which accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
in  our top customer was cisco systems which accounted for of our net revenues 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
because fluctuations in orders from our major customers could cause our net revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or annual period  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
members of the group comprising our largest customers are subject to frequent change due to our lack of long term contracts with our customers  the timing of our customers product implementations  demand cycles in the sales of our customers products and our long sales cycle 
in particular  the amount of revenues we derive from our customers depends upon their success in selling dsl equipment to telecommunications service providers for use in dsl service deployments 
our largest customers in any particular period have varied with the timing of dsl deployments and the identity of the telecommunications service provider initiating the deployment 
further  since we are a worldwide supplier  our net revenues and customers may be influenced by local economic conditions that influence our customers level of business with us 
our long sales cycle is another factor in the frequent change of our principal customers 
in general  our customers will evaluate our products for three to six months prior to incorporating our products into their products and beginning volume production 
as a result  our principal customers will vary depending on their stage in the sales cycle 
historically  a significant portion of our net revenues has been derived from customers outside of north america  and we expect this trend to continue 
net revenues from customers outside of north america are primarily due to the implementation of dsl in international markets and third party manufacturing of our customers product at locations outside of north america 
in  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and were derived from customers based in other international markets 
in  on an unaudited pro forma combined basis  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and 
from customers based in other international markets 
the unaudited pro forma combined revenue includes the revenues of globespan and virata for the twelve month period ended december  in  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and were derived from customers based in other international markets 
in  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and were derived from customers based in other international markets 
substantially all of our net revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
competition and technological change in the rapidly evolving dsl market has and may continue to influence our quarterly and annual net revenues and results of operations 
average selling prices of our chip sets and associated gross margins tend to be higher at the time we introduce new products and decline over time due to competitive pressures 
we expect this pattern to continue with existing and future products 
further  our gross margins are impacted by our customer concentration and product mix 
for example  purchases from our major customers are generally at lower average selling prices and certain of our products  such as discrete components  are generally lower margin products 
our product development and marketing strategy is focused on generating design wins with dsl equipment manufacturers 
the sales cycle for design wins includes detailed testing and evaluation of our products  followed by a customer product development cycle 
due to these cycles  which may be up to months or longer  and because the end user market for dsl services is an emerging market  we invest significant resources in research and development and marketing in advance of generating substantial revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
our backlog has fluctuated from quarter to quarter and has not been predictive of quarterly results 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect and we are unable to predict or adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses and inventory levels may increase as a percentage of net revenues and total assets  respectively 
our net losses have resulted from our significant investment in research and development  in building sales and marketing and general and administrative infrastructure  from the effects of purchase accounting for our acquisitions  as a result of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory and restructuring and other charges 
these expenses have exceeded our gross profits 
we expect to continue to invest significant resources in this infrastructure in advance of realizing revenues associated with these expenses 
each of the acquisitions we made in and was accounted for as a purchase acquisition 
under purchase accounting  we recorded the market value of our shares of common stock issued in connection with the purchases and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of acquiring the companies 
that cost was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various tangible and identifiable intangible assets such as in process research and development  acquired technology  acquired trademarks and trade names  based on their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets to goodwill 
we estimate that the amortization of intangible assets will result in annual amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges of approximately million  using useful lives of six months to four years 
as a result  purchase accounting treatment of our recent acquisitions will result in a net loss for the foreseeable future  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our stock 
we will continue to seek out other acquisition opportunities 
accordingly  we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
these estimates include assessing the collectability of accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the realizability of deferred tax assets  and useful lives or amortization periods of intangible assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the markets for our products are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological development and frequent new product introductions  all of which could impact the future realizability of our assets 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer  when the risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  price and terms are fixed  and when no significant vendor obligations exist and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as sales commissions 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
substantially all of our revenues for the years ended december   and were derived from product sales of our dsl semiconductor products 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory values and quantities on hand and write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of intangibles and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on current and estimated future profitability and undiscounted cash flows 
as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
 entitled goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal year  goodwill will no longer be amortized to the income statement 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and future impairment reviews  at least annually  thereafter 
as a result of our initial impairment review  we do not believe that any impairment charge is required 
however  there can be no assurance that a material impairment charge will not be required as a result of future annual reviews 
product warranties we provide purchasers of our products with certain warranties that correspond with the warranties from our contract manufacturers 
warranty expense has been immaterial for all periods presented 
however  there can be no assurance that warranty expense will not be material in future periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled accounting for income taxes  which requires use of the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
the reduction in the valuation allowance could have a material positive affect on our net results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  our effective tax rate would likely increase significantly in periods subsequent to the initial reversal of the valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statement of operations data 
our results of operations are reported as a single business segment

our net revenues were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent a decrease of from to  and an increase of from to the decrease in net revenues and net product revenues from to was primarily due to the overall slowdown in the telecommunications equipment market 
the increase in net revenues from to was primarily due to the increases in unit volume shipments to existing customers  the expansion of our customer base and the introduction of new products  and  to a lesser extent  net revenues from acquired businesses 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent a decrease of from to and an increase of from to our gross profit as a percentage of revenues was  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentage and dollars from to is primarily attributed to the increase in cost of sales resulting from the provision for excess and obsolete inventories  which we refer to as the provision  of million  net of the positive effect of million in cancellation revenues with minimal associated costs and million of product previously reserved 
excluding the provision  the cancellation revenues and associated costs and revenue from the sale of product previously reserved  our gross profit percentage was 
the decrease in gross profit percentage from in was related to lower average selling prices 
our gross profit dollars  excluding the provision  cancellation revenues and associated costs and revenue from the sale of product previously reserved  was million  a decrease of million from  which was the result of lower net product revenues 
we expect the gross profit percentage may decrease in the future due to anticipated reductions in average selling prices  revenue and product mix  and customer mix 
the decrease in gross profit percentage from to was related to lower average selling prices due to increased unit volume shipped 
the increase in gross profit dollars from to was the result of higher net revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenditures are comprised primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include related supplies  license fees for acquired technologies used in research and development  depreciation and amortization and other related equipment expenses 
our research and development expenditures were million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in research and development expenditures for the years ended december  and december  is million and million of non cash compensation 
during the years ended december  and  we exchanged our common stock with employee principals of an acquired entity which was considered compensation  we granted certain employees stock options at less than fair market value and we converted unvested options of acquired entities into globespanvirata options to purchase common stock 
the deferred stock compensation recorded is being amortized over the respective vesting periods ranging from six months to four years 
our research and development expenditures increased by excluding non cash compensation from to and by excluding non cash compensation from to the increase in research and development spending during and is attributable primarily to the increase in the number of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
research and development expenditures represented excluding non cash compensation  excluding non cash compensation and of net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues in was due to our decreased revenue 
the dollar amount of our research and development expense may increase in the future due to the merger with virata 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  general and administrative personnel as well as general non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in selling  general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and december  is and million of non cash compensation 
during the year ended december  and  we exchanged our common stock with employee principals of an acquired entity which was considered compensation  we granted certain employees stock options at less than fair market value  we converted unvested options of acquired entities into options to purchase common stock and we granted options to non employees 
the deferred stock compensation recorded is being amortized over the respective vesting periods ranging from six months to four years 
the non employee options were recorded as an expense when they were issued as the performance required to earn those options was complete 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by excluding non cash compensation from to and increased by excluding non cash compensation from to selling  general and administrative expense represented excluding non cash compensation  excluding non cash compensation and of net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in dollars from to resulted from the decrease in sales commissions as a result of lower product revenues and reductions in consulting and legal expenses 
the increase in dollars from to resulted from the increase in sales  marketing and administrative personnel and related expenses including expenses from our acquisitions 
the dollar amount of our selling  general and administrative expense may increase in the future due to the merger with virata 
in process research and development 
during the years ended december  and december   we completed the acquisition of several companies that had development projects which were not yet complete at the date of the acquisitions 
the amounts allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d  of million in and million in were expensed upon acquisition  as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technical feasibility  had no alternative future use and successful development was uncertain 
in the allocation of the acquisition purchase price to ipr d  consideration was given to the following for the projects under development at the time of acquisition o the present value of the forecasted cash flows and income that were expected to result from the project  o the status of the project  o completion costs  o project risks  o the value of core technology  and o the stage of completion of the project 
in valuing core technology  the relative allocations to core technology and ipr d were consistent with the relative contribution of the projects 
the determination of the value of ipr d was based on efforts completed as of the date the respective entities were acquired 
amortization of intangible assets 
during the years ended december  and december   we completed several acquisitions 
the increase in dollar amount and percentage of amortization expense is the result of our amortizing the intangible assets acquired on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
our expense for amortization was million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
restructuring and other charges 
due to changes in its business environment  we have taken steps to realign our operating cost structure  which have resulted in restructuring and other charges of million 
these charges primarily consist of costs related to facilities consolidation and the related impact on our outstanding real estate leases and workforce reductions 
the workforce reductions resulted in the involuntary severance of approximately employees or approximately of our overall workforce at the time and included employees across all disciplines and geographic regions 
substantially all of the affected employees ceased employment with us prior to june  the workforce reduction charge of million was based upon estimates of the severance and fringe benefits for the affected employees 
all of the payments related to the workforce reduction are expected to be made within one year 
the non cash workforce reduction charges pertain to modifications to the terms of the stock options previously granted to terminated employees and have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
as a result of the reduction in our workforce  we have consolidated our use of facilities  which had been leased in anticipation of continued short term growth  and are actively pursuing subleases for vacant space 
due to the decline in the real estate market in the geographic regions in which we are pursuing subleases  we have estimated our losses on these non cancelable lease commitments  including the write off of leasehold improvements and executory and other administrative costs to complete subleases  to be million 
these non cancelable lease commitments range from eighteen months to sixteen years in length 
if we are unable to execute a sublease agreement within the estimated time frame for each facility  we could incur additional charges or operating expenses in the future 
other charges consisted primarily of the write off of certain investments  which the company deemed to have an other than temporary decline in fair value 
interest expense non cash 
as part of the purchase price for the microelectronics group of pairgain technologies  in  we issued a subordinated redeemable convertible note  which we refer to as the pairgain note  with a beneficial conversion feature measured by the price of our common stock at closing of the acquisition and the conversion price as defined 
we amortized the difference between the price of our common stock at the closing of the acquisition and the conversion price of approximately million through august   the date we repaid the pairgain note 
the increase in dollar amount and percentage is the result of the amortization 
interest income  net 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  which resulted from interest income of million  net of interest expense of million 
the decrease in net interest income from to was a result of an increase in interest expense on our million subordinated redeemable convertible notes issued in may of  offset by higher interest income from the funds received as a result of the issuance of the may convertible notes 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  offset by interest expense of million  resulting in net interest income of million 
the increase in interest income  net of 
million from to  was primarily the result of higher cash balances during  and a reduction in interest expense from outstanding debt  offset by million of interest expense related to the pairgain note 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the effective rate is impacted by permanent differences which resulted from our acquisitions and a change in the valuation allowance  net of acquired valuation allowances and differences resulting from acquisitions 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was  excluding the tax effect of non cash interest expense and the extraordinary gain related to the pairgain note 
the effective rate was impacted by permanent differences which resulted from our acquisitions  and an increase in the valuation allowance 
extraordinary gain 
in connection with the repayment of the pairgain note  we recognized a gain of million for the year ending december  on the redemption of the beneficial conversion feature 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 entitled accounting for certain hedging activities  which amended sfas no 
 entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
other charges of million  consist primarily of the write off of certain investments for which we believe a permanent impairment of value has occurred 
we adopted these statements effective january  these statements establish methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
because we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of these statements did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 entitled business combinations and sfas no 
 entitled goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting for business combinations by requiring that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method be used for business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be subject to amortization  with related charges to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
we will adopt the statement and cease amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions prior to june   effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
will result in a significant reduction to amortization expense in future periods 
in august  sfas no 
 entitled accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued  replacing fas no 
 entitled accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion  entitled reporting the results of operations 
fas no 
provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
retains the requirement of apb opinion  to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
is effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets at december  were  million  an increase of million  or from december  total assets of million 
the increase from december  is primarily a result of an increase in cash and investments as a result of our merger with virata 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  of which million was in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  of which million was in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december  net cash received from the acquisition of virata of million  was offset by purchases of property and equipment and net purchases of marketable securities for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december  net cash received from the acquisition of businesses of million  proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of million and the sale of an intangible asset of 
million  were offset by purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities of million and million  respectively for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december  the net cash used primarily related to investments in marketable securities and preferred stock during the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  primarily consisted of borrowings under the subordinated redeemable convertible note  net of offering costs  of million  and net proceeds from the issuances of common stock of million offset by million in repayments of capital lease obligations 
cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  primarily consisted of net proceeds from a follow on public offering and other proceeds from the issuances of common stock of million  offset by a million repayment of the pairgain note and other miscellaneous items 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december and was provided by the issuance of common and preferred stock  and other debt and bank borrowings 
we lease certain facilities for office and research and development activities under agreements that expire at various dates through in addition  we lease certain computer and office equipment under agreements that are classified as capital leases  the net book value of which was million and million at december  and  respectively 
minimum required future lease payments under our capital and operating leases at december  are as follows following table in thousands capital operating leases leases years ended december  thereafter  total minimum lease payments   less amount representing interest present value of net minimum lease payments  less current portion  approximately million of the operating lease commitments will be paid beyond ten years 
on may   we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due in a private placement through an initial purchaser to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with rule a under the securities act 
these notes are unsecured obligations of our company and will mature on may  interest on the notes is payable semi annually 
holders of these notes may convert the notes into shares of common stock at any time prior to maturity at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to may  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price of the notes for at least of the trading days prior to the mailing of the redemption notice  and in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement we executed at the time we issued the notes  the shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is effective and available for use and expected to remain effective and available for use for the days following the provisional redemption date 
in the event of a provisional redemption  we will make an additional payment equal to the total value of the aggregate amount of the interest that would have been payable on the notes from the redemption date to may  on and after may   we may also redeem the notes at any time at our option  in whole or in part  at the redemption price shown in the note  plus accrued interest  if any 
in february of we purchased a  square foot building in old bridge  new jersey 
we paid cash of approximately million and expect to incur approximately million during to complete construction of the interior of the building 
we believe that our sources of capital  including internally generated funds and the cash and investments acquired as a result of our merger with virata  will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least one year 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital for the acquisition of businesses and products and technologies that are complementary to ours 
further  if we issue equity securities  the ownership percentage of our stockholders would be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we can not raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   substantially all of our short term investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposit  or high quality commercial paper 
long term securities are primarily comprised of aa or better corporate bonds and us government backed securities
