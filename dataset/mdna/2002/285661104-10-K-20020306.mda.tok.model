results of operations consolidated revenues 
the following table displays revenues from contracts with our base non gm clients and revenues from contracts with gm dollars in millions revenues base gm total total revenues increased billion  or  in to billion when compared with billion in revenues from base clients increased billion  or  to billion in primarily due to contracts signed in and with new and existing clients and revenues associated with acquisitions completed in  partially offset by revenues associated with the divestiture of our canadian based hardware reseller unit in excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  base revenue increased on a constant foreign currency basis 
revenues from gm decreased million  or  in primarily due to gm s decision to tighten discretionary spending due to the current state of the worldwide economy and the automotive marketplace 
we expect gm to continue to focus on reductions in discretionary spending in early  and we estimate our revenues from gm will decline in the low double digits in early on a constant foreign currency basis and may continue to decline at this rate subject to gm s continued focus on discretionary spending 
revenues from both gm and base clients were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations during  due primarily to the relative decline of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar 
on a constant foreign currency basis  total revenues in increased over  resulting from an increase of in revenues from base clients and a decline of in revenues from gm 
other than gm  no one client accounted for more than of our total revenues in  or total revenues increased million  or  in to billion when compared with billion in revenues from base clients increased million  or  to billion in primarily due to new contract signings  as well as from the full year revenues attributable to systemhouse  which was acquired in april the increase in base revenues in was partially offset by decreases resulting from the divestiture during of certain business units and the discontinuation of certain contracts to align service offerings with our global lines of business to capture synergies and further leverage our delivery platforms 
see restructuring activities and other charges below 
revenues from gm decreased million  or  in primarily due to the renegotiation of our sector agreements with gm covering its north american operations and gmac  which became effective january  the remainder of the decline was due primarily to foreign currency fluctuations

asset write downs related to the restructuring activities consisted of million to write off software  goodwill and other intangibles  and million for write downs of computer related equipment and other assets 
such asset write downs predominantly related to businesses that we had decided to exit in each of our lines of business and were primarily determined based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
during the year ended december   we reversed restructuring accruals totaling million  million of which was attributable to the initiatives begun in the first quarter of  the remainder of which was attributable to the and restructuring initiatives as discussed below 
as a result of our ongoing evaluation of the results to date of the initiatives begun in  we amended some of the original plans in the fourth quarter of due to actual attrition rates for job categories and or geographies differing from original expectations 
these amendments consisted primarily of plans to involuntarily terminate employees different from those originally planned 
due to the specific requirements to detail both the type of position and location of the workplace when recording a restructuring charge  these amendments resulted in the reversal of a portion of the charge associated with the original plan  representing approximately  of the original positions  and the recognition of a charge associated with the new plan 
as a result of the new plan  we recorded restructuring charges and asset write downs totaling million in the fourth quarter of the financial impact resulting from the new plan was more than offset by the reversal of accruals of million related to restructuring charges previously recorded in  resulting in a net reversal of restructuring charges of million for amounts recorded for restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of provide for workforce reductions of approximately  employees  consisting of individuals employed throughout the company in managerial  professional  clerical  consulting and technical positions

in addition  million has been paid in connection with the exit activities described above

the effective income tax rates in  and were   and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in and was due to acquired in process r d  which is not deductible in the computation of the provision for income taxes

our revenues and net income vary over the calendar year  with the fourth quarter generally reflecting the highest revenues and net income for the year due to certain services that are purchased more heavily in that quarter as a result of the spending patterns of several clients 
in addition  revenues generally increase from quarter to quarter as a result of new business added throughout the year 
inflation generally had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
results of operations segments we are organized on a global basis along the following five lines of business information solutions  bpm  e solutions  at kearney and plm solutions 
our e solutions and at kearney lines of business constitute the consulting reportable segment

the plm solutions segment reports revenues and operating income of non us operations using actual currency exchange rates 
the all other category also includes corporate expenses

the decrease in revenues in the all other category in was primarily due to the relative decline of the euro and the british pound against their respective fixed currency exchange rates 
operating income 
management uses operating income  which consists of segment revenues less segment costs and expenses before acquired in process r d and other acquisitions costs and restructuring and other charges to measure segment profit or loss

financial position assets 
total assets increased to billion at december   up from billion at december  the increase in total assets is primarily comprised of a billion increase in software  goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions and a million increase in unbilled revenue related to our percentage of completion contracts 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million  had working capital of billion and a current ratio of to this compares with cash and cash equivalents of million  billion in working capital  and a current ratio of to at december  in addition  our days sales outstanding at december  increased to days compared with days at december   primarily due to the increase in unbilled revenue somewhat offset by a decrease in outstanding trade receivables 
liabilities and shareholders equity 
total debt increased to billion at december   from billion at december  total debt consists of notes payable  commercial paper and redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries 
this increase was primarily due to our billion public offering of securities in june and our million offering of zero coupon convertible senior notes in october  both described below  and was partially offset by the redemption of our redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries 
proceeds from the securities and notes offerings were primarily used to fund our recent acquisitions 
the total debt to capital ratio which includes total debt and minority interests as components of capital increased to at december  compared with at december  credit rating agencies make various adjustments in computing our debt to capital and other key financial ratios 
at december  and  our long term credit ratings were a by moody s investors service  inc  a by standard poor s ratings services and aa by fitch 
in june  we completed the public offering of million units of a security  each with a stated price of before underwriting discount 
each unit initially consists of principal amount of eds senior notes due august  and a purchase contract which obligates the investor to purchase of eds common stock no later than august at a price ranging from to per share 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  which is expected to be reset on or after may and are contingently redeemable at that time 
contract adjustment payments are payable to the holders of purchase contracts at a fixed rate of per year 
the present value of the contract adjustment payments of million and issuance costs of million were accrued upon issuance and recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
net proceeds from the offering of billion were used to fund acquisitions during in october  we completed the public offering of million zero coupon convertible senior notes due october  each note was issued at a price of and has a principal amount at maturity of  holders may convert each note on or before the maturity date into shares of eds common stock when the average per share sale price of eds common stock is at least a specified percentage  beginning at and declining each year thereafter  above the accreted value of a note original note proceeds plus interest earned to date divided by 
the notes may also be converted if our debt rating falls below investment grade  we call the notes for redemption  make specified shareholder distributions or become party to a merger pursuant to which eds common stock would be converted into cash  securities or other property 
in lieu of delivering shares of common stock  we may elect to pay holders cash for their notes 
the issue price per note represents a yield to maturity of per year calculated from october commencing with the six month period beginning october  the notes will accrue contingent interest if the average market price of the notes equals or more of the accreted value of the note 
the amount of contingent interest payable per note is equal to the greater of of the market price of the note or the equivalent cash dividends paid per share of common stock during the related six month period multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a note 
at any time on or after october  we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash in an amount equal to the accreted value of the notes plus unpaid contingent interest  if any 
holders may require us to redeem their notes at the accreted value of the note for cash on october   or for any combination of cash or eds common stock  at our option  on october    and net proceeds from the offering of million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our commercial paper and other short term debt facilities which had been utilized to fund acquisitions during liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities increased million in primarily due to an increase in net income 
net cash used in investing activities increased billion in primarily due to payments related to acquisitions and capital expenditures related to technical infrastructure upgrades and certain new large client contracts  somewhat offset by proceeds from sales of investments and other assets and a decrease in payments for purchases of software 
free cash flow  measured as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities excluding those related to acquisitions  divestitures and marketable securities  was million in net cash provided by financing activities increased to billion in compared with net cash used in financing activities of million in primarily due to net proceeds from long term debt in  partially offset by a net decrease in borrowings with original maturities less than days and the redemption of the preferred stock of a subsidiary 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in primarily due to changes in working capital items  partially offset by an increase in net income 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million in primarily due to payments in related to the acquisition of systemhouse  partially offset by reduced proceeds from investments and other assets and an increase in payments for purchases of software and other intangibles in free cash flow was million in net cash used in financing activities decreased million in primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and a net increase in borrowings with original maturities less than days  partially offset by an increase in net payments on long term debt 
our principal source of liquidity is cash flow from operations 
at december   we had committed lines of credit of approximately billion  all unused  which serve as a backup facility for commercial paper borrowings 
we do not rely on our commercial paper facilities as a principal source of liquidity 
we generally utilize those facilities to manage short term working capital fluctuations and to temporarily finance strategic transactions until that debt can be replaced by a longer term facility 
we believe it is unlikely that rating agencies would take any action that would materially impact the cost or our ability to issue commercial paper  or the cost or availability of committed lines of credit 
in connection with certain service contracts  we may arrange a client supported financing transaction csft with our client and an independent third party financial institution or its designee or a securitization transaction where we sell certain financial assets resulting from the related service contract 
the use of these transactions enables us to offer clients more favorable financing terms 
these transactions also enable the preservation of our capital resources and allow us to avoid client credit risk relating to the repayment of the financed amounts 
under csft arrangements  the independent third party financial institution finances the purchase of certain it related assets and simultaneously leases those assets for use in connection with the service contract 
the use of a csft on a service contract results in lower contract revenue and expense to eds over the contract term 
under a securitization transaction  we purchase capital assets and sell certain financial assets resulting from the related service contract to a trust trust 
at december   the trust was capitalized with external borrowings of million and our residual beneficial interest of million 
we have no effective control over the activities of the trust  and it is legally isolated from eds 
in the csft and securitization transactions  client payments are made directly to the financial institution or trust providing the financing 
if the client does not make the required payments under the service contract  under no circumstances do we have an ultimate obligation to acquire the underlying assets unless our nonperformance under the service contract would permit its termination  or we fail to comply with certain customary terms under the financing agreements  including  for example  covenants we have undertaken regarding the use of the assets for their intended purpose 
we consider the likelihood of our failure to comply with any of these terms to be remote 
with respect to csfts  even in the event of nonperformance under applicable contracts which would permit their termination  we would have no additional or incremental performance risk with respect to the ownership of the assets  because we would have owned or leased the same or substantially equivalent assets in order to fulfill our obligations under our service contracts 
with respect to the securitization transaction  even in the event of termination due to our nonperformance  in which case we would have an obligation to acquire the underlying assets  we would have a legal claim against the client to recover the amount paid to acquire such assets 
performance under our service contracts is generally measured by contract terms relating to project deadlines  it system deliverables or level of effort measurements 
we reduce the risk of contract termination due to nonperformance through the use of a defined risk identification  review and mitigation process 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a related csft or securitization transaction 
since january   we have signed new service contracts having a total contract revenue value of billion over their terms 
during this period  a total of billion of assets have been purchased using the financing arrangements referred to above 
at december   the estimated future asset purchases that can be financed under existing financing arrangements are billion 
the aggregate dollar value of assets purchased under these financing transactions during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in these financing transactions during the years ended december  and is a result of the increase in large it outsourcing contract signings during these years 
as of december   there was outstanding an aggregate of million under csfts yet to be paid by our clients 
as of december   there were outstanding million of financial assets securitized by eds yet to be paid by our client 
in the event a contract may be terminated due to nonperformance  we would be required to acquire only those assets associated with the outstanding amounts for that contract 
net of repayments  the estimated future maximum amount outstanding under existing financing arrangements is not expected to exceed billion 
we have sufficient alternative sources of liquidity to directly finance the purchase of it capital assets to be used for service contracts with or without the use of these transactions 
the following table summarizes csft and securitization financing activities since january  in millions total csft securitization financings arranged estimated amounts not yet drawn total amount drawn amount repaid total outstanding at december  in the normal course of business  we may provide certain customers with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  which we believe is remote 
we believe we are in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee and the ultimate liability  if any  incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the following table summarizes the estimated expiration of financial guarantees outstanding as of december  in millions estimated expiration per period total thereafter performance guarantees csft transactions securitization transactions standby letters of credit  surety bonds and other other guarantees total in order to obtain favorable pricing and commercial terms for services necessary for the ongoing operation of our business  we have signed long term purchase agreements with certain software and telecommunications services providers 
under the terms of these agreements  we are contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over the next years 
if we fail to purchase the contractual minimums we have an obligation to pay the service provider all or a portion of the shortfall 
we believe these obligations will be met through the normal course of business 
the following tables summarize debt  lease and minimum purchase obligations outstanding as of december  in millions commitment per period total thereafter long term non convertible debt maturities operating lease payments minimum purchase obligations total zero coupon convertible senior notes includes one agreement representing million of the aggregate balance  which requires eds to maintain an investment grade debt rating 
in the unlikely event we were to become out of compliance with this requirement and a waiver is not granted  the remaining minimum purchase commitment would become due immediately 
as of december   our debt ratings by moody s a  standard poors a and fitch aa were well within the investment grade scale 
notes are due  but are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the holder for cash in  or for any combination of cash or eds common stock  at our option  in   and we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures and working capital 
capital expenditures may consist of purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment  software  land  buildings and facilities  as well as acquisitions and joint ventures 
we estimate projected gross capital expenditures during  excluding acquisition and joint venture activities as well as proceeds from divestitures  will be approximately billion 
total capital expenditures for will depend to a significant extent on the level of additional acquisition and joint venture activities  capital requirements for new business  and proceeds from divestitures 
we anticipate that cash reserves  cash flows from operations and unused borrowing capacity under the existing lines of credit and client financing transactions will provide sufficient funds to meet our needs during market risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments  are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the issuance of short term commercial paper and variable rate notes 
however  the effects of interest rate changes are reduced by our management of our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments as well as the utilization of interest rate swaps 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had short term market interest rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
publicly traded equity price sensitivity 
our financial position is affected by changes in publicly traded equity prices as a result of certain investments 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in the value of our publicly traded equity security investments 
if the market price of our investments in publicly traded equity securities in were to fall by below the level at the end of  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  declines in the market price of our publicly traded equity securities did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operation or financial position 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct business in the united states and around the world 
our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to canada  the united kingdom  western european countries that use the euro as a common currency  australia and new zealand 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against foreign currency exchange risk from intercompany financing and trading transactions 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with durations of generally less than days to hedge such transactions 
we have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
generally  foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had foreign currency rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long term assets  income tax recognition of deferred tax items and accruals for loss contracts and contingencies 
our policy and related procedures for revenue recognition on long term service contracts are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we provide services under time and material  unit price  or fixed price contracts which generally extend up to years 
under time and material and certain unit price and fixed price contracts under which costs are generally incurred in proportion with contracted billing schedules  revenue is recognized when the customer may be billed 
such method is expected to result in reasonably consistent profit margins over the contract term 
for certain unit price and fixed price contracts  we follow the guidance contained in aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that contain enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the contracting parties  consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement  assuming reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and expenses can be made 
the percentage of completion methodology generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract 
amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
if sufficient risk exists  a zero profit methodology is applied to a specific client contract s percentage of completion model whereby the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of costs incurred until such time as the risks have been partially or wholly mitigated through performance 
this methodology is primarily used at the inception of our largest outsourcing contracts where the amount of profit to be recognized on a contract over its term is not yet determinable 
our estimates of revenues and expenses on client contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
in addition  the implementation of cost saving initiatives and achievement of productivity gains generally results in a reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
for client contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  such changes would be reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
for all client contracts  provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used and establishes new standards on the recognition of certain identifiable intangible assets separate from goodwill for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective july  and will fully adopt sfas no 
effective january  in accordance with the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill that was acquired in purchase business combinations completed after june  is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment in accordance with the accounting literature in effect prior to the issuance of sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  continue to be amortized through december  under sfas no 
 we are required to perform transitional impairment tests for our goodwill and certain intangible assets as of the date of adoption 
the transitional impairment test for these intangible assets will be completed by march  step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test  which compares the fair values of our reporting units to their respective carrying values  will be completed by june  transitional impairment losses for goodwill and these certain intangibles  if any  will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of income 
we have determined net income per share as adjusted to exclude amortization expense  net of tax effects  on goodwill and intangible assets which are no longer being amortized would increase by approximately and per share for and  respectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the transitional impairment requirements of this standard on our results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the requirements and impact of this standard  but its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation requirements of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  relative to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard  but the impact of its adoption  if any  is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position
