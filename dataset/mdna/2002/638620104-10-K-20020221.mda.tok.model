risk factors in item operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or less than  in as compared to the increase was primarily a result of one development completed during  a full year of revenues earned by investments in additional facilities in and the conversion of three facilities from mortgage loans receivable to ownership 
the increase was offset by the disposal of facilities during the year  eleven of which were sold in the fourth quarter  and a reduction of the rent at certain facilities related to the settlement with certain operators in bankruptcy proceedings as discussed below 
interest and other income decreased by  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff at par of mortgage loans receivable totaling approximately  secured by five facilities  the conversion of three facilities and four land parcels totaling approximately  from mortgage loans receivable to ownership mentioned above and amortization of notes receivable 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in overall debt levels accomplished with the funds received from the facility sales and mortgage loan receivable payoffs discussed above and decreases in the average interest rates on our  bank line of credit 
the decrease was partially offset by a reduction in interest capitalized on construction projects 
depreciation and non cash charges increased  or less than  in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation on the development completed in and the three facilities converted from mortgage loans receivable to ownership and a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in the increase was offset by the disposal of facilities during the year 
general and administrative costs increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to increases in legal fees and other costs related to five operators in bankruptcy discussed below and general cost increases 
we recorded a net gain of  in related to the disposal of skilled nursing facilities  two residential care facilities for the elderly and one assisted living facility during the year 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of assets charge of  this charge included  related to the write down of three skilled nursing facilities to their fair value less costs to sell  the provision of a reserve against mortgage loans receivable of  and  of receivable write offs and reserves against other assets which we believe may have become impaired 
we expect to receive increased rent and interest at individual facilities because our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
historically  revenues at our facilities and the consumer price index generally have increased  although there are no assurances that they will continue to increase in the future 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgages would serve to offset the aforementioned revenue increases  and if sales and repayments exceed additional investments this would actually reduce revenues 
there is no assurance that leases will renew at the aggregate existing rent level  so the impact of lease renewals may cause a decrease in the total rent we receive 
additional investments in healthcare facilities would increase rental and or interest income 
as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by rent or interest income associated with the investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily a result of the five developments completed during  combined with a full year of revenues earned from investments in additional facilities in interest and other income increased by  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to increases in additional interest based on increases in the facility revenues or the consumer price index pursuant to our existing mortgage loans receivable and interest income on a note received from beverly enterprises  inc in as part of a lease settlement  partially offset by the payoff of a mortgage loan receivable and the partial payoff of another mortgage loan receivable during the year 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  in fixed rate medium term notes during  the interest on which is now included for a full year  increases in the average interest rates on our  bank line of credit and a reduction in interest capitalized on construction projects  partially offset by the repayment of  of fixed rate medium term notes during the year 
depreciation and non cash charges increased  or  in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation on the developments completed in  a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in  partially offset by the disposal of facilities during general and administrative costs increased  or  in as compared to due to increases in legal fees related to the three operators in bankruptcy at that time  general cost increases and additional costs associated with our larger asset base 
information regarding certain operators over leveraging and changes in reimbursement levels during had an adverse impact on the financial performance of some of the companies that operate nursing homes we own 
in addition  overbuilding in the assisted living sector has resulted in lower than anticipated fill rates and rental rates for some of the companies that operate assisted living facilities owned by us 
five of the companies that operate our facilities have filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
the table below summarizes  for the four operators of nursing homes  the filing dates of the bankruptcies  the number of our owned facilities operated by each operator at december   our investment in facilities subject to the bankruptcies at december   the percentage of our revenues for relating to the facilities operated by each operator at december  and cash deposits and letters of credit currently held by us as security for each operator 
the fifth operator in bankruptcy  assisted living concepts  inc alc  which operates assisted living facilities  filed for bankruptcy on october  and emerged effective january  at december  we leased two buildings and provided two mortgage loans secured by two buildings to alc that represented less than of our revenues and our total investments at december  as part of our arrangement with alc  as of january   the titles to the two buildings previously securing the mortgage loans were transferred to us in satisfaction of the mortgages and we now lease all four buildings to alc under a master lease 
the new rental rate on these facilities will result in a reduction in income of approximately  starting in operator bankruptcy filing date number of facilities operated investment in facilities percentage of revenue security deposits integrated health services  inc february  mariner post acute network  inc january  sun healthcare group  inc october  sv home office  inc and certain of its affiliates november  totals under bankruptcy statutes  the tenant must either assume our leases or reject them and return the properties to us 
if the tenant assumes the leases  it is required to assume the leases under the existing terms  the court cannot change the rental amount or other lease provisions that could financially impact us 
the tenant s decision whether to assume leases is usually based primarily on whether the properties that are operated by the tenant are providing positive cash flows 
only a few of the remaining facilities leased to and operated by these four companies that have not been assumed are not providing adequate cash flows on their own to cover the rent under the leases 
our rent has been paid each month on a timely basis 
nevertheless  there is a possibility that the tenants may decide to reject the leases on these properties  and while we have identified parties interested in leasing these facilities  any new leases may be at a lower rental rate 
mariner post acute network  inc mariner has assumed the leases on six of the seven facilities it currently leases from us 
it has returned facilities to us to date  all of which have been leased to new operators 
the leases for eleven of the returned facilities are at rates substantially consistent with what was previously received from mariner  however  the leases for the other three facilities are at significantly lower rental rates 
sun healthcare group  inc sun has not assumed any of the six facilities it currently leases from us 
it has returned facilities to us to date  of which have been leased to new operators  one of which has been sold and one of which is not currently leased 
the leases on the buildings that have been leased to new operators are substantially consistent with what was previously received from sun 
we expect the net rate reduction on the facilities returned and those we believe may be returned by mariner and sun to result in a decrease in income of approximately  on an annualized basis  approximately  of which is reflected in the financial statements for the year ended december  we are currently in negotiations with integrated health services  inc integrated regarding their portfolio 
we expect them to return two facilities to us  to assume the lease on one facility and we expect to recognize a negotiated reduction in rent on the four remaining leases we expect them to keep 
we anticipate the result of the above items related to integrated to result in a decrease in income of approximately  starting in sv home office  inc and certain of its affiliates sv have returned one facility to us that we disposed of in january and we have agreed to allow them to continue to lease the remaining facility 
the returned facility will result in a reduction in income of approximately  in we recorded a charge of approximately  related to the write down of the facility sv returned to us 
this amount was included in the impairment of assets line in our income statement for in addition to the above  we have one mortgage loan directly with mariner with a principal balance of  that is secured by one facility 
the revenues from this mortgage loan represent approximately 
of our revenues for the year ended december  the mortgage loan is secured by a cash deposit in the amount of  we have not received any payments on this mortgage loan subsequent to march we also have one mortgage loan directly with sv with a principal balance of  that is secured by two facilities 
the revenues from this mortgage loan represent less than 
of our revenues for the year ended december  we have agreed to extend this mortgage loan for five years to december the mortgage is current based on the extended term we have agreed to 
under bankruptcy statutes  the court imposes an automatic stay with respect to our actions to collect or pursue remedies with respect to mortgage loans and we are precluded from exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower 
unlike a lease  a mortgage loan is not subject to assumption or rejection 
the mortgage loan may be divided into i a secured loan for the portion of the mortgage loan that does not exceed the value of the property and ii an unsecured loan for the portion of the mortgage loan that exceeds the value of the property  which unsecured portion would be treated like general unsecured claims in the bankruptcy estate 
we would only be entitled to the recovery of interest and costs if and to the extent that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed 
in addition  the courts may modify the terms of a mortgage  including the rate of interest and timing of principal payments 
in december  balanced care corporation bcc notified us that it would only be making a partial payment of its december rent 
at the time  we leased ten facilities in six states to bcc under two master leases 
the facilities were constructed and opened during and with an aggregate investment of approximately  we immediately declared bcc in default under its master leases and initiated steps to terminate the leases 
bcc agreed to return the facilities to us and the leases were terminated effective as of january  we have leased the facilities to a new operator effective april  at straight lined lease rates comparable to those previously paid by bcc of approximately  per month 
bcc managed the facilities on an interim basis on our behalf until we had a new operator with licenses in place 
we utilized the forfeited cash security deposits totaling approximately  to cover the majority of the rent from december through march during  we recognized revenues related to these buildings in excess of cash received of approximately  in general  the replacement of operators that have defaulted on lease or loan obligations could be delayed by the approval process of any regulatory agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to operate the facility 
liquidity and capital resources during  we completed the construction of one assisted living facility in which our aggregate investment was approximately  upon completion of construction  the facility was leased under terms generally similar to our existing leases 
during this period  we also funded approximately  in capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with certain existing lease provisions 
such capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents we earn on these facilities 
we funded the construction advances and capital improvements with borrowings on our bank line of credit and cash on hand 
during  we sold skilled nursing facilities  our final two residential care facilities for the elderly and one assisted living facility in twelve separate transactions for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately  we recognized an aggregate gain of  related to the disposal of these facilities 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings on our bank line of credit 
during  we provided a mortgage loan secured by one skilled nursing facility in the amount of  in addition  we funded an additional  on existing mortgage loans 
such additional amounts funded will result in an increase in the interest income we earn on these mortgages 
we funded these mortgage loans with borrowings on our bank line of credit and cash on hand 
during  two mortgage loans receivable with an aggregate net book value of approximately  secured by two skilled nursing facilities were repaid at par 
in addition  portions of two mortgage loans receivable totaling  secured by three skilled nursing facilities were also repaid 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings on our bank line of credit 
during  we obtained  of mortgage financing for ten years at a rate secured by four assisted living facilities 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings on our bank line of credit 
during  we repaid  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes 
the notes bore fixed interest at a weighted average interest rate of 
we funded the repayment with borrowings on our bank line of credit  cash on hand and the issuance of  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature on march  we have  of medium term notes maturing in that we anticipate repaying with a combination of borrowings on our bank line of credit  cash on hand  potential mortgage loans receivable payoffs and asset sales  the potential issuance of common stock  the issuance of additional medium term notes under the shelf registrations discussed below or cash from operations 
at year end we had the availability under our bank line of credit to repay the entire  coming due in our medium term notes have been investment grade rated since our current ratings are baa from moody s  bbb from standard poor s and bbb from fitch 
at december   we had  available under our  unsecured bank line of credit 
at our option  borrowings under the bank line of credit bear interest at prime or at libor plus 
we pay a facility fee of 
per annum on the total commitment under the bank line of credit 
under covenants contained in the credit agreement  we are required to maintain  among other things i a minimum net worth of  ii a ratio of cash flow before interest expense and non cash expenses to regularly scheduled debt service payments on all debt of at least to  iii a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of not more than to  and iv a gross asset value coverage ratio of at least to during  we issued one million shares of common stock at per share to two mutual funds advised by cohen steers capital management  inc the issuance of the shares did not involve any underwriting fees 
we recorded the stock issuance net of approximately  of legal and accounting fees related to the issuance and sale of the securities 
the proceeds received were used to repay borrowings on our bank line of credit 
we have shelf registrations on file with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue a up to  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes and b up to  of securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
we did not utilize any off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any unconsolidated subsidiaries at december   or during the year then ended 
during we entered into a joint venture with an institutional investor that may invest up to  in health care facilities similar to those already owned by us 
we anticipate that the venture would be funded by cash from the institutional investor and us and by non recourse secured debt 
we expect to be a equity partner in the venture and therefore would have a total cash commitment of  no investments were made by or into this venture during while this will be an off balance sheet arrangement if we choose to utilize it in  we expect its leverage to be no more than and we expect to provide disclosure adequate to facilitate an analysis of the venture s independent financing and operating activities and their impact on the company 
we have historically deferred rent for the first several months of a lease for buildings we have constructed with the amount deferred to be repaid over the remainder of the term 
during we began  in certain instances  to provide similar terms for leases on buildings that we have taken or received back from certain operators 
we recognized approximately   and  of revenues in excess of cash rent received during  and  respectively and there is approximately  and  of deferred rent recorded under the caption other assets on the balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
the ultimate amount we realize could be less than amounts recorded at december  we anticipate making additional investments in healthcare related facilities during  although the level of our new investments has been depressed during the last two years 
during that time we have not been making significant additional investments beyond our actual commitments because access to long term capital was not available under favorable terms 
the common stock issuance during the second quarter of may indicate that our ability to access capital and fund investments may be improving 
financing for future investments may be provided by borrowings under our bank line of credit  private placements or public offerings of debt or equity  the assumption of secured indebtedness  obtaining mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we anticipate the repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of certain facilities during in the event that there are mortgage loan receivable repayments or facility sales in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any mortgage loan receivable repayments or facility sales to reduce the outstanding balance on our bank line of credit  to repay other borrowings as they mature or to provide capital for future investments 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations was issued 
this pronouncement supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
we will adopt sfas no 
for all business combinations initiated after june  in june  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was issued 
this pronouncement changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment approach 
we do not presently have any goodwill recorded and do not believe that this pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
this pronouncement supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and a portion of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and will become effective for us on january  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
as it relates to assets to be held and used and assets to be sold  but adds provisions for assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
it also changes the accounting for the disposal of a segment under apb no 
by requiring the operations of any assets with their own identifiable cash flows that are disposed of or held for sale to be removed from operating income and reported as discontinued operations 
treating such assets as discontinued operations would also require the reclassification of the operations of any such assets for any prior periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations 
market risk exposure we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our mortgage loans receivable and debt 
we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in the market risk exposure paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading 
statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
we provide mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of our normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
three of our mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rates are equal to the then current rates 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate bank line of credit to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain healthcare facilities 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the rent received by us on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with our variable rate secured debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate bank borrowings average interest rate decreases in interest rates during resulted in a decrease in interest expense related to our bank line of credit 
these interest rate decreases have made it less expensive for us to borrow on our bank line of credit 
any future interest rate increases will increase the cost of borrowings on our bank line of credit  any borrowings to refinance long term debt as it matures or finance future acquisitions
