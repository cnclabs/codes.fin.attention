the following discussion and analysis shall be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto initiated in item financial statements and supplementary data 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease resulted primarily from decreases in product support services of million  leasing operations of million  technical staffing services of million  system integration services of million  and training services of million offset  in part  by increases in corporate help desk services of million 
product support service revenues were down due largely to the company selling its interest in the ge joint venture and ceasing to provide personnel services to the new owner of the joint venture in revenues from leasing operations decreased primarily due to the company s decision to cease looking for new leasing opportunities 
systems integration revenues decreased due mainly to a reduction in computer upgrade and installation work at an automotive client as well as the completion of systems work at two smaller customers in technical staffing revenues decreased in large part due to the company s two major automotive customers making cuts in subcontracted staffing to reduce their cost structure 
training revenues decreased mostly due to the discontinuance of the company s training contract with sun microsystems  inc and a reduction in services provided to one of the company s major automotive customers 
corporate help desk revenues increased principally due to new business with a company in the pharmaceutical industry commencing in and increased business with one of the company s major automotive customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in the decrease was due to a series of factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  a net loss from the sale of equipment coming off lease of million in as compared to a gain of million in  an increase of the company s residual reserve by million to million and the reduction in revenues  all in the leasing operations  a reduction in revenues in the product support services  and a reduction of gross profit margin in the corporate help desk segment due primarily to the effects of a th quarter acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million in includes a net settlement of  related to earn out and release agreements with former officers of techteam capital group  severance payments of  for administrative employees that were terminated  write offs of  for remaining goodwill and equity interest of prior acquisitions determined to be impaired  an  loss on disposal of assets due to the closing of a call center office  and a  loss related to the write off of a supply agreement no longer being used 
in addition  a  write down was taken due to the company s decision to cease making payments on insurance contracts for an officer of the company 
without these items  selling  general and administrative costs would have decreased by approximately  in the michigan single business tax decreased in primarily because in the company reversed certain credits that it had previously expected to receive 
interest income increased to million in from million in  due to an improved cash position  which resulted from the company s decision to no longer underwrite new leasing business 
interest expense decreased due to the reduction in the outstanding notes payable related to the leasing business 
techteam recognized an income tax credit of million on a pretax loss of million in the consolidated income tax provision is due to the combination of a net income tax credit from us operations  offset in part by an income tax expense from european operations 
the company s effective tax rates for the european operations are not significantly different than the statutory rates 
the company s effective tax rate for the us operations differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to nondeductible goodwill and other intangible asset amortization 
significant accounting estimates at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million  primarily related to alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards in the united states  which do not expire 
realization of the deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
based on historical and expected future taxable income  the company believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
if at any time the company believes that current or future taxable income will not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be provided 
the company periodically reviews its estimate of residual values of leased assets  which consist principally of computer equipment 
the values of the leased assets are impacted by a number of factors including the speed of technological change  the status of used computer equipment market  the attitude of customers regarding renewals and the ability of the company to offer alternatives to its customers 
there can be no assurances that the company s estimates of residual values will accurately reflect the future results 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease resulted primarily from revenue decreases in product support services of million  system integration services of million  and technical staffing of million offset by increases in part in corporate help desk services of million and leasing operations of million 
the decrease in product support services is due in large part to discontinuing business during with several low margin original equipment manufacturers in the computer industry through the ge joint venture 
systems integration revenues decreased due to non recurring revenue related to year remediation services that were provided to a local government in technical staffing revenues decreased due to non recurring revenues related to the implementation of a quality system program for a major client that took place in combined with other various non recurring staffing projects ending with the company s two major customers 
the increase in corporate help desk services was due principally to a major customer expanding its help desk to other business units within its organization and in europe as well as a new help desk project with the european commission that provides information and assistance to european citizens 
leasing revenues increased due to new leases of telecom and computer equipment to existing customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the increase was primarily due to improved margins on existing corporate help desk projects through expansion  while concurrently containing any related incremental costs 
other contributing factors included the discontinuance of certain low margin projects within the ge joint venture as discussed above  along with the completion of non recurring year remediation services provided in to a local government agency 
the remediation services included an equipment replacement component that was provided at lower margins than those normally realized by the company 
gross margins were positively impacted by a net gain from sales of equipment that came off lease of million in and million in there can be no assurance that similar gains will occur in future years 
selling  general and administration expenses increased to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from costs related to the development of the company s call center support portal technology  additional administration overhead costs required at the company s european offices  settlement costs related to a dispute with former employees of the company s leasing operations  and costs to retain investor relations consultants 
the increased administrative costs were required in europe to support revenue increases in at the three european offices belgium  england and germany 
the michigan single business tax increased because the company did not qualify for certain credits that it previously expected

accordingly  the company believes it will take this charge in the first quarter of at december   the leasing operations goodwill is  goodwill amortization related to leasing operations was  in factors affecting future results the risk factors listed in this section  as well as any other cautionary language in this report  provide examples of just a few of the many risks  uncertainties and events that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in the forward looking statements  and could have a significant impact on the company s business financial condition and results of operations 
impact of business with major clients as set forth in item business  techteam depends upon major clients in the us automotive industry for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the loss of any significant customer or a reduction in economic activity in the us automotive industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks inherent in leasing in leasing of computer equipment  it is often difficult to determine  at the time of the lease  the expected value of the equipment after the expiration of the lease 
accordingly  variation in the residual value of equipment leased to clients and the sale price of the equipment can lead to fluctuation in the performance of techteam capital group  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
competition the company faces intense competition for all of its services  including the help desk and call center markets 
some competitors have substantially greater resources  including more locations  greater financial resources  a larger client base  and more name recognition 
as a result  the company has experienced and continues to anticipate significant pricing pressure from its customers in order to remain a preferred vendor 
contract risks the great majority of the company s non leased related contracts are terminable without cause on short notice  often upon days notice 
terminations and non renewals of major contracts could have a material adverse impact upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  increasing portions of the company s projects are billed on a managed service basis where the fee is fixed to perform specified services as opposed to time and materials 
the company s inability to estimate accurately the resources and related expenses required for the managed service project or failure to complete the company s contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the contractual obligations upon which fixed fee contract was based could adversely affect the business 
reliance on senior management the success of the company is highly dependent upon the efforts  direction  and guidance of its senior management 
the company does not have employment agreements with all members of our senior management 
the loss of any of these senior executives or the company s inability to attract  retain  or replace key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
attraction and retention of employees the company s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive 
the company s success depends in large part upon its ability to attract  develop  motivate  and retain highly skilled technical  clerical  and administrative employees 
qualified personnel are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the company expects to experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either increased productivity or higher pricing 
moreover no assurance can be given that techteam will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
interruption of telecommunications services the company s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its technical and customer support centers and its information databases against damages that may be caused by fire and other disasters  power failure  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  computer viruses and other emergencies 
the temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
notwithstanding precautions taken by the company to protect itself and its clients from events that could interrupt delivery of its services  there can be no assurance that a fire  natural disaster  human error  equipment malfunction or inadequacy  or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in the company s ability to provide support services to its clients 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
growth through acquisitions and new products the company s business strategy has included growth through acquisitions of businesses and technology sources complementary to the company s business 
acquisitions involve special risks such as diversion of management s attention  unanticipated events  legal liabilities  and amortization of intangibles  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations certain risks are inherent in the company s business strategy  which includes plans for the global expansion of the company s operations 
the company may encounter difficulties in marketing  selling  and delivering its services outside the united states due  among other things  to differences in cultures  languages  labor and employment policies  and differing political and social systems 
in addition  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected as a result of currency fluctuations and differing tax laws in countries other than the united states 
rapid technological changes  dependence on new solutions the company s success depends in part on its ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in it  evolving industry standards  and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  the company will be successful in the marketplace 
intellectual property rights the company relies upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets  copyright  and trademark laws to protect its proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom the company licenses intellectual property 
the company enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and limits distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that the company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that its services and or software do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that it has all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in its business  the company is subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require the company to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses of the intellectual property that is the subject of asserted infringement 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including  among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common stock  quarterly variations and actual anticipated operating results  growth rates  market conditions in the industry in which the company competes  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions  litigation including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating results and prospects from time to time may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no material market risk sensitive instruments and does not believe its exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments is material 
substantially all of the company s operations are in the united states 
the company s debt obligations have fixed interest rates and relatively short lives 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  inherent in its sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
