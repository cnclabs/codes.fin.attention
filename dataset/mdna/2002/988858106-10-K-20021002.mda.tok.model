this decrease is offset by additional depreciation from the purchase of new assets  principally for new store openings  renovations and refurbishments

table of contents year ended july  compared to year ended july  total revenues 
during fiscal year  the company recorded total revenues of billion  an increase of percent  over total revenues of billion for the prior fiscal year 
sales related to the kiosk operations acquired in september accounted for substantially all of the total revenue increase 
excluding the kiosk operations  sales remained relatively flat over prior year  despite new stores added during the year which was offset by stores closed during the year 
comparable store sales decreased percent in fiscal year on a constant currency basis 
comparable store sales include sales for those stores which were in operation for a full period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year 
management believes the sales reduction in comparable stores was attributable to merchandising decisions early in the year 
in the first half of the year  the company focused more on promotional items at higher markdowns to increase the volume in a period of softening sales  while the spring brought a renewed focus on improving the quality of the inventory 
management believes that sales were negatively affected as a result of the effort to realign inventory  subsequent to the company s change in management 
during the last half of the fiscal year  the company was focusing on the effort to liquidate or realign inventory that did not meet the company s strategic direction 
sales focus has shifted to reemphasize the bridal category

the company recorded a non recurring charge of million in the second quarter to adjust the valuation of certain inventory that was not of a quality consistent with the strategic direction of the company s brands 
the negative impact to margin from the non recurring charge of percent of revenues is offset by the addition of the kiosk operations  which have a higher gross margin rate than the rest of the company s in line stores

the lifo provision was million for the year ended july   compared to a million benefit in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased percent to percent of total revenues for the year ended july  from percent for the year ended july  approximately percent of this increase is principally due to the acquisition of the kiosk operations in september this business has significantly higher store expense as a percentage of revenues than traditional store formats 
excluding the kiosk operations  sg a expenses were percent of revenues  an increase of percentage points over the prior year 
while payroll expenses remained flat as a percentage of revenues  other store expenses such as rent and occupancy and business expenses increased percent of revenues principally as a result of increasing rents for both existing and new stores during a period with lower sales 
advertising costs rose percent of revenues  as increased advertising expenses in fiscal year did not result in a proportionate increase in sales revenue 
these increases were partially offset by the company s ability to leverage its fixed corporate overhead  which decreased percent of revenues 
approximately percentage points of the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of revenues is due to the outsourcing of the company s customer accounts receivables program to a third party 
in the prior year  amounts related to the customer receivables for finance charge income  net of customer receivable account charge offs and credit operating expenses  were included as a net reduction in sg a expense 
subsequent to the outsourcing agreement  only the merchant fees charged by the third party outsourcer to process customer receivables are included as a charge in sg a expense

inflation in management s opinion  changes in net revenues  net earnings  and inventory valuation that have resulted from inflation and changing prices have not been material during the periods presented 
the trends in inflation rates pertaining to merchandise inventories  especially as they relate to gold and diamond costs  are primary components in determining the company s lifo inventory 
there is no assurance that inflation will not materially affect the company in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for example  unexpected changes in market conditions or a downturn in the economy could adversely affect actual results 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other things  inventory obsolescence  goodwill valuation  lifo inventory retail method  legal liability  credit insurance liability  product warranty  depreciation  employee benefits  taxes  and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all us inventories represent finished goods which are valued using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
merchandise inventory of peoples jewellers of canada is valued using the first in  first out fifo retail inventory method 
under the retail method  inventory is segregated into categories of merchandise with similar characteristics at its current retail selling value 
the determination of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying an average cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the cost to retail ratio for each merchandise category is based on beginning inventory and fiscal year purchase activity for each category 
the company is required to determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates 
prior to fiscal year  the company used the bureau of labor statistics bls producer price indices applied against inventory values to calculate the value of inventory on a lifo basis 
in fiscal year  the company applied internally developed indices that the company believes more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of its merchandise ie  diamonds  gold and other metals and precious stones and its merchandise mix 
the company believes the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in its own prices than the bls producer price indices 
the impact on the individual prior years presented and the cumulative effect of this change on earnings at the beginning of fiscal year is not determinable 
at the end of fiscal year  the effect of using internal indices instead of the bls producer price indices was to increase net income by approximately million  or per share 
the company also writes down its inventory for discontinued  slow moving and damaged inventory 
this write down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates  future demand  management strategy  and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or management strategy changes  additional inventory write downs may be required and  in the case of a major change in strategy or downturn in market conditions  such writedowns could be significant 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
such estimates are based on experience and the shrinkage results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least twice annually for all store locations and annually for the distribution centers 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for providing a shrinkage reserve 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated fair values 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cashflow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets based upon updated projections 
any changes in key assumptions or market conditions could result in an unanticipated impairment charge 
for instance  in the event of a major market downturn  individual stores may become unprofitable  which could result in a writedown of the carrying value of the assets located in those stores 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results if a permanent reduction were to occur 
goodwill  which represents the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
the fair value of the company s identified reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of corresponding future cash flows and market values of comparable businesses where available 
the company completed the valuations of its reporting units that include goodwill in fiscal year and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed

reserves are established based on management s best estimates of the company s potential liability in these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and are based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the company operates 
this involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
any resulting deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income 
to the extent that recovery is deemed not likely  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company believes that as of july  the realization of the deferred income tax asset is more likely than not  and thus there was no valuation reserve recorded
