the company s rental businesses are capital intensive  with significant capital expenditures required to maintain and grow the rental assets 
during the last three years  the company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings 
as the following table indicates  cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of rental equipment have been sufficient to fund the rental equipment purchases in the past three years 
funding of rental asset growth year ended december  three year totals amounts in thousands cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the sale of rental equipment total cash available for purchase of rental equipment notes payable increase decrease purchases of rental equipment in addition to increasing its rental assets  the company has invested in other capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in  and has used significant cash to provide returns to its shareholders  both in the form of cash dividends and by stock repurchases 
the company has made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in the over the counter market nasdaq and or through privately negotiated  large block transactions under an authorization of the board of directors 
shares repurchased by the company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock 
as of march    shares remain authorized for repurchase 
the following table summarizes the dividends paid and the repurchases of the company s common stock during the past three years 
dividend and repurchase summary year ended december  three year totals amounts in thousands  except per share data cash dividends paid shares repurchased average price per share aggregate purchase price total cash returned to shareholders as the company s assets have grown  it has been able to negotiate increases in the borrowing limit under its general bank line of credit  which limit is currently million 
the company decreased its borrowings under this line by million during the year  and at december   the outstanding borrowings under this line were million 
in addition to the million line of credit  the company has a million 
table of contents committed line of credit facility related to its cash management services of which million was outstanding as of december  the company had a total liabilities to equity ratio of to and to as of december  and  respectively  and the debt notes payable to equity ratio was to and to at december  and  respectively 
although no assurance can be given  the company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate higher limits on its general bank lines of credit adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and long term debt 
in july  the company completed a private placement of million of senior notes due in interest on the notes is due semi annually in arrears and the principal is due in five equal installments  which commenced on july  the outstanding balance at december   was million 
please see the company s consolidated statements of cash flows on for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the company s cash 
the company does not have any material commitments or obligations requiring the expenditure of cash in the future inconsistent with its expenditures in the periods reported herein 
in june  the company settled a lawsuit  which had been brought against it and seventeen other defendants alleging failure to warn about certain chemicals associated with the building materials used in portable classrooms in california 
as part of the settlement  the company agreed to use alternative building materials 
please see the company s quarterly report on form q filed with the sec on august  for further details of this settlement 
the company believes this will not have a material adverse effect on its costs of operations and does not expect an adverse impact on its liquidity 
the company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through and beyond will be adequately met by operational cash flow  proceeds from sale of rental equipment  and bank borrowings 
sales occur routinely as a normal part of the company s rental business 
however  these sales can fluctuate from year to year depending on customer requirements and funding 
although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from year to year  the company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings and to reduce materially the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment  pay dividends and repurchase its common stock in the future if a need to conserve cash should arise unexpectedly 
critical accounting policies this section contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see general above for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial status depends 
the company determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company has identified its most critical accounting policies are related to rental equipment depreciation  maintenance and repair  and impairment 
descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this management s discussion and analysis 
depreciation the estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the company s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products 
additionally  to the extent information is publicly available  the company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness 
the lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation 
for modular equipment  external factors to consider may include  but are not limited to  changes in legislation  regulations  building codes  local permitting  supply or demand and internal factors may include  but are not limited to  changes in equipment specifications or maintenance policies 
for electronics equipment  external factors to consider may include  but are not limited to  technological advances  changes in manufacturers selling prices  supply or demand and internal factors may include  but are not limited to  changes in equipment specifications or maintenance policies 

table of contents changes in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment 
depending on the magnitude of such changes  the impact on the financial statements could be significant 
in the first quarter of  the company continued to evaluate its rental equipment depreciation and residual value policies 
a decision was made in the first quarter that effective january   the company would prospectively increase its modular rental equipment residual value from to 
additionally  effective january   the estimated useful life of million of optical equipment would be prospectively changed from seven to five years 
maintenance and refurbishment maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
the direct material and labor costs of value added additions or major refurbishment of modular offices are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment 
judgement is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized 
the company s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value added items to specific additions such as restrooms  and foot sidewalls and ventilation up grades 
only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment  which extend its useful life  are capitalized 
changes in these policies could impact the company s financial results 
impairment the carrying value of the company s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation 
to the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value 
the company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its sale considering current market conditions 
additionally  if the company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment  it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose 
due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and the economy  it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations 
market risk this section contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see general above for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the company currently has no material derivative financial instruments that expose the company to significant market risk 
the company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its notes payable 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of the company s notes payable at december  by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
total fair value dollar amounts in thousands fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate impact of inflation although the company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation  from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment  manufacturing costs  operating expenses and interest 
because most of its rentals are relatively short term  the company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices
