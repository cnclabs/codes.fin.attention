critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables on a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meets it financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
investments in unconsolidated companies we monitor our investments in unconsolidated companies for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based on one or more of the following pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information  liquidation values  the values of recent rounds of financing or quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
in order to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  the financial condition of and business outlook for the company  including key operational and cash flow metrics  current market conditions and future trends in the company s industry  and the company s relative competitive position within the industry  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
accounting for income taxes we make estimates related to our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred taxes are determined by calculation of the future tax consequences associated with differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
as a result of this process  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in its consolidated statements of financial condition 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that the company considers it more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established or adjusted in a period  this amount is included in the company s consolidated statements in income as an expense or benefit within the provision for income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portions of our direct investment portfolio 
we place our direct investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing only in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the direct investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
our direct interest bearing investment portfolio includes investments in short term  high credit quality money market funds and us treasury securities 
these investments totaled approximately million at march  with an average interest rate of approximately 
at march   the portfolio also had approximately million of short term  high credit quality municipal debt securities with an average taxable equivalent interest rate of 
the short term money market funds  u 
s treasury securities and the municipal debt securities are not insured and because of the short term nature of the investments are subject to credit risk  but are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
market risk we had million at march  invested in certain market neutral funds managed by our former subsidiary  symphony 
our investments in market neutral programs are non interest bearing and consist principally of long and short positions placed directly through other fund managers in u 
s and non us equity securities of both public and private issuers 
although the intent of the managers of these funds is to structure portfolios that are hedged against general market movements  these investments can be subject to significant changes in market value and are not insured 
all investment decisions with respect to these market neutral programs are made by professional investment advisers and the performance of the funds is reviewed periodically by our management 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk we invoice customers in europe in pounds and euros 
in japan  we bill our customers in yen 
excluding customers in these locations  we generally bill for our services in us dollars 
to the extent we invoice our customers in local currency yen  pound and euro  our international revenues are subject to currency exchange fluctuation risk 
to the extent that international revenues that are invoiced in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
currency fluctuations may also effectively increase the cost of our products and services in countries in which customers are invoiced in us dollars
