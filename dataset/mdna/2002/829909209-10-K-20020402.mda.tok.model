overview we are a semiconductor company that designs  manufactures and markets  high performance  value added analog integrated circuits  primarily for original equipment manufacturers doing business in the high growth markets of networking  computing  and communications 
our four product families  power management  serial interface  analog display and optical storage constitute a broad  synergistic portfolio of standard analog ics that address specific applications in desktop and portable computers  optical storage  handheld digital peripherals such as pdas  cell phones and digital still cameras  and network and telecommunications infrastructure 
we are headquartered in billerica  massachusetts  have manufacturing facilities in massachusetts and california and sales offices in china  japan  korea  taiwan  germany  belgium and the united states and a design research facility in belgium 
we use a combination of in house and outside vendors to fabricate  package and test our ics 
our products are sold directly  or through a global network of independent sales representatives  and a small number of independent distributors 
results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by the respective line items in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative merger related costs restructuring and facility exit costs total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes 
table of contents fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the global slowdown in the semiconductor technology end markets resulting in lower shipment levels 
net sales were also reduced in by reductions in the selling price of some of our power management and interface products 
additionally  net sales were further reduced by the second quarter increase in our reserves for product returns of million  which was based upon our decision to authorize returns from certain distributors in excess of their contractual return privileges  based upon continued slowness in the semiconductor industry 
in the fourth quarter of  sipex accepted distributor orders for certain products on a discounted basis 
revenue from these orders is recognized at the time of shipment  since these orders are non cancelable  non returnable and for which such sales are not subject to the terms of the company s distribution agreement with the distributor  including without limitation the price protection  restocking and other returns rights the distributor is entitled to in the agreement 
year to date net sales were also affected by million in the first quarter of  which is related to a change in the timing of revenue recognition on sales to our largest distributor 
effective october   we began to recognize revenue on sales to our largest distributor when the distributor sells our products to end users sell through  rather than upon shipment of the product to the distributor 
as of december   there was approximately million of inventory shipped to this distributor for which we had recognized revenue prior to october   accordingly  our net sales for the fiscal year ended were impacted by that amount 
our sales were also impacted by million of sales in the fourth quarter to our largest distributor on a discounted  non cancellable and non returnable basis 
approximately of our net sales were derived from international customers in  as compared to in geographically  in  sales decreased in all regions except for europe  as compared to gross margins 
gross profit loss was million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in from was mainly due to the higher operating costs of the hillview fab  lower capacity utilization  wafer fab yield and the lowered selling prices on some of our power management and interface products as a result of the continued global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
in the second quarter of  we announced that a continued softness in our business led to a reduction in the demand on our inventory 
during the several quarters preceding the announcement  we had expanded our internal fabrication facility and test operations in response to forecasts of significant revenue growth in our business 
however  we experienced significant customer deferrals of delivery dates and order cancellations 
due to these customer actions  we were left in a position of higher than normal levels of inventory  which based on current and forecasted demand  would not be consumed during the products life cycle 
as a result  we took an inventory charge of million due to the sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue in our business in addition to additional reserves established as part our inventory valuation process 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the reduction in r d expenses in  as compared to  was mainly due to cost saving measures taken due to the continued slowness in the semiconductor industry 
the reduction included lower bonuses and discretionary spending such as travel  which were offset by continued process development in the new wafer fabrication facility 
the increase as a percentage of net sales in was mainly due to the decreased sales base 
sipex has felt it important to continue to invest in research and development as future product development is critical to achieving the corporate growth plans which are achieved through the development of new products 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the dollar decrease in marketing and selling expenses in over was mainly due to lower commissions due to decreased sales and lower discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment and was partially offset by increased advertising and additional sales resources in asia 
sipex has targeted its growth to include asia  which is a rapidly expanding market for semiconductor products 
the increase as a percent of sales in was mainly due to the lower sales base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the dollar decrease in general and administration expenses was mainly due to controls over spending  and decreased salaries and bonuses in the increase as a percent of sales in was mainly due to the lower sales base 

table of contents restructuring 
during  we recorded charges totaling  for severance payments related to the reduction of our workforce as a result of the continued slowness in the semiconductor market 
as of december   the total costs accrued had been paid 
this charge was offset in the statement of operations by a reduction of  in the restructuring accrual which was established in the fourth quarter of the reduction in was due to the sale of the calogic fabrication facility  which had been planned for closure in early as a result of the sale  we reduced both the facility exit and related equipment disposal costs and employee termination portions of the accrual due to the assumptions of the facility lease and assets by the new owners who retained many of the employees to whom we had planned to pay severance costs 
additionally  the company was able to sublease a facility earlier than expected during which resulted in a reduction of the accrual for facility related costs in the following is a summary of the restructuring activity accrual accrual accrual balance incurred adjustments balance incurred balance to accrual adjustments people related costs facility related costs equipment related disposal costs in the fourth quarter of  management of sipex and the board of directors approved a plan to close certain manufacturing facilities in california  consisting of five locations which were acquired through the merger with calogic and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
total estimated costs of million associated with the closure of the calogic facilities included facility related costs of  costs related to the expected abandonment and disposal of less efficient and duplicate machinery and equipment of  and people related facilities exit and severance costs of  in the third quarter of  sipex realized net proceeds of million from the unanticipated sale of the tangible assets of our semiconductor wafer fab located in milpitas  california which had been written off as part of facility exit costs during this recovery of million has been recorded as a credit to facility exit costs on the statement of operations for resulting in the reporting of net facility exit costs for of approximately  interest and other income  net 
other income expense  net was  and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income was due primarily to interest expense in as a result of borrowings on our bank line of credit  decreased interest income as a result of the decrease in restricted cash in the second quarter of which was used to purchase the land  building and equipment of the milpitas wafer fabrication facility  formerly under the synthetic lease and a  increase in royalty expense due to the discontinuance of royalties paid to sipex under a licensing agreement 
income tax expense 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for compared to an income tax expense of million for  resulting in an effective income tax benefit rate of in compared to an effective tax expense rate of in the effective rate differs from the effective rate primarily due to the disproportionately larger impact of federal and state tax credits on the effective rate in also see income tax discussions below in liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december net sales 
net sales increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was primarily due to greater demand for our products and increased design wins 
the increase in sales was offset by million for a change in the timing of recognizing revenue on sales to our largest distributor and million for additional reserves for distributor returns necessitated by the elimination of certain distributors 
the million is the result of changing the timing of recognizing revenue from when the product is shipped to our largest distributor to when the distributor sells our products through to the oem 
we made this change effective october  when we concluded we could no longer reasonably estimate reserves for returns and price concessions due to a change in our relationship with this certain distributor 
at december   there was approximately million of inventory shipped into this distributor for which revenue was recognized prior to october  that impacted sell through revenue in the first quarter of demand in fiscal year started out strong and declined in the fourth quarter due to a cyclical downturn in the industry 
as a result of the reduced demand  we took order cancellations of approximately million in the fourth quarter of from our distributors 
approximately of our net sales were derived from international customers in compared to in geographically  in  we experienced sales growth of in japan and the pacific rim countries  growth in europe and growth in the us 
table of contents gross margins 
gross profit was million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in from was primarily due to continued high wafer pricing from subcontract manufacturers  lower capacity utilization  additional reserves for distributor returns of million necessitated by the elimination of certain distributors in the fourth quarter  and a million increase in inventory reserves mainly due to an end of life strategy for our legacy product lines assembled products and assp adopted in the fourth quarter of research and development 
research and development r d expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in r d expense in as compared to was due primarily to process development as well as an increase in staffing  particularly design engineering personnel and higher spending for development of mask sets and test wafers 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the dollar increase in marketing and selling expenses in over was due primarily to an increase in staffing  particularly sales personnel in our asian operations and field application engineering 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the dollar increase in general administration expense was due primarily to increased staffing  legal  accounting and other related professional expenses 
restructuring 
in the fourth quarter of  management of sipex and the board of directors approved a plan to close certain office and manufacturing facilities in california consisting of five locations  which were acquired through the merger with calogic and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
total estimated costs of million associated with the closure of the calogic facilities included facility related costs of  costs related to the expected abandonment of less efficient and duplicate machinery and equipment of  and facilities exit and people related severance costs of  all of these costs were accrued as of december  and were estimated to be paid by the end of  except for lease costs which were expected to be paid over a two year period until the closed facilities could be subleased 
see discussion of results of operations above for the table that summarizes the activity in this restructuring 
in accordance with the plan  we closed the calogic manufacturing  sales and administration facilities in pleasanton  california and incurred people related costs and were incurring the lease costs for the closed facility as originally planned  with the exception of one building which was subleased unexpectedly 
however  the slower than anticipated ramp up of our new milpitas wafer fabrication facility during delayed the transition of manufacturing of the calogic products to our new facility and hence delayed the closure of the calogic fremont wafer fabrication facility  which will be closed by the end of the first quarter of the delay in the closure of the fremont facility reduced facility costs by shortening the period in which the leased fabrication facility would be vacant and we also subleased one of our facilities 
consequently  we reduced the facility related portion of the accrual to adjust for the unexpected sublease and the delay in closing this facility 
additionally  the equipment related accrual was adjusted to reflect our revised estimate of costs in abandoning this facility 
as of december    of the restructuring accrual remains which is estimated to be paid by the end of the first quarter of  except for lease termination costs which we expect to incur through the end of the third quarter of 
table of contents interest and other income  net 
other income  net was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in other income was due primarily to lower interest expense due to the payoff of calogic bank obligations in december income tax expense 
we recorded an income tax expense of million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for  resulting in an effective income tax expense rate of in compared to an effective tax benefit rate of in the effective rate differs from the statutory rate due to federal research credits and state tax credits including california manufacturer s investment tax credit 
the effective rates differed from the statutory rate due to the reduction of the valuation allowance for net operating loss carryforwards utilized and deferred tax benefits expected to be realized in the future 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had available funds of million consisting of cash and cash equivalents  as compared to the prior fiscal year balance of million 
working capital decreased to million in  a decrease from the december  balance of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from a million net loss  a million decrease in accounts payable  a million decrease in accrued expenses and a million decrease in other long term liabilities and an million increase in deferred income tax assets 
these cash outflows were partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and a decrease in inventory of million 
the significant decrease in our inventories was primarily due to opportunistic sales in power management and interface products and greater efficiencies in manufacturing 
the decrease in accounts receivable over the prior year was mainly the result of lower shipment levels 
the decrease in accounts payable over the prior year was mainly the result of decreased inventory purchases and capital expenditures  other than the purchase of the land  building and equipment of the milpitas manufacturing facility  which funding was provided through the liquidation of restricted cash 
in  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from an million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories and a million increase in deferred income tax assets and was partially offset by net income of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities for property  plant and equipment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the growth in capital investment related principally to our purchase of the land  building and equipment of our milpitas wafer fabrication facility  which was being leased under a five year operating lease 
in accordance with the provisions of the lease agreement  we paid million  consisting of million for the land  million for the building and million for machinery and equipment 
the recorded cost of the machinery and equipment purchased was reduced by a million long term liability recorded by us through june  as the estimated liability under the lease for the guaranteed residual value of the equipment 
proceeds for the buyout were provided through the liquidation of restricted cash of million that had previously secured the lease of the facility and equipment 
the growth in capital investment related principally to the expansion of our wafer manufacturing facility in milpitas  california and the purchase of machinery and equipment for the facility which was financed substantially through our bank line of credit 
capital investments in related to the expansion of our wafer manufacturing facility in san jose  california  equipment upgrades in all facilities and million relating to upgrading sipex s information systems infrastructure 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on may   we issued  shares of sipex common stock through a private placement of securities  resulting in proceeds to us of million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses 
proceeds from the offering were used to reduce our indebtedness under our bank line of credit and to provide funding for operations 
in addition  in  million was provided by the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options or pursuant to our stock purchase plans 
in  million was provided by the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options or pursuant to our stock purchase plans and million proceeds from long term debt  which was partially offset by the repayment of  of debt obligations 
in   was provided by the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options or pursuant to our stock purchase plans  offset by the repayment of million of debt obligations 

table of contents at december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available to offset future federal taxable income 
in order to fully utilize the deferred tax assets  we will need to generate sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
us loss carryforwards will expire beginning in based on projections of taxable income over the next several years  and considering the limitation imposed by irc section  we believe that none of the loss carryforwards will expire unused 
based upon the level of historical income and projections for future income over the periods which the temporary differences are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
such reduction could have a material adverse effect on our statement of operations resulting from the income tax charge that would be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
in addition to the issuance of common stock  we increased cash flows from operations through a series of salary and spending reductions in the second through fourth quarters of spending reductions included mandatory vacation  salary reductions  reductions in material purchases  controls over discretionary spending and reduced headcount 
sipex has a million borrowing limit with a borrowing base of of our eligible accounts receivable under our bank line of credit 
funds provided through the line of credit are used to provide working capital for sipex s operations 
the loan agreement requires compliance with certain minimum tangible net worth and financial ratios 
during  sipex was in violation of certain of these covenants 
however  waiver of the violations were obtained and the covenants were modified 
at december   sipex was in compliance with the modified covenants and projects to be in compliance in we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  bank loan availability and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in order to grow  we may seek additional funding through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if additional financing is necessary and we are unable to obtain the additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a downturn that is adversely affecting our results of operations 
the continuance of this prolonged downturn may cause continued losses  which in turn could adversely affect our ability to secure additional financing and affect the growth of our business 
the table below summarizes mimimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of december  calendar year thereafter critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  inventories  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies most critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  sales returns  inventory reserves and income taxes and are explained below revenue recognition 
we consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began deferring revenue on ordinary course shipments to our largest distributor until the product is 
table of contents resold by the distributor to the end user sell through because the arrangement with this distributor includes price concession and return rights  the potential impact of which we believed we could no longer reasonably estimate 
for all other product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of shipment because these distributors customers have no price protection and have limited return rights 
in addition  management believes that it is able to estimate and establish appropriate reserves for future returns from these distributors 
for product sales recognized at the time of shipment  sipex accrues for estimated sales returns upon shipment based upon our estimates of future returns 
in the fourth quarter of  sipex accepted distributor orders for certain products on a discounted basis for which the distributor has no rights of return other than for product related issues  price protection or cancellation rights and which are not governed by the terms of the existing distributor contract 
revenue from these orders was recognized at the time of shipment  since these orders are non cancelable  non returnable and for which such sales are not subject to the terms of the company s distribution agreement with the distributor  including without limitation the price protection  restocking and other returns rights the distributor is entitled to in the agreement 
revenue from engineering service contracts is recorded as performance is completed 
sales returns 
we consider the determination of our estimated reserve for sales returns to be a critical accounting policy 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate monthly with our channel partners to gather information about sell through activity  end user satisfaction and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
we use the results of this analysis to estimate the reserves for sales returns 
we adjust our reserves for future returns as is necessary  based on returns experience returns expectations and our communications with our channel partners 
in estimating reserves  we also consider unusual events and market conditions 
for example  as we announced on march   as of the second quarter of  we increased our reserves for returns by million for returns from certain distributors in excess of their contractual return privileges  based upon continued slowness in the semiconductor industry and adjusted our financial statements for the second and third quarters of to reflect the reserve for these returns which had not been provided for at that time 
historically  we have not experienced material differences between our estimated reserves for sales returns and actual results 
however  it is possible that future events such as the introduction of a competitive product  product obsolescence  price competition  continued slowness in the semiconductor industry and distributors desire to decrease levels of inventory in the distribution channel could result in significant changes in customer demand and cause future returns to increase beyond historical levels 
however  management believes that it is able to estimate returns  and establish appropriate reserves for returns from customers for which sipex recognizes revenue as of shipment  using the process described above 
however  since reserves for estimated sales returns are recorded as a reduction in revenues  any significant difference between our estimated and actual returns experience  or changes in our estimate of reserves for future returns  would be reflected in our reported revenues in the period we determine that difference  and could have a material impact on our future results of operations 
inventory reserves 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in the second quarter of  we announced that a continued softness in our business led to a reduction in the demand on our inventory 
during the several quarters preceding the announcement  we had expanded our internal fabrication facility and test operations in response to forecasts of significant revenue growth in our business 
however  we experienced significant customer deferrals of delivery dates and order cancellations 
due to these customer actions  we were left in a position of higher than normal levels of inventory  which based on current and forecasted demand  would not be consumed during the products life cycle 
as a result  we took an inventory charge of million due to the sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue in our business 
income taxes 
we assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets of million as of december   by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible 
we considered the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
at december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which were available to offset future federal taxable income 
these losses expire beginning in through we also had massachusetts and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which are scheduled to expire beginning in to in addition  we had federal and state tax credits of approximately million and million  which are scheduled to expire from to  respectively 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax assets  the company will need to generate the following amounts of aggregate future taxable income within the periods noted below in order that none of the loss or credit carryforwards expire unused 
approximate cumulative type of deductible years expiration taxable income temporary difference generated dates required us loss carryforwards million us loss carryforwards million massachusetts loss carryforwards million california loss carryforwards million us tax credit carryforwards million california tax credit carryforwards million based on projections of taxable income over the next several years  and considering the limitation imposed by irc section  we believe that none of the loss carryforwards will expire unused 
based upon our projections for future income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
such reduction could have a material adverse affect on our statement of operations resulting from the income tax charge that would be required to reflect a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider and rely upon projections of future taxable income 
the key assumptions in our projections include sales growth rates  production volumes and yields and expected levels of operating expenditures in addition to the factors discussed below in the section titled factors affecting future operating results 
these assumptions are subject to variation based upon both internal factors and external factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
to the extent that actual experience deviates from our assumptions  our projections would be affected and hence our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may change 
such a change will likely occur if the current downturn in our industry is prolonged 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations fas and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  fas also specifies the criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
fas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment  at least annually  in accordance with the provisions of fas fas will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the provisions of fas were effective immediately  except with regard to business combinations initiated prior to july  fas will be effective as of january  goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a business combination completed after july  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with appropriate pre fas accounting literature 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of fas on july   we adopted fas we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
fasb recently issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
sfas also requires the enterprise to record the contra to the initial obligation as an increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and to depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently examining the impact of this pronouncement on our results of operations and financial position  but currently believe the impact will not be material 
on october   fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principle board opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions abp  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently examining the impact of this pronouncement on our results of operations and financial position  but currently believe the impact will not be material 

table of contents factors affecting future operating results fluctuations in operating results our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales and profitability from period to period  including overall economic conditions in the united states  particularly as a result of the events of september th  and abroad  competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  availability of foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  market acceptance of our and our customers products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  our ability to manufacture in the correct mix to respond to orders on hand and new orders received in the future  the timing of investments in research and development  including tooling expenses associated with product development  process improvements and production  the level of future product returns  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
due to the absence of substantial noncancelable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues and are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
our future revenues are difficult to predict and at times in the past we have failed to achieve revenue expectations 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason  operating results are likely to be harmed 
based on forecasts  we may increase our operating expenses for personnel and new product development and for inventory in anticipation of increasing sales levels  therefore  operating results would be harmed if increased sales are not achieved 
in addition  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a downturn that is adversely affecting our results of operations 
our net revenue for the quarters ended september  and december  decreased and from the same periods in our business depends on market demand for products using analog semiconductors 
prolonged downturns in the semiconductor industry will lead to downturns in our net income and may cause continued losses and cash flow shortages 
capital requirements in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in our facilities and capital equipment 
we have funded a portion of our capital investments through long term debt under our million line of credit with a commercial bank 
in addition to this line of credit  we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time and cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
moreover  any future equity or convertible debt financing will decrease the percentage of equity ownership of existing stockholders and may result in dilution  depending on the price at which the equity is sold or the debt is converted 
supply and manufacturing risks our manufacturing processes are highly complex and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
process changes can result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields that could result in product introduction or delivery delays 
in addition  yields can be adversely affected by minute impurities in the environment or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and are time consuming or expensive to remedy 
from time to time we have experienced yield variances 
in particular  new process technologies or new products can be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
we cannot be assured that our foundry or those of our suppliers will not experience yield variances or other manufacturing problems that result in delayed product introduction or delivery delays 
we currently rely on a variety of outside foundries to supply fully processed semiconductor wafers 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of assured wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields  capacity and production costs 
the occurrences of any supply or other problems such as the wafer shortages could have a negative impact on our business revenues and results of operations 

table of contents from time to time  the overall semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth which has created industry wide capacity shortages and extended lead times for contract assembly  raw wafers  capital equipment  foundry wafers and various other products and services that are critical to our performance 
we are seeking to establish and maintain critical inventories and alternate sources to minimize the impact of our vendors capacity limitations 
however  there may be future shortages of key services that harm our business and results of operations 
in an effort to reduce our reliance on outside fabricators for our wafers  we have built an in house fabrication facility in milpitas  california 
we have brought wafer production in house and have transitioned substantially all of our products to the new fab 
the new facility is a sophisticated  highly complex  state of the art factory 
actual production rates depend upon the continued reliable operation and effective integration of a variety of hardware and software components 
we cannot be sure that all of these components will be fully functional or successfully integrated or that the facility will achieve the forecasted yield targets 
we have experienced and may continue to experience unexpected delays and problems in qualifying and ramping up production at this new facility 
our failure to implement the new fab successfully and in a timely fashion may impact future revenue growth and operating results 
in addition  the amount of capital expenditures required to bring the facility to full operating capacity could be greater than currently anticipated 
higher costs to bring the facility to full operating capacity will reduce margins and could harm our business and results of operations 
environmental regulations we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject us to significant future liabilities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we have not in the past violated laws or regulations  which violations could result in remediation or other significant liabilities  or that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will not result in remediation or other significant liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations 
intellectual property rights the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
although we are not aware of any pending or threatened patent litigation which we consider material  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us with respect to existing or future products or technologies and we have been subject to such claims in the past 
in litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we may be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  with respect to disputed third party technology 
in the event of a successful claim against us and our failure to develop or license a substitute technology at a reasonable cost  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on new or enhanced products our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate changes  to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advancements and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our products may be rendered obsolete if we fail to anticipate or react to change  and  as a result  revenues and cash flow may be negatively impacted 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new semiconductor devices for existing and new markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into new products of customers 
the development of these new devices is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields and market acceptance of our and our customers products 

table of contents our success also depends upon the ability to accurately specify and certify the conformance of our products to applicable standards and to develop our products in accordance with our customers requirements 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products will achieve market acceptance 
competition the semiconductor industry we compete in markets that are intensely competitive  and which exhibit both rapid technological changes and continued price erosion 
our competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater financial  technical and management resources than us 
loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would affect our operating results and financial condition 
to remain competitive  we continue to evaluate our manufacturing operations  looking for additional cost savings and technological improvements 
if we are not able to successfully implement new process technologies and to achieve volume production of new products at acceptable yields  our operating results and financial condition may be affected 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to accurately identify emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others increase device performance and improve manufacturing yields  adapt products and processes to technological changes  and adopt and or set emerging industry standards 
we cannot assure you that our design  development and introduction schedules for new products or enhancements to our existing and future products will be met 
in addition  we cannot assure you that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance  or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us 
international sales we derive a significant portion of our net sales from international sales  including asia  which are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
international sales in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  representing  and of total net sales  respectively 
there can be no assurance that economic troubles in any geographic portion of the world will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
stock price volatility the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
in the quarter ended december   our stock price ranged from a high of to a low of 
in the first quarter of ending march   our stock price ranged from a high of to a low of 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on january   our closing stock price was  down from closing price on january  as a result of a press release announcing lower than expected revenue and earnings 

table of contents key employees our success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  such as experienced analog circuit designers 
the competition for these employees is intense 
most of our employees are employees at will and we have no fixed term employment agreements with most employees  which means that they can terminate their employment at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our design engineers  executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our design engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for these personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could seriously impede our success 
sales and distribution channels an integral part of our strategy is to expand our sales and distribution channels 
we are increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding these channels but we may not be successful doing so 
if we are successful in increasing our sales through indirect sales channels  we expect that those sales will be at lower per unit prices than sales through direct channels  and revenues we receive for each sale will be less than if we had sold the same product to the customer directly 
selling through indirect channels may also limit our contact with our customers 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
even if we successfully expand our distribution channels  any new distributors may not have the technical expertise required to market and support our products successfully 
if parties do not provide adequate levels of services and technical support  our customers could become dissatisfied  we could be required to devote additional resources for customer support  and our brand name and reputation could be harmed 
our strategy of marketing products directly to our customers and indirectly through distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and  to the extent different distributors target the same customers  distributors may also come into conflict with each other 
although we have attempted to manage our distribution channels to avoid potential conflicts  channel conflicts may harm our relationships with existing sales representatives or distributors or impair our ability to attract sales representatives 
dependence on distributors approximately of our net sales are from shipments of our product to distributors who sell directly to oems 
our agreements with distributors contain provisions for return of our product including stock rotations whereby distributors may return a percentage of their product based upon a percentage of their most recent six months shipments and in certain circumstances upon termination of the distributor relationship 
we estimate the amount of future returns and have established reserves for estimated returns based upon information including sales during the period into the distribution channel  reported sell through by distributors to oems  distributor inventory levels and the specific terms of the distributor agreements as well as historical returns experience 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began deferring revenue on shipments to our largest distributor until the product is resold by the distributor to the end user sell through because the arrangement with this distributor included price concessions and return rights the potential impact of which we believed we could no longer reasonably estimate legal risks as is outlined in part i  item  we have been named in two  virtually identical purported securities class action lawsuits 
the complaints allege  among other things  incorrect statements in our financial statements for the second and third quarters of fiscal year and seek an unspecified award of damages 
we believe that the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  however  and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this pending litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
our financial instruments are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 

table of contents investment rate risk 
our financial instruments are primarily money market funds 
we do not believe these money market funds have a material exposure to interest rate risk
