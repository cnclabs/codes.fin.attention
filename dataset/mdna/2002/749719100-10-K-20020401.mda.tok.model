item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
for purposes of these acts  any statement that is not a statement of historical fact may be a forward looking statement 
for example  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions may be forward looking statements 
however  we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements in this report because these statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including without limitation the factors set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
all references to common stock and per share amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the three for two common stock split effected as a dividend on our common stock in march we are a leading provider of electronic security e security solutions 
our products are designed to help organizations ensure the authenticity of the people  devices and transactions involved in electronic business e business 
we believe that through our four product lines we directly address the most critical e security requirements for e business 
we sell our two factor user authentication  web access management  encryption and digital certificate management products and solutions to corporate enterprise users seeking turnkey security solutions  and to original equipment manufacturers and developers developers seeking software development components for embedding security in a range of software applications or hardware devices 
in september  we acquired securant technologies  inc securant  a privately held company that developed the award winning cleartrust web access management solution 
the web access management solution is designed to expand the number and types of users who can access networks  applications and web sites  and at the same time  is designed to consolidate numerous web sites under a comprehensive portal management system 
as a result of the securant acquisition  we established the rsa cleartrust web access management solution as our fourth product line 
we conduct our business in two segments e security solutions and rsa capital 
through our e security solutions segment  we derive our operating revenue primarily from two distinct product groups enterprise solutions  which includes rsa securid authenticators  rsa ace server software  rsa cleartrust software  rsa keon software  and maintenance and professional services  and developer solutions  which includes rsa bsafe cryptographic software and protocol products  rsa keon components  and maintenance and professional services 
typically  our enterprise solutions customers place an initial order for a limited number of users  for either our rsa securid authenticators or any of our software products 
as the use of our products grows within the enterprise our customers place additional orders with us to add more users 
as authenticators expire  typically three to four years after initial purchase  additional replacement authenticators are ordered 
in most cases the customer will also enter into a customer support agreement with us at the time of initial purchase and renew this support agreement annually 
we typically base our rsa ace server  rsa keon and rsa cleartrust software license fees on the number of users authorized under each customer s license 
with respect to developer solutions  rsa bsafe software licensing terms vary by product and customer 
typical licensing terms may include an initial prepaid license fee and ongoing royalties paid as a percentage of the developer s product or service revenue  or payment of annual license fees  or a single fully paid up license fee 
often  our existing developer customers go on to license new software or technology from us or wish to increase the field of use rights for the technology they have already licensed 
in such a case  we amend our license agreement with the customer and charge additional licensing fees  thus deriving additional revenue 

table of contents our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars and local currency with the majority of our sales denominated in us dollars 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
for countries outside the united states  we generally pay our operating expenses in local currency 
where we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets 
we have contracted with outside manufacturing organizations to produce our rsa securid authenticators  and some of our products contain technology that is licensed from third parties 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture and delivery of rsa securid authenticators and royalty fees that we pay for the licensed technology 
cost of revenue also includes professional service  customer support  and production costs 
production costs include the programming labor  shipping  inspection and quality control functions associated with the rsa securid authenticators 
in january  we formed our rsa capital segment to make synergistic investments in both external and internal activities and technologies 
we formed the rsa capital segment during a period in which we perceived a favorable investment climate 
with the general weakening of the global economy during we believe the investment climate has changed  and therefore we plan to eliminate the rsa capital segment during our rsa capital segment consists of our investment activities and our new emerging security technologies group  or nest 
through our investment activities  we have historically made investments primarily in equity instruments of e businesses and other technology companies 
at december  we held investments in private companies which we account for under the cost method 
when we hold investments in public companies  we account for them as available for sale marketable securities  provided our ownership does not exceed 
also included in our investment activities is rsa ventures  our venture capital fund  in which we had invested million as of december  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the amount of our subscription to invest in rsa ventures from million to million  leaving a remainder of million that we may invest  at our sole discretion  over the ten year life of rsa ventures 
we currently do not intend to use this amount for new investments  but only for follow on investments in companies in which rsa ventures has already invested 
expenses incurred in connection with our investment activities are primarily for general and administration and management and professional fees 
some of our employees and directors have also invested in the general partner of rsa ventures  including charles r 
stuckey  jr 
and james k 
sims  members of our board of directors  and five former employees including the managing director of rsa ventures 
mr 
stuckey invested approximately thousand in the general partner  mr 
sims invested approximately thousand and the five employees invested a total of approximately thousand 
none of the investors received any proceeds or profits from this entity during in december  in connection with the reduction of the investing activities of rsa ventures  the interest in gains from the general partner that each of messrs stuckey and sims would be entitled to receive in the future following a return of their invested capital was reduced to less than one one thousandth of a percent 
in addition and as part of our rsa capital segment  we also hold an interest in crosby finance  llc crosby  a qualified special purpose entity 
crosby was established specifically to own the shares of verisign common stock  three forward contracts forwards and one variable delivery forward vdf contract  which we contributed to crosby on november  we have the right to appoint the members of the board of directors of crosby  one of whom is required to be an independent director who is not an employee  director or stockholder of rsa security or otherwise affiliated with us and who does not receive any direct or indirect benefit from us 
the other members of the crosby board of directors are two of our officers 
none of the crosby directors has any ownership or interest in crosby or its profits or assets  and with the exception of the independent director  none of the directors are compensated for serving as a director of 
table of contents crosby

revenue earned and expenses incurred in connection with nest include general and administration expenses  as well as the operations of g international  inc gi and transindigo inc transindigo 
over the first three quarters of and as part of the elimination of the rsa capital segment  we intend to merge the nest operations into our e security solutions segment 
additional information on our industry segments may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructurings  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  the actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources sales of products  including hardware and software licenses  and services  including maintenance  support and professional services 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period 
material differences may affect the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates in establishing our allowance for sales returns 
revenue from sale of products is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  as amended and interpreted 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenue is reduced by provisions for estimated sales returns based on various factors including historical experience  and data analyzed by product line and customer s industries 

table of contents for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when payment becomes due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we do not record revenue until such time when collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
in our arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance clauses  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
beginning january  and as discussed below  for sales to distributors who have only limited return rights  revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment  and a sales return reserve is recorded to provide for estimated product returns 
our stocking distributor program began in all of our products are sold to stocking distributors  with authentication products comprising most sales 
our stocking distributors purchase our products  take title upon shipment and resell the products to their customers 
stocking distributors have contractual rights of return for stock rotation purposes of generally to of their purchase volume 
prior to january  we believed we lacked sufficient data to reasonably estimate returns from stocking distributors and therefore we recognized revenue upon evidence of a sale to the end user 
by the beginning of  we had sufficient data to reasonably estimate stocking distributor returns and we determined that historically  actual return volumes have averaged less than of stocking distributor purchase volume 
based on this experience and the criteria set out in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we began recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to the stocking distributors  net of estimated returns 
our revenue recognized from sales to stocking distributors in increased by million due to this change in estimate 
the increase in recognized revenue of million resulted in a decrease to net loss of million and a decrease to diluted loss per share of for the year ended december  stocking distributor purchases in were million and stocking distributor sales to their customers were million 
when arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
our determination of fair value of each of the undelivered elements in multi element arrangements is based on vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for each element is either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
for arrangements containing multiple elements wherein vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until vsoe of fair value exists or all elements have been delivered 
maintenance service revenue  whether sold separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally twelve months 
revenue allocated to professional service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for sales returns we record allowances for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related revenue in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  current economic trends  product line and customer industry and other known factors 
our historical experience with sales returns varies by product line depending on the customer s industries and markets 
sales returns of all products have historically been lower 
table of contents in established markets and higher in newer technology and geographic markets 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the allowances for estimated sales returns in any reporting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any reporting period if actual sales returns and allowances exceed our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which have been included in our statements of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined generally based on discounted cash flows 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets which accounted for approximately of our total assets 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we are required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment issues during the first six months of  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
during the year ended december  we did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
long term investments our long term investments include investments in preferred and common stock of privately held companies and our interest in crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity 
at december  we had approximately million of long term investments which included million for investments in preferred and common stock of privately held companies and million for our interest in crosby 
the fair value of our long term investments depends on the performance of the companies in which we have invested  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the companies in which we have invested 
if these forecasts are not met we may have to record additional impairment charges that we have not previously recognized 
the recoverability of long lived assets is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets to the carrying value of the assets 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets  we must recognize an impairment charge 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of impairment losses related to our long term investments 
we account for our investment in crosby under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
we are carrying our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities 
fair value is being determined based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds under the vdf 
our remaining investment in crosby has a fair value of million at december   
table of contents and is recorded in investments as a long term assets 
should our investment in crosby become worthless  we would incur a pretax charge of million  which would be included in the statement of operations 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the statutory tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary difference are expected to reverse 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset may increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset may be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
during and in connection with our acquisition of dynasoft in  we recorded a million valuation allowance  reducing a deferred tax asset to an amount that management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
during we reversed this valuation allowance due to revised estimates of what management believes will more likely than not be realized 
during we recorded a million valuation allowance  primarily related to acquisition related net operating loss carryforwards  reducing a deferred tax asset to an amount that management believes will more likely than not be realized 
tax benefits relating to the acquisition related net operating loss carryforwards valuation allowance realized in the future will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets which arose from the acquisitions completed during restructurings during and we commenced consolidation of certain operations in order to enhance operational efficiency  and recorded significant restructuring charges in connection with these consolidations 
restructuring charges were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during we reversed million of restructuring charges recorded during due to revised estimates of facility exit costs 
facility exit costs included in these restructuring charges represent up to eighteen months of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to minimum lease payments due under certain excess facilities lease agreements  impaired leasehold improvements  and other associated facilities expense 
estimates related to sublease income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable subleasees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analysis 
if the assumptions for these estimates change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these facilities could vary by material amounts

in september we acquired securant technologies  inc a privately held company that developed and delivered the cleartrust web access management solutions 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the securant acquisition  we established the rsa cleartrust web access management solution as our fourth product line  which generated revenue of million for our stocking distributor program began in all of our products are sold to stocking distributors  with authentication products comprising most sales 
our stocking distributors purchase our products  take title upon shipment and resell the products to their customers 
stocking distributors have contractual rights of return for stock rotation purposes of generally to of their purchase volume 
prior to january  
table of contents we believed we lacked sufficient data to reasonably estimate returns from stocking distributors and therefore we recognized revenue upon evidence of a sale to the end user 
by the beginning of  we had sufficient data to reasonably estimate stocking distributor returns and we determined that historically  actual return volumes have averaged less than of stocking distributor purchase volume 
based on this experience and the criteria set out in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we began recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to the stocking distributors  net of estimated returns 
our revenue recognized from sales to stocking distributors in increased by million due to this change in estimate 
the increase in recognized revenue of million resulted in a decrease to net loss of million and a decrease to diluted loss per share of for the year ended december  stocking distributor purchases in were million  and stocking distributor sales to their customers were million 
we believe that our revenue grew at a slower rate in than it has done historically  not because of competitive pressures  but instead due to the general weakening of the global economy 
we believe impacts of the general weakening of the global economy and the hesitant economic climate after the september th terrorist attacks include decreases in spending by corporate information technology departments and decreases in spending by software developers 
we also believe developer spending decreased substantially with the fall off in venture investing after the collapse of many dot 
com companies 
we believe the increase in service revenue can primarily be attributed to increased maintenance revenue due to an increase in the number of installed users over the past several years 
we believe that the slight increase in revenue for over  despite the current economic climate  is an indication of the continuing and renewed importance of e security solutions to the online economy and is also in part due to our product line synergies which enable us to sell additional products to existing customers 
we believe total revenue will increase in as compared to  however we expect the rate of increase to be significantly lower than rates of increase achieved in the previous three years 
the number of rsa securid authenticator units sold increased in to million from million in the average selling price per authenticator unit decreased in to from in the increase in number of units sold combined with the decrease in the average selling price per unit contributed to the increase in rsa securid authentication product line revenue of in to million from million in we believe that the revenue generated from our authenticator product line continues to provide steady overall growth for us  and our rsa keon product line has shown growth in emerging pki markets  despite the weakened global economy 
we believe that the decrease in developer revenue can be attributed to the weakened global economy  a decrease in new software development companies and the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line 
we expect developer revenue in to decrease significantly as compared to developer revenue in our strong revenue growth in international markets combined with a decrease in americas revenue contributed to the increase in international revenue as percentage of total revenue for we believe that a portion of our increase in international revenue is due to our growing penetration of international markets  and we believe that international revenue will continue to increase as the demand for our products continues to mature internationally 
gross profit our total gross profit decreased in to million from million in total gross profit was for versus for the gross profit from sales of products was  or million for versus  or million for the decrease in total gross profit and gross profit from sales of products for as compared to can be primarily attributed to lower than anticipated revenue due to the general weakening of the global economy  combined with the write off of prepaid license fees of million during the first quarter of these prepaid license fees were expensed to cost of product revenue when it was determined that they have no future value to us as a result of our acquisition of xcert international  inc xcert in february the total gross profit on maintenance and professional services was  or million for versus  or million for the increase

these increases was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in payroll  overhead and consulting expenses 
we expect general 
table of contents and administrative expenses to decrease in as compared to due to the elimination of the rsa capital segment during acquisitions during  we completed four acquisitions  which were accounted for as purchases 
the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the consolidated statement of operations for from their respective dates of acquisition 
costs related to these acquisitions are for investment banking  professional fees and other direct costs  including employee severance and facilities closure  and were recorded on the dates of acquisition and have been included in the allocation of the purchase prices 
in september we acquired all of the capital stock of securant  a privately held company that developed the cleartrust web access management solution  for an aggregate of million in cash including acquisition costs 
in may we acquired all of the capital stock of gi  a privately held company that developed smart card and biometric authentication products  and substantially all of the assets of transindigo  a privately held company that developed real time web access management software products  for an aggregate of million in cash including acquisition costs 
in february we acquired all of the capital stock of xcert  a privately held company that developed digital certificate based products for securing e business transactions  for million in cash  including acquisition costs  plus the assumption of all xcert stock options 
the purchase prices and costs of the securant  gi  transindigo and xcert acquisitions were as follows gi and securant xcert transindigo total in millions cash paid to sellers or shareholders stock options assumed acquisition costs total purchase price allocation of the purchase prices for all four acquisitions completed during were based on estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on preliminary independent appraisals 
the allocations of purchase prices are subject to revision based on the final determination of appraised and other fair values

table of contents goodwill acquired in acquisitions completed before june  was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill acquired in acquisitions completed after june  is not amortized  but rather will be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
in connection with these acquisitions  we incurred certain operating expenses which are included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  these operating expense items include the write off of prepaid license fees of million  which is included in cost of product revenue  and stock option compensation expense of million  which is included in cost of service revenue  research and development  marketing and selling and general and administrative expenses  in process research and development ipr d of million  and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets of million 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we discontinued amortizing goodwill from acquisitions completed before june  and will not record any amortization expense on goodwill after january  goodwill amortization expense was approximately million for the year ended december  we will continue to amortize other intangible assets with finite lives 
at december   goodwill from acquisitions completed before june  was approximately million  net of accumulated amortization and other intangible assets of approximately million  net of accumulated amortization 
we have reclassified approximately million of intangible assets with indefinite lives relating to in place workforce to goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
on january  we expect to record amortization expense on other intangible assets of approximately million during the year ending december  we do not anticipate taking an impairment charge on the remaining goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
we used an independent appraiser to calculate the amounts allocated to assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets and ipr d 
the independent appraiser used established valuation techniques accepted in the high technology industry  including the income method  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value  and the cost method  which uses replacement costs 
these methods give consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  product sales cycles  and the estimated lives of each of the product s underlying technology 
for ipr d  consideration was also given to the projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development and the projected cost to complete the project 
the acquired ipr d consists of development projects through the respective dates of acquisition on the projects described below 
ipr d expense of million in represents the write off of ipr d of million  million  million and million in connection with the acquisitions of securant  xcert  gi and transindigo  respectively 
the amounts allocated to ipr d projects were expensed in the quarter that the related acquisition was consummated because technological feasibility of the ipr d projects had not been achieved and there were no alternative future uses 
estimated costs to complete associated with the ipr d projects are for payroll and related overhead costs for engineers employed in the completion of these development projects 
we would revise the estimate of remaining costs to be incurred should the projects fail to meet technological feasibility 
the valuation of the ipr d was determined using the income method 
revenue and expense projections as well as technology assumptions were prepared for to years based on information provided by the acquired companies management 
revenue projections for each ipr d project were identified as revenue derived from products relying on current technology  if any  and revenue derived from projects relying on a new ipr d project 
expense projections including cost of products sold and operating expenses varied depending on the ipr d project 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle  and resulting in discount rates in a range of  depending on the ipr d project 
the fair value of ipr d was determined separately from all other acquired assets using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion ratios were estimated based on the estimated

at september   we owned million shares of verisign common stock  which were classified as available for sale 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we entered into costless collars covering all of our shares of verisign common stock 
the collars protected us against declines in the market value of verisign by ensuring that at least a portion of our unrealized gain was hedged and realizable 
between october  and 
table of contents september  we settled four collar contracts by delivering million shares of verisign common stock and realized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
on november  we exercised our right to terminate the collars on the remaining million shares of verisign common stock 
we delivered shares of verisign common stock to terminate the collars  which resulted in no cash proceeds to us and the recognition of a net gain of million during after termination of the collars  we had million shares of verisign common stock remaining 
in order to create current liquidity  on november  we entered into three forwards with respect to million shares of verisign common stock and a vdf contract with respect to million shares of verisign common stock 
each forward contract required us to deliver approximately million shares at specific dates during the first three quarters of upon each delivery of shares  we were entitled to receive million  for total proceeds of million in the first three quarters of under the vdf contract  we received cash proceeds of million and committed to deliver million shares of verisign common stock in january in addition  the vdf contract entitles us to additional cash proceeds of up to million depending on the market price of verisign common stock on january   as follows market price of verisign common stock proceeds to to to million over million no gain was recognized upon execution of either the forwards or the vdf 
however  immediately following the execution of the forwards and the vdf  we contributed the remaining million shares of verisign common stock and transferred our rights and obligations in the forwards and the vdf to crosby and received a interest in crosby 
crosby is a bankruptcy remote qualified special purpose entity  established specifically to securitize the shares of verisign common stock 
the contribution and the transfer have been accounted for as a sale under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  we recognized a net gain of million and do not consolidate crosby for accounting purposes 
the counterparty to the vdf contract holds the remaining interest in crosby 
we have the right to appoint the members of the board of directors of crosby  one of whom is required to be an independent director who is not an employee  director or stockholder of rsa security or otherwise affiliated with us and who does not receive any direct or indirect benefit from us 
the other members of the crosby board of directors are two of our officers 
none of the crosby directors has any ownership or interest in crosby or its profits or assets  and with the exception of the independent director  none of the directors are compensated for serving as a director of crosby 
the crosby board of directors manages the operations of crosby  but neither the crosby board nor either of the members of crosby has the power to cause crosby to engage in any business other than holding shares of verisign common stock  the forwards and the vdf and performing its obligations under the forwards and the vdf contracts 
during  the three forwards matured and crosby received total cash proceeds of million upon delivery of million shares of verisign common stock to the counterparty 
crosby distributed the proceeds from the forwards to us and the counterparty at our respective membership interest percentages 
this generated cash proceeds of million and resulted in a gain of million to us  which is included in income from investing activities for at december  crosby holds million shares of verisign and the vdf contract 
crosby has no liability or obligation to its members or counterparty to the vdf contract other than to deliver the shares of verisign common stock to the counterparty upon maturity of the vdf contract and to distribute the cash proceeds  if any  to its members 
after settlement of the vdf in january  crosby will dissolve 

table of contents our interest in crosby was million and million and the unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax was and million at december  and  respectively 
we account for our investment in crosby under the guidelines of eitf  recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
prior to the settlement of the forwards  the retrospective interest method was used to account for our interest in crosby as we believed it would recover a substantial amount of its interest 
any increases in the cost basis of our interest in crosby  determined by applying the retrospective interest method  were recorded in interest income 
any changes in the fair value of our interest in crosby were recorded in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
upon the distribution of the cash proceeds of the forwards by crosby  a portion of the previously unrealized gain which approximated million  was recognized in income from investing activities for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  subsequent to the settlement of the last forward  it became reasonably possible that we could lose all or substantially all of the value of its remaining interest  and therefore could no longer apply the retrospective interest method to our interest in crosby 
accordingly  we are carrying our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities 
fair value of our interest in crosby is being determined based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds upon maturity of the vdf 
unless the verisign stock appreciates substantially in value by january  we will not be entitled to any cash flows from our remaining interest in crosby 
we believe our interest in crosby has declined to a fair value of approximately million at march   and accordingly will record an approximate million charge to earnings for the three months ended march  the gain recorded for financial reporting purposes upon execution of the vdf contract and its contribution to crosby in has not been recognized for tax purposes  and accordingly  we have recorded a million deferred tax liability 
this deferred tax liability will reverse upon maturity of the vdf contract in  and the gain will be included in the calculation of our taxable income for the recognition of that gain would result in a tax liability to us and may require the payment of cash to settle the tax liability 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to million during  from million during  primarily due to lower pre tax income for the year ended december  while we incurred a loss of million for the year ended december  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  due to the non deductibility of certain expenses we had taxable income for our effective tax rate increased primarily due to acquisition related goodwill amortization expenses and in process research and development charges that are non deductible for tax purposes

our effective tax rate decreased to in from in primarily due to the effect of state taxes on investment income 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   consisting primarily of operating cash and short term investments 
this represents a decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  the major uses of cash during include cash used by operations of million  cash used by investing activities of million and cash used by financing activities of million 
cash used by investing activities of million during consisted primarily of million of cash used in the acquisitions of securant  xcert  gi and transindigo  million of cash used to purchase equity investments  and million of cash used to purchase property and equipment  including leasehold improvements for our new leased headquarters facility in bedford  massachusetts

these uses of cash in financing activities were partially offset by cash provided  net of financing costs  by the issuance of convertible debentures of million and proceeds of employee exercises and purchases under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million 
during october and november we issued convertible subordinated debentures with an aggregate principal amount of million  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
interest is payable in cash semi annually at a fixed rate of per annum  and we expect to pay million of interest expense during the year ending december  the debentures mature on october   unless redeemed earlier by us or converted into shares of our common stock at the holder s option 
at any time and at their option  each holder may convert any outstanding debentures into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the holders of the warrants issued with the debentures may exercise the warrants at any time until october  at an exercise price of 
the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances  such as events that would cause dilution of the debenture holders interest 
we can redeem all or a portion of the convertible debentures for cash at any time on or after october   as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day during the fifteen trading day period immediately prior to the election to redeem is of the conversion price 
the debentures are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness

the covenants limit the amount of debt we may incur to the lesser of of our consolidated stockholders equity or a total of million including the balance of the convertible debentures outstanding 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and accounts receivable days outstanding calculated as net accounts receivable divided by revenue per day will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and accounts receivable days outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as amount of international sales and length of customer s payment cycle 
we also record 
table of contents deferred maintenance billings as accounts receivable  and the timing of these billings affects the accounts receivable days outstanding 
historically international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our accounts receivable days outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
due to the current economic climate we may observe an increase in the length of our customer s payment cycle 
typically  enterprise customers are granted payment terms of days 
however  customers have begun to require longer payments terms than typical  for example  developer customers are requiring payment terms of days when past sales were typically due upon licensing 
to address increases in accounts receivable balance and to improve cash flow  we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables 
discounts offered to customers to encourage payment are deducted from revenue 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and increased estimates for reserves against revenue and will be subject to greater general credit risks

our plans for future uses of cash may include additional acquisitions of other entities or technologies  retirement of debt outstanding and additional purchases of property and equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures in will be primarily for purchases of property and equipment and will aggregate up to approximately million 
although we have adequate liquidity to meet our existing and future obligations  we are currently evaluating our financing alternatives to enhance our liquidity 
we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  because of our concern that the current economic conditions may persist for some or all of  if not longer  we have taken steps to reduce our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenues  including a reduction in our workforce  a reduction in discretionary program spending  a temporary reduction in our employees salaries and the elimination of activities that are not core to our operating business  such as the activities of our rsa capital segment 
we anticipate that current cash on hand  cash from sales of marketable securities  cash generated from operations  and cash generated from the exercise of employee options and employee stock purchase plans will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for at least the next twelve months

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results our operating results tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including  among others the size  timing and shipment of individual orders for our products  customers deferring their orders in anticipation of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in our operating expenses  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of our products and our competitors products  market acceptance of new products  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in product pricing  including changes in competitors pricing policies  development of our direct and indirect distribution channels  integration of acquisitions  the timing of personnel departures and new hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  and general economic conditions 
we may not be able to grow or sustain our profitability from quarter to quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in when revenue is recognized can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our business has historically tended to be seasonal  with the last quarter of the year having the highest amount of revenue and the first quarter of the year having the lowest amount of revenue 
however  the year ended december  was an unusual year  with higher revenue in the first two quarters and lower revenue in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that the weakening of the global economy in the latter part of the year and the september  terrorist attacks in new york city and washington  dc were significant factors in the timing and realization of our revenue for the global economy is weak 
the global economy is much weaker now than it has been in recent history  and the us economy may be in recession for some or all of  if not longer 
the general economic slowdown is having serious negative consequences for our business and operating results 
we believe that the economic slowdown is causing some current or potential customers to defer purchases  to go out of business or to have insufficient capital to buy our products 
in response to the current economic conditions  many companies have reduced their budget for information technology products and services  which could reduce or eliminate some potential sales of our products and services 
a continued economic slowdown could also cause a significant reduction in the value of our investments and could make it difficult for us to raise capital 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
from january  through february   our stock price has ranged from a per share high of to a low of  as adjusted to reflect our three for two stock split  payable in the form of a stock dividend on our common stock  that we effected in march a number of factors may contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including our ability to meet the expectations of brokerage firms  industry analysts and investors with respect to our operating and financial results  our public announcements and our competitors public announcements  the public s perception of the strength of the e security market and technology companies generally  
table of contents the outcome of the current sec investigation into certain matters involving rsa security  litigation developments  and general economic conditions and the volatility of the stock market in general 
in recent quarters  we have announced historical quarterly revenues or future projected revenues that failed to meet the expectations of analysts and investors  and our stock price has often declined after these announcements 
for example  as a result of lower than anticipated revenues in the quarter ended september   our operating results for the quarter were below the expectations of public market analysts and many investors  and the market price of our common stock declined substantially 
if  because of any of the factors listed above or an unanticipated cause  our operating results fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in a future quarter  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology companies generally have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
demand for our products depends on the continued growth of the market for e security solutions 
the market for some of our e security solutions is at an early stage of development 
demand for our products depends on  among other things the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  market acceptance and use of digital signatures and digital certificates in business applications  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public s perception of the need for secure electronic commerce and communications over both wired and wireless computer networks  the perceived quality  price  availability and interoperability of our products as compared to our competitors products  the perceived ability of our products to address real customer problems  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions  which  among other things  influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
changes in e security technology and standards could render our products obsolete 
the market for e security products is rapidly evolving 
e security technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products and retire old ones and as customer requirements quickly develop and change 
in addition  the industry and government standards for e commerce and network security continue to evolve 
if any market segments for our products adopt technologies or standards that are inconsistent with our products and technology  sales of our products in those market segments could decline 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new  competitively priced products and solutions with features that meet changing customer requirements  all in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in introducing new or enhanced products 
a number of factors  including the following  could have a negative impact on the success of our products quality  reliability or security failures  which could result in returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  unexpected service or warranty expenses  reduced orders and a decline in our competitive position  delays or difficulties in product development  undetected software errors or bugs in the final products shipped to our customers  which could cause market acceptance of our products to be lost or delayed  
table of contents our competitors introduction of new products ahead of our new products  or their introduction of superior or cheaper products  the market s failure to accept new technologies  including digital certificate and public and private key management technologies  our failure to include features in our products that our customers or us or foreign government regulators may require  our failure to anticipate changes in customers requirements  and the implementation of standards that are inconsistent with the technology embodied in our products 
we have needed in the past and may need in the future to purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 
we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology we need and  if we find such businesses  may not be able to purchase or license the technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
some of our products have long sales cycles 
transactions for some of our products  especially our digital certificate management and web access management products  often involve large expenditures by our customers 
some of our customers may also need to invest substantial resources and modify their computer network infrastructures to take advantage of our products 
therefore  the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable  and the long nature of the sales cycles may impact our quarterly operating results 
the sales cycles for these transactions are subject to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the amount of education regarding our products capabilities required by potential customers  customers willingness to make changes in their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products  the timing of customers budget cycles  and delays caused by customers internal review processes 
we may need to make acquisitions to remain competitive 
a component of our business strategy is to seek to buy businesses  products and technologies that complement or augment our existing businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to complete any given acquisition 
furthermore  in order to finance a potential acquisition  we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders 
we must successfully integrate our acquisitions 
we have consummated four acquisitions since january  once we complete an acquisition  the integration of the business and operations of the acquiree into our business and operations is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
before any acquisition  each company has its own business  culture  customers  employees and systems 
after an acquisition  we and the acquiree must operate as a combined organization using common communications systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
in order to successfully integrate acquired companies  we must  among other things  successfully attract and retain key personnel  integrate  both from an engineering and a sales and marketing perspective  the acquired products into our suite of product offerings  coordinate research and development efforts  train and integrate sales forces  and 
table of contents eliminate redundant costs and consolidate redundant facilities 
an acquisition may disrupt ongoing operations  divert our management from day to day business  impair our relationships with our employees  customers and strategic partners and adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  these types of transactions often result in charges to earnings for such things as amortization or impairment of goodwill and intangibles and in process research and development expenses 
international sales make up a significant portion of our business 
international sales accounted for more than of our total revenue in each of the years ended december   and we are expanding our international operations and international sales and marketing activities  and this expansion requires significant management attention and resources 
we may also need to tailor or localize our products in order to compete in particular international markets and to comply with foreign laws 
we may not be able to develop  market and distribute localized versions of our products in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including foreign regulatory requirements and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  legal uncertainty regarding liability and the costs of resolving or litigating a dispute internationally  export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology  difficulties and delays in establishing international distribution channels  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the enforcement of intellectual property rights  and political instability 
acts of terrorism or war may hurt economic conditions in the united states and abroad  which could harm our business 
our business is subject to and affected by forces  pressures and events affecting global economic conditions 
since the september  terrorist attacks in new york city and washington  dc  we have experienced delays in closing business transactions 
we believe these delays resulted  at least in part  from the september attacks 
in addition  although we can manufacture and ship our products from two locations bedford  massachusetts  usa and shannon  ireland if we were to lose the ability to operate one of these facilities  we may not be able to manufacture and ship at adequate levels to meet demand 
if the september attacks or any other future attacks or acts of war or any acts of retaliation continue to hurt global economic conditions  our business and operating results may be harmed 
our market is competitive 
we compete with established e security companies that currently offer network security products or services  newly organized e security companies that are developing new  competitive products and technologies  and established computer hardware and software companies that market their own network security products and services  either separately or bundled with their existing hardware or software products 
some of our current and potential competitors may have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to leverage an installed customer base  adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
we believe that we need to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing in order to maintain our competitive position 
we may not have sufficient resources to 
table of contents make these investments and may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  the expiration of some of our patents has permitted the use and distribution of freeware  free versions of some of our technology 
we believe that some potential customers may be choosing to use freeware instead of buying our products 
furthermore  many companies have reduced their information technology budgets due to the current economic conditions  which could make competition more intense because we are competing for fewer customer dollars 
both of these factors could result in lower prices for our products  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
we must establish and maintain strategic relationships 
one of our business strategies is to enter into strategic marketing alliances or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer population than we could reach alone through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
if we cannot create relationships with strategic partners  then we will need to devote more resources to sales and marketing 
in addition  we need to create relationships with third parties  including some of our competitors  to ensure that our products will interoperate with the third parties products 
if our products do not work with third party products used by our customers and potential customers  then our products could lose or fail to achieve market acceptance 
we may not be able to find appropriate strategic partners or may not be able to enter into potential relationships on commercially favorable terms 
furthermore  the relationships we do enter into may not be successful 
since our strategic relationships are generally non exclusive  our strategic partners may decide to pursue alternative technologies or to develop alternative products in addition to or instead of our products  either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors 
if we fail to protect our rights in our proprietary technology  competitors may use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we also generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  distributors and strategic partners as well as with our customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information  and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may nonetheless succeed at copying aspects of our products  obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary  or infringing upon our patents and other proprietary rights 
we rely on patents to protect our proprietary rights in our technology  but it is possible that any patent that we or our licensors hold might be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or terminated 
it is also possible that patent examiners might reject the claims described in our pending or future patent applications 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which our products are now  or may in the future be  developed or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  during the life of a patent  third parties may design and sell work around solutions that accomplish the goals of our patented inventions but do not infringed the patents themselves 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our issued us patents expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent  which could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
in addition  when each of our patents expires  potential customers may choose to rely on freeware  free versions of our previously patented technology  rather than buying our products 

table of contents we have registered  or are seeking to register  our trademarks and service marks in most countries where we are selling our products 
however  from time to time third parties have opposed our pending trademark and service mark applications  and we may face such opposition in the future to our current or future applications 
furthermore  some national trademark offices may not permit us to register the marks on terms that we find acceptable 
we will seek to enforce our trademark and service mark rights against third parties who are marketing goods or services under marks that we consider confusingly similar to our marks 
however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any enforcement action 
we may also seek to purchase or license trademarks from third parties  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to purchase or license trademarks on commercially favorable terms or at all 
the securities and exchange commission is investigating us 
the sec is conducting a formal investigation of whether a change in our method for estimating distributor revenue disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of should have been disclosed in our earnings press release a few weeks earlier  and of certain trading in our securities 
we are cooperating fully with the investigation 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this matter 
at a minimum  this investigation may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business 
the technology industry is highly litigious 
from time to time  we have been involved in disputes with third parties who allege that our products may infringe intellectual property rights held by the third parties 
any litigation carries a number of significant risks  including litigation is often very expensive  even if it is resolved in our favor  and litigation diverts the attention of management and other resources 
moreover  if a court or other government agency rules against us in any intellectual property litigation  we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses to the infringing technology  or pay significant monetary damages 
security technologies are under constant attack 
the strength of our cryptographic and other e security technologies is constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
any significant advance in the techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
for example  our cryptographic systems depend in part on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the security afforded by our encryption products is based on the assumption that the factoring of the composite of large prime numbers is difficult 
if an easy factoring method were developed  then the security of our encryption products would be reduced or eliminated 
even if no breakthroughs in factoring are discovered  factoring problems can theoretically be solved by a computer system significantly faster and more powerful than those currently available 
if these improved techniques for attacking cryptographic systems are ever developed  our business or operating results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our rsa ace server software and rsa securid authenticators contain a proprietary algorithm 
from time to time  we have learned of attempts by third parties to reverse engineer this algorithm to find vulnerabilities 
if a third party successfully hacks the algorithm and makes its findings public  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the published vulnerabilities 
in addition  some of our customers could require that we replace some or all of their rsa securid authenticators with authenticators that are more secure 
if we are required to make these replacements or if we cannot address the vulnerabilities in our algorithm in a timely fashion  then our business and operating results could be adversely impacted 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our product components 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some components are currently available only from limited sources 
for example  sanyo electric co  ltd 
and epson electronics are our only suppliers for the microprocessor chips contained in our rsa securid products  and flextronics and pemstar are our only manufacturers of rsa secured authenticators 
if our suppliers were unable to provide us with a sufficient supply of these or any other components and or rsa securid authenticators  then we may be unable to fill customer orders and would have to expend significant resources to find new suppliers and or manufacturers 
even if we were able to find new suppliers  these suppliers may not be able to produce the components in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
we may be subject to significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
the sale and implementation of e security solutions may entail the risk of product liability claims 
an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at our facilities or at a customer s facilities could result in a product liability claim against us 
a substantial product liability claim against us could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any actual or perceived breach of network or data security  whether or not caused by the failure of one of our products  could hurt our reputation and cause potential customers to turn to our competitors products 
we may need additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
our failure to obtain necessary financing or doing so on unattractive terms could adversely affect our development and marketing efforts and other operations 
we may need to raise additional capital in order to fund the continued development and marketing of our products or to fund strategic acquisitions or investments 
we expect that our current cash balances  availability under our bank line of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
however  we may need to obtain financing if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
our ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  reduce or defer our development activities  or delay our introduction of new products and services 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
the value of our business may fluctuate because the value of some of our assets fluctuates 
accounting standards require us to periodically evaluate the fair market value of some of our assets against the carrying value of the assets 
if these assets decline in value  we may be required to write down the carrying value of these assets  which could result in significant charges against our earnings 
in addition  a portion of our assets includes the equity securities of other companies 
the market prices and valuations of the securities we hold may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control  and these fluctuations may result in fluctuations of the market price of our common stock and may reduce the amount of funds available to us 
furthermore  the securities of the private companies in which we invest are generally illiquid  and if these private companies never achieve a liquidity event  such as a public offering or an acquisition  then we may never realize a gain on our investment or even recoup the cost of our investment 
our stockholder rights plan and some provisions of our charter may inhibit potential acquisition bids 
we have a classified board of directors and have also adopted a stockholders rights plan  both of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to complete a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company 
while these provisions are intended to enable our board to maximize stockholder value  they may have the effect of discouraging takeovers that could be in the best interest of certain stockholders and may therefore have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the 
table of contents effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in the market value of our investments  our common stock and foreign exchange rates 
market fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
we generally purchase our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us treasury and government agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and money market investments with contractual maturities of two years or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
we routinely evaluate the realizable value of these investments using qualitative and quantitative factors including discounted cash flow analysis and liquidation value assessments 
marketable securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the other comprehensive income section of stockholders equity 
the values recorded for investments in publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities at december  would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have also made equity investments approved by our board of directors 
these investments are not publicly traded and are recorded as long term investments on the balance sheet and are carried at cost  as long as our ownership interest is below 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary or mark the investment to fair value and classify them as marketable securities when appropriate 
during the year ended december   we recognized a charge of million related to certain investments that we believe have been permanently impaired  which reduced the carrying value of investments at december  at december  we had investments in private companies with a carrying value of million which are included in investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december  crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity  of which we are a member  held million shares of verisign common stock and a variable delivery forward contract  or vdf 
the vdf contract held by crosby will settle in january the vdf contract entitles us to additional cash proceeds of up to million depending on the market price of verisign common stock on january   as follows market price of verisign common stock proceeds to to to million over million we account for our investment in crosby under eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
we are carrying our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities 
fair value is being determined based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds under the vdf 
unless the verisign stock appreciates substantially in value by january  we will not be entitled to any cash flows from our remaining interest in crosby 
our remaining investment in crosby has a fair value of million at december   and is recorded in investments as a long term assets 
should our investment in crosby become worthless  we would incur a pretax charge of million  which would be included in earnings 
during we issued convertible subordinated debentures due october  with an aggregate principal amount of million  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
at any time and at their option  each holder may convert any outstanding debentures into 
table of contents shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which upon conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the holders of the warrants issued with the debentures may exercise the warrants at any time until october  at an exercise price of per share 
the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances  such as events that would cause dilution of the holder s interest 
we may redeem all or a portion of the debentures for cash at any time on or after october  as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day during the fifteen trading day period immediately prior to the election to redeem is of the conversion price 
if the convertible debentures are redeemed in part or total prior to their maturity date we will record a non cash charge for unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized value of the warrants 
at december   unamortized deferred financing costs were million and the unamortized value of the warrants was million 
interest is payable in cash semi annually at a fixed rate of per annum  and therefore we have no interest rate exposure with these debentures 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to sales and operating expenses denominated in local currencies 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars and local currencies  with the majority of our direct sales denominated in us dollars 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
for countries outside the united states  we generally pay our operating expenses in local currency 
when we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets 
this risk management discussion contains forward looking statements about our exposure to future market risk 
actual results in the future may differ materially from our anticipated results due to actual developments in global financial markets 
the analytical methods we use to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses
