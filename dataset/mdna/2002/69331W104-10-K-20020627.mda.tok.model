item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of the financial statements allowance for losses on loans and real estate 
for further information  see item lending activities allowance for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements 
asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is affected by net interest spread 
changes in net interest spread interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk policies designed to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
the board of directors approves acceptable interest rate risk levels designed to provide sufficient net interest income and net present value of shareholders equity npv assuming specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
one measure of the company s exposure to interest rate risk is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of its major assets and liabilities as of march  repricing frequencies of assets are based upon contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  and the scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments 
repricing of liabilities are based upon the contractual maturities  estimated decay rates for core deposits  and the earliest repricing opportunity for variable and floating rate instruments 
the company also had million of putable fhlb advances on the balance sheet as of march  that are assumed to reprice at maturity 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if actual experience differed from that assumed 
march  months or less more than months to months more than months to months more than months to years more than years to years more than years total fair value dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash  investment securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and fhlb stock loans and mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities loans receivable  net total loans and mortgage backed securities total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities fixed maturity deposits core deposits total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities based upon contractual maturities  repricing date and forecasted principal payments assuming normal amortization and  where applicable prepayments 
assumes of rate paying core deposits are subject to repricing in year one 
putable borrowings are presented based upon their contractual maturity date 
the company s one year gap at march   was negative ie  more interest bearing liabilities reprice within one year than interest earning assets  this compares with negative at march  a gap table is limited to measuring the timing risk and does not reflect the impact of customer options or basis risk 
to better measure the company s exposure to these and other components of interest rate risk  management relies on an internally maintained  externally supported asset liability simulation model 
the company forecasts its net interest income for the next twelve months  and its npv  assuming there are no changes in interest rates or the balance sheet structure from the current period end 
once this base case has been established  the company subjects its balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes of and basis points to the treasury yield curve 
prepayment speeds and the responsiveness of the various indices are estimated for each rate change level 
the model then re forecasts net interest income and npv 
the tables below indicate the results of the company s internal modeling of its balance sheet as of march  and the internal calculation of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if the company s response to changes in interest rates included changes in the structure of its balance sheet 
march  percentage change change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for the period from april  through march  assuming the company does not change the structure of its balance sheet 
this percentage represents the npv of the company assuming no changes to the balance sheet 
the results from the asset liability simulation model indicate that the company s net interest income would remain relatively stable under modest rate shocks in either direction 
the substantial reductions in the indices  particularly prime  to which many of the company s adjustable rate loans are tied  has resulted in many of the company s most rate sensitive assets falling below rate floors 
for yields on these assets to benefit from rate movements  rates would need to increase by more than basis points 
the rate reductions during fiscal also accelerated arm loan prepayments throughout the year 
the company replenished its one to four family residential mortgage portfolio primarily with new originations and purchases of and hybrid loans that are not expected to experience significant prepayment activity or rate adjustments during the next twelve months 
the ots produces an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports 
the results of the ots model may vary from the bank s internal model primarily due to differences between assumptions utilized in the bank s internal model and the ots model  including estimated loan market rates  prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates 
as of march   the bank s sensitivity measure  as calculated by the ots  was a negative 
this represents a decrease in sensitivity of basis points from the march  results 
average balance sheets the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended march   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are derived from average daily balances 
the yields include fees that are considered adjustments to yields

the average yield on loans receivable  net decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal approximately percent of the company s loans are adjustable rate in nature 
this excludes an additional million or percent of the portfolio that is in hybrid arms 
given the repricing profile of the loan portfolio  its yield will be directionally consistent with changes in the general level of interest rates 
the dramatically lower interest rate environment during fiscal also contributed to a significant increase in the turnover of the loan portfolio 
this turnover created an additional downward bias to the yield on the loan portfolio as older  higher yielding loans were replaced by originated or purchased loans at lower market rates 
loan principal repayments increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal loan originations increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal in response to the higher level of loan repayments  loan purchases were increased million from million during fiscal to million for fiscal continued emphasis on the four cs mitigated some of the interest rate environment driven downward movement in the yield on the loan portfolio 
the four cs increased million during fiscal to billion or percent of loans receivable  net at march  from million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  originations of the four cs totaled billion or percent of total originations for fiscal compared to million or percent of total originations for fiscal the average yield on securities decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in average yield on securities was attributable primarily to the decrease in the general level of interest rates 
the one year cmt index to which of the company s securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal three month libor  to which of the company s securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal the prime rate  to which of the company s securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal while total average interest earnings assets remained little changed between fiscal and fiscal  the average balance of loans receivable  net increased million from billion to billion and the aggregate average balance of securities decreased million from million to million 
for the past several years  the company s strategy has emphasized growth in loans and deposits with a corresponding de emphasis on wholesale leverage securities funded with fhlb advances and other borrowings 
this strategy was undertaken in connection with the company s focus on enhancing its net interest spread and earnings stream by achieving an asset base comprised to a greater extent by the four cs and a liability base comprised to a greater extent by core deposits 
strong loan origination volumes of the four cs have provided an investment alternative for the company which is preferential to securities  and is consistent with its long term strategic objectives 
between fiscal and  the proportion of total average interest earning assets comprised by loans receivable increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal concurrently  the proportion of total average interest bearing liabilities comprised by deposits increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease was attributable principally to a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of deposits decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of cds decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal and the average cost of core deposits decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal contributing to the decrease in the average cost of deposits was an increase in the proportion of the portfolio comprised by core deposits 
the average balance of core deposits grew by million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal at march   core deposits totaled billion or percent of total deposits compared to million or percent of total deposits one year earlier 
the average cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal average interest bearing liabilities decreased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the decrease in average interest bearing liabilities was attributable to a million decrease in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the average balance of total deposits increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was million for fiscal and non accrual loans were million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  non accrual loans at march  included a million loan on the residential home development in castaic  california 
during fiscal  this million loan was determined to be impaired and an allowance for loss was established for the full amount of the loan 
during fiscal  this loan was charged off  reducing total non accrual loans and the total allowance for loan losses by million 
as a result  the allowance for loan losses was little changed between march  million and march  million 
growth in the loan portfolio reduced the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans receivable from at march  to at march  had the million castaic loan been charged off at march   it would have reduced the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans at that time to  a level that would have been very comparable to the march  ratio of 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  consideration is given to levels and trends in the following factors the volume and composition of non accrual loans  the volume  severity and composition of classified assets  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio by type and by collateral 
each of these factors is discussed more fully below 
between march  and  the volume of non accrual loans decreased by million including the million reduction attributable to the charging off of the castaic loan 
the million of non accrual loans at march  includes million of loans secured by one to four family residential mortgages and million of four cs loans 
total classified assets increased from million at march  to million at march  the march  balance includes a loan in the amount of million to a business equipment leasing company 
this loan was discussed more fully under lending activities delinquencies and classified assets 
total classified assets at march  and also include loans on the castaic project aggregating million and million  respectively 
between march  and  the disbursed balance of the four cs increased by million 
this increased the proportion of loans receivable  net comprised by the four cs from percent to percent 
it also contributed to an increase in the company s average loan size from  at march  to  at march  for a discussion of the larger credits under each loan type  see lending activities 
while the level of non accrual loans decreased between march  and  the allowance for loan losses was maintained at its current level based upon the following the increase in the level and individual credit exposure of classified assets  the shift in the composition of the loan portfolio away from one to four family residential mortgages to the four cs 
non interest income non interest income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal deposit and related fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in deposit and related fees reflects the additional fee opportunities associated with the growth in core deposits 
trust fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal assets under management or custody increased from million at march  to million at march  trust fees for fiscal are net of a  non recurring downward adjustment of fees 
loan and servicing fees increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due principally to the much higher volume of loan payoff activity noted earlier 
the net loss from trading activity was  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the reduction in net loss from trading activities between fiscal and was due  in part  to the direction and magnitude of changes in the equity markets 
the better performance during fiscal was also attributable to a change in personnel and portfolio management philosophy 
non interest expense non interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased million from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal compensation and benefits accounted for million of the increase in general and administrative expense 
a portion of the increase in compensation and benefits expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal reflects the hiring of experienced personnel to generate and support the higher volumes of four cs and core deposits 
the improvement in the efficiency ratio from for fiscal to for fiscal reflects the positive relationships being achieved between revenue growth and the costs associated with properly supporting that growth 
included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal and fiscal  respectively are non cash charges of million and million associated with the bank s esop and incentive plan 
the stock awarded under the incentive plan vested over a five year period ending october accordingly  the non cash charge to expense associated with the incentive plan will decrease from the million that was recorded during fiscal to zero for fiscal the allocation of shares under the bank s esop will continue in generally equal installments through fiscal the amount charged to expense under the esop will move upward or downward with changes in the market price of the company s common stock 
esop expense for fiscal was million 
also contributing to the increase in compensation and benefits expense was a decrease in pension income from  for fiscal to  for fiscal applicable to the bank s frozen defined benefit pension plan the plan 
the decrease in pension income reflects a significant reduction in the value of plan assets  the majority of which had been invested in equity securities 
as of march   the market value of plan assets was million  compared to million at march  as of march   the projected plan benefit obligation was million compared to million at march  as a result  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march  is million applicable to the march  shortfall between plan assets and liabilities 
the company has moved a substantial portion of plan assets into fixed income investments under an investment immunization program 
this strategy is expected to significantly reduce the future earnings and asset liability value mismatch volatility arising from the plan 
the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was attributable  in part  to an increase in expenditures associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities served by the bank 
hispanic marketing expenditures for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and was attributable to the bank s opening of its twenty fourth full service branch in la quinta  california in february the bank expects to continue to expand its retail delivery network through de novo branching with at least two new branches expected to be opened during fiscal income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total assets increased million from billion at march  to billion at march  reflecting the company s strategy of increasing the loan orientation of its asset base  loans receivable  net increased million from billion at march  to billion at march   while securities decreased million from million at march  to million at march cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at march  to million at march  as a result of very strong deposit inflows during fiscal  particularly during the quarter ended march  total liabilities increased million from billion march  to billion at march  total deposits increased million from billion at march  to billion at march  the bank s emphasis on growing the lower cost  more stable segments of its deposit portfolio is reflected in a core deposit increase of million from million or percent of total deposits at march  to billion or percent of total deposits at march  fhlb advances decreased million from million at march  to million at march  total stockholders equity increased million from million at march  to million at march  the million increase is comprised principally of a million increase in retained earnings  substantially restricted  a million increase in additional paid in capital  a million decrease in unearned stock based compensation and a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the million increase in retained earnings  substantially restricted reflects net earnings of million for fiscal partially offset by million attributable to the amount paid to repurchase  shares of common stock in excess of the original issuance price of the stock 
the  shares of common stock were repurchased at a weighted average price of per share  and million of cash dividends declared during fiscal cash dividends of 
per share were declared and paid during the first two quarters of fiscal the cash dividend was increased to 
per share for the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
the million increase in additional paid in capital was attributable to a million increase representing the amounts paid by directors and officers to exercise stock options granted to them under the incentive plan along with the tax benefit to the company arising therefrom 
during fiscal options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of per share  a million increase attributable to amortization of shares under the incentive plan  and a million reduction representing the removal from additional paid in capital of the march original purchase price of the shares that were repurchased during fiscal the million decrease in unearned stock based compensation was attributable to the amortization of shares under the company s esop million and incentive plan million 
the million increase in other comprehensive loss was comprised principally of a million minimum pension liability adjustment arising from the shortfall of million between frozen defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities as of march  compared to a surplus of million as of march  the unrealized loss  net of tax on the company s portfolio of securities available for sale decreased from million at march  to million at march  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march general net earnings increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal fiscal earnings include a million pre tax gain on sale of a branch and a  impairment writedown of a marketable equity security 
additionally  gain loss on trading securities  net went from a million gain for fiscal to a million loss for fiscal excluding the gain on branch sale  impairment writedown and trading activities  net earnings would have increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the improvement in operating results between fiscal and fiscal was attributable to an increase in net interest income from million for fiscal to million for fiscal arising from expansion of effective interest spread coupled with growth in average interest earning assets 
interest income interest income increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was attributable principally to a basis point increase in yield on average interest earning assets from for fiscal to for fiscal average interest earning assets increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the average yield on loans receivable  net increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in average yield on loans receivable  net reflects the bank s continuing emphasis on the four cs as well as the impact of a generally higher interest rate environment during fiscal the four cs increased million during fiscal to million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  from million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  originations of the four cs totaled million or percent of total originations for fiscal compared to million or percent of total originations for fiscal the average yield on securities  increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in average yield on securities was attributable primarily to the increase in the general level of interest rates 
the one year cmt index averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal one month libor averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal the increase in average interest earnings assets between fiscal and fiscal was comprised principally of a million increase in the average balance of loans receivable  net from billion to billion partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of securities from million to million reflecting the company s continuing strategy of reducing wholesale leverage 
interest expense interest expense increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of deposits increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of cds increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal and the average cost of core deposits increased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the average cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increases in funding costs for deposits and fhlb advances and other borrowings reflect the increase in the general level of interest rates between fiscal and fiscal average interest bearing liabilities increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the increase in average interest bearing liabilities was comprised of a million increase in the average balance of total deposits from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings from million for fiscal to million for fiscal provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in the provision for loan losses between fiscal and fiscal was attributable in part  to an increase in the level of non accrual loans 
the bank s emphasis on the four cs has also resulted in a change in the overall risk profile of the bank s loan portfolio 
non accrual loans were million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  the allowance for loan losses was million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  non interest income non interest income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal non interest income excluding trading securities portfolio activity  the fiscal gain on branch sale and fiscal marketable equity security impairment writedown increased  or between fiscal and fiscal to million 
deposit and related fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the  decrease in deposit and related fees was attributable to a  decrease in commissions earned from sales of non deposit investment ndi products from million for fiscal to million for fiscal ndi products consist primarily of third party annuities and mutual funds 
trust fees were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal trust fees for fiscal include a  non recurring downward adjustment of fees 
gain loss on sales of assets was  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the million loss for fiscal includes the  writedown of a marketable equity security deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
loan and servicing fees of million were comparable between fiscal and higher volumes of loan payoffs during fiscal increased loan fee income in an amount comparable to the  prepayment fee received on a commercial loan during fiscal the net loss from trading activity was million for fiscal compared to a net gain of million for fiscal reflecting the dramatic change in the direction of the equity markets between the two periods 
non interest expense non interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased million or from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal compensation and benefits expense increased  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal and fiscal  respectively are non cash charges of million and million associated with the bank s esop and incentive plan 
the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was attributable  in part  to fiscal expenditures of  associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities served by the bank 
hispanic marketing expenditures for fiscal are expected to equal or exceed the fiscal level 
the  decrease in other non interest expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was due primarily to office supplies expense 
income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings  proceeds from the maturation of securities and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of loans 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage and security prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
effective july  the ots adopted a rule eliminating the statutory liquidity requirement 
in its place  the ots adopted a policy  consistent with that of the other federal banking regulatory agencies  that liquidity be maintained at a level which provides for safe and sound banking practices and financial flexibility 
the bank s average regulatory liquidity ratios were  and for the years ended march   and  respectively 
management s strategy is to invest excess liquidity in higher yielding interest earning assets  such as loans or other investments  depending on market conditions 
the bank has invested in corporate securities when the yields thereon have been more attractive than us government and federal agency securities of similar maturity 
while corporate securities are not backed by any government agency  the maturity structure and credit quality of all corporate securities owned by the bank meet the minimum standards set forth by the ots for regulatory liquidity qualifying investments 
the bank has invested in callable debt issued by federal agencies of the us government when the yields thereon to call date s and maturity exceeded the yields on comparable term and credit quality non callable investments by amounts which management deems sufficient to compensate the bank for the call options inherent in the securities 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and purchases of mortgage backed and other investment securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from maturation of investments and paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
principal payments on loans were billion  billion and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
disbursements on loans originated and purchased  excluding loans originated for sale  were billion  billion and billion for the years ended march   and  respectively 
disbursements for purchases of mortgage backed and other investment securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
proceeds from the maturation of investment securities and paydowns of mbs and cmo were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in financing activities consisted primarily of net activity in deposit accounts and fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the net increases in deposits were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the net increases decreases in fhlb advances and other borrowings were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
at march   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
see item description of business regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the utilization of reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances 
at march   the bank had million of fhlb advances outstanding 
based upon pledged collateral in place  the company had available borrowing capacity of million as of march  no collateral was pledged under reverse repurchase agreements at march  other sources of liquidity include securities maturing within one year 
the company currently has no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures

certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled million 
the bank expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificate accounts will be retained by the bank at maturity 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts or market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
