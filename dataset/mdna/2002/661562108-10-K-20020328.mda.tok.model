the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
certain information included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report is forward looking  such as information relating to the effects of regulation and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on the estimates and assumptions of management and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the registrant s actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in or implied by these forward looking statements 
a results of operations 
net earnings for were  or 
per share  compared to net earnings of  or 
per share for and  or 
per share for these fluctuations were attributable to the following factors operating revenues 
total operating revenues increased  during this increase was primarily the result of increases in local network services of   long distance and access services of   telecommunications equipment sales of and other operating revenues of   offset partially by a decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services of 
increases in local network service revenues of  or  were attributable to several factors  one of which was a rate band reclass at nptc which received pa puc approval and became effective in december of as the density of customers in nptc s serving area and immediate surrounding territories covered by extended area service agreements increased during the late s and  several of the exchanges in nptc s territory grew into the next rate band and qualified for an increase in local rates  which contributed approximately  of the  increase in nptc s basic area revenues 
the remainder of the increase was due to a higher average number of lines in service than the prior year as well as nptc s revenue neutral chapter filing  which became effective in december of and added approximately  with a corresponding decrease in long distance and access services 
also  penn telecom s basic area revenues increased  due to continued successful penetration south of nptc s territory in the city of pittsburgh and surrounding areas as well as north of nptc s territory in the city of butler  pa 
penn telecom s basic access lines installed increased from  as of december   to  as of december  in addition  primary rate interface pri circuits grew from circuits to circuits over the same period 
in addition  vertical feature revenues increased in  due to continued penetration in nptc s existing territory as well as growth in the number of customers at penn telecom 
the increase in long distance and access service revenues of  or  was attributable to an increase in high capacity circuits sold special access revenues and an increase in access minutes for both nptc and penn telecom  offset partially by lower toll revenues 
special access revenues increased  at nptc and  at penn telecom  mostly as a result of large increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold 
interstate and intrastate access revenues increased approximately  mostly as a result of increased access revenues at penn telecom due to the growth in customers producing originating and terminating access revenues 
toll revenues decreased approximately due to a decrease in intralata toll revenues at nptc  partially offset by a growth in both intralata and interlata toll revenues at penn telecom 
the decrease in intralata toll revenues at nptc was mostly a result of a decrease in market share and loss of minutes of use to such competition as cellular and to a decrease in the average billed rate due to the development of additional calling plans to meet the competitive environment 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in both intralata and interlata toll revenues at penn telecom due to the successful bundling of toll with local calling packages 
as of december   of penn telecom s clec customers subscribed to one of its toll packages 
telecommunications equipment sales increased  or  due to an increase in private branch exchange and additional equipment sales 
the majority of the increase was due to partially depressed sales for the year ended december   as a result of accelerated purchases in and to address potential yk concerns 
the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to the growth in dsl revenues of  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail increased from  as of december   to  as of december  in addition  net uncollectible revenue charges decreased due to improved cash collection from both retail customers as well as carriers 
the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services of  or  was mostly due to a decrease of in carrier billing and collection revenues 
nptc has contracts with several interexchange carriers and other telecommunications companies in which it earns fees for performing billing and collection services on behalf of these companies 
nptc has seen the volume of services and calls billed on behalf of these companies decrease in the past year  mostly as a result of more companies bringing these functions in house 
total operating revenues increased  during this increase was primarily the result of increases in local network services of   long distance and access services of  and other operating revenues of  offset partially by a decrease in telecommunications equipment sales of 
increased local network service revenues were attributable to customer growth for both nptc and penn telecom  growth in second lines and expanded penetration of enhanced services 
higher long distance and access services were attributable to an increase in the number of customers and minutes of use for both nptc and penn telecom  and an increase in high capacity circuits sold 
the increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to the growth of internet access customers and an increase in both wholesale and retail dsl lines 
telecommunications equipment sales decreased as a result of lower key system  private branch exchange and additional equipment sales  mostly due to partially depressed sales as a result of accelerated purchases in and to address potential yk concerns 
operating expenses and net revenues 
total operating expenses for increased  over the preceding year 
the change was primarily the result of increases in network and other operating expenses of  depreciation and amortization expenses of and telecommunications equipment expenses of  offset partially by a decrease in state and local taxes of 
the increase in network and other operating expenses of  or  was due to increased expenses at penn telecom  partially offset by decreases in expenses at nptc and pinnatech 
clec variable costs at penn telecom  such as the leasing of unbundled network elements unes for non facilities based access lines increased with the overall growth in access lines and revenue 
collocation costs also increased as penn telecom expanded into additional incumbent central offices during in addition  personnel and operating costs grew larger in order to support the revenue growth and overall growth of the network 
at nptc  network and other operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  from the prior year due to a cost reduction program instituted in the first quarter of as mentioned under the regulatory matters section of this report paragraph c of this section  the clear intent of the act as well as some current fcc and pa puc regulatory proceedings is to open up the telecommunications market to competition 
although nptc has yet to see any material impact on its revenues or loss of access lines  it has adopted a pro active approach to cost reduction 
the cost reduction program involved not only the elimination of direct external expenses such as a large reduction in the use of outside contractors  but also involved improving operating procedures 
internal processes and procedures have been re engineered to maximize both labor and material usage as well as inventory levels 
in addition  with the recent completion of the five year modernization of nptc s network during  maintenance expense has decreased from prior year levels as legacy equipment has been upgraded and or replaced 
at pinnatech  network and other operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased approximately  from the prior year 
the decrease was a result of the cessation of costs related to the operating activities and eventual shut down of the nauticom sports network nsn in december of the growth in depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the direct result of the growth in fixed assets to service current and future customer needs 
the registrant has made gross property additions of million over the past five years to implement state of the art switching transmission and transport facilities  an extensive fiber network  broadband capability via dsl technology to of nptc s lines and to support the build out of the penn telecom clec operations 
the increase in telecommunications and equipment expense of  or  was a direct result of the increase in telecommunications equipment sales of 
the decrease in state and local taxes of  or  was mostly attributable to a reduction in public utility realty tax assessment purta expense in from a settled prior year overpayment as well as a decrease in pennsylvania capital stock tax due to a reduction in millage rates from the prior year 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a increase in net operating revenues in as compared to total operating expenses for increased  over the preceding year 
the change was primarily the result of increases in network and other operating expenses of  and depreciation and amortization expenses of   offset partially by a decrease in telecommunications equipment expenses of 
the increase in network and other operating expenses resulted from several factors 
first  there was an increase in personnel and operating costs due to an expansion of the existing nptc business to service the needs of its territory which is located within a growing commercial and residential market 
penn telecom s operating expenses also grew larger with an increase in personnel and other expenses due to start up activities associated with the growth of its clec in its foothold north of the city of pittsburgh as well as an expansion into the city of pittsburgh and all surrounding areas 
this expansion was facilitated through the implementation of a long term strategic relationship with an electric utility to lease fiber optic loops throughout the entire pittsburgh region 
the operating expenses of pinnatech also increased as a result of the expansion of its internet related activities and attempted expansion of its nsn 
the nsn was closed in the fourth quarter of as discussed in more detail in paragraph c of this section  resulting in a pre tax restructuring charge of in network and other operating expenses 
finally  advertising expense increased approximately million from as the registrant promoted the expansion effort described above for all companies which in turn contributed to the overall revenue growth of  in as compared to revenue growth of  in the growth in depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the direct result of the growth in fixed assets to service current and future customer needs 
the registrant made gross property additions of million during the five year period from january  through december  for the purpose  inter alia  of implementing state of the art switching transmission and transport facilities  an extensive fiber network  broadband capability via dsl technology and to support the build out of penn telecom s clec operations 
the decrease in telecommunications and equipment expenses of was a direct result of the decrease in telecommunications equipment sales of 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a decrease in net operating revenues in as compared to other items 
interest expense increased in by due to increased debt borrowings 
interest income decreased in primarily due to the liquidation of available for sale debt securities and the general decrease in short term money market rates for temporary investments during the net decrease in sundry income of  was primarily due to a  decrease in realized gains on the sale of securities as the majority of the registrant s available for sale equity portfolio was liquidated in the prior year  a decrease in dividend income from not holding those equity securities in  and in non operating expenses associated with tax adjustments to prior years cellular parternships returns 
interest expense increased in by due to increased debt borrowings 
interest income increased in primarily due to increased investments in temporary fixed income  as opposed to equity  securities 
the net decrease in sundry income of was primarily due to one time gains recorded in from a cellular partnership transaction and the sale of nptc s remaining pay phone business  offset in part by higher realized gains on the sale of available for sale securities in b liquidity and capital resources 
december  cash and temporary investments   working capital   long term debt including current maturities   cash and temporary investments were  at december  as compared to  at december  the increase was due to the strong cash flows from operations of  an increase of  from the prior year  the liquidation of available for sale securities throughout the year  with the proceeds being reinvested into temporary investments  and an  decrease in capital expenditures during the decrease in capital expenditures was mostly a result of the completion of a five year network modernization plan in which north pittsburgh established new carrier serving areas  installed over route miles of fiber and over route miles of copper and upgraded central office equipment with state of the art products and technologies 
north pittsburgh  through its modernization plan  not only improved the quality of the voice services and enhanced features available to its customers  but also upgraded its network to provide dsl capability to over of its existing access lines 
the year marked the return to a more normalized level of capital expenditures for north pittsburgh  a level that should continue into the foreseeable future 
temporary excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents with maturity dates scheduled to coincide with tax payment due dates  debt principal payments  etc 
management expects to continue the investment of such excess funds in  which should enable the registrant to satisfactorily meet all short term obligations 
working capital was  at december  as compared to  at december  the increase in working capital was a result of the increase in cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures  as described previously in this section  as well as a decrease in the restructuring liabilities associated with the shut down of the nsn in december of the increase in long term debt was a result of  of funds advanced to finance capital additions  offset by the scheduled  of principal repayments in in  north pittsburgh was granted approval for a loan from the federal financing bank ffb guaranteed by the rural utilities service rus in the maximum principal amount of million 
the maximum principal amount has been and will be advanced periodically over a total six year period for qualified capital expenditure projects  as defined in the loan agreement  to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas 
all advances have a maturity date of december  the total amount outstanding at december  to the ffb under this loan was  as of december   north pittsburgh had  of qualified capital expenditures that were eligible to be drawn against this facility 
in addition  north pittsburgh had principal payments outstanding of  at december  from loan advances from the rural telephone bank rtb made from through the advances from the rtb have maturity dates ranging from through the notes payable to the rtb are secured by a supplemental mortgage agreement executed by north pittsburgh  which provides that substantially all of the property  plant and equipment of north pittsburgh  which approximates a net book value of million  are subject to a lien or a security interest 
such agreement contains restrictions regarding dividends and other distributions by north pittsburgh 
under these restrictions  unless certain working capital and net worth levels are maintained  north pittsburgh is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock other than in shares of capital stock  or to make any other distributions to its shareholders or purchase  redeem or retire any of its capital stock or make any investment in affiliated companies 
as a result of these restrictions   of north pittsburgh s retained earnings were available for dividends to the registrant as of december  taking into consideration the north pittsburgh restrictions  consolidated retained earnings of the registrant of approximately  were available for dividends and other distributions to shareholders as of december  the original six year advancement period for the rus loan ends in november of  at which time north pittsburgh has the option of executing a three year extension of the advancement period through november of the unadvanced amount of this facility as of december  was  north pittsburgh also has available through june of a million line of credit with the rural telephone finance cooperative at a rate of prime plus 
no borrowings have taken place against this line of credit 
a summary of the registrant s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  is as follows debt principal capital lease thereafter   capital expenditure commitments for the purchase and installation of new equipment at december  amounted to approximately million  with such amount being part of the construction program  which is projected to be in the range of million to million 
management expects cash flows provided by operating activities and cash reserves in to be sufficient to service long term debt and capital lease obligations  to pay dividends and to finance all non rus qualified projects 
the registrant has the necessary cash flows from operations and cash reserves to internally finance of its capital expenditures 
however  due to the low cost financing available through the rus for qualified north pittsburgh capital expenditures  the registrant may continue to request advancements from the rus facility 
c other information 
critical accounting policies 
certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when local network  long distance  and access services are provided 
local service and intrastate long distance and access service revenues are subject to the jurisdiction of the pa puc 
the registrant participates in interstate pooling arrangements with other telephone companies 
such pools are funded by access service charges regulated by the fcc 
revenue earned through pooling is initially recorded based on estimates 
the registrant has settled substantially all access service arrangements through revenues from equipment sales are recorded after equipment has been installed and accepted by the customer 
nonrefundable up front activation fees associated with the provisioning of telephone service  when material  are deferred and recognized over the expected term of the customer relationship 
impairment of long lived assets based upon the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the registrant reviews assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment if any is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
the registrant determined that there was no impairment to the carrying value of such assets in  or valuation of accounts receivable management reviews accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the registrant s accounts receivable aging schedules  history of write offs  relationships with its customers and the overall credit worthiness of its customers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
see additional discussions in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
nsn restructuring 
in the fourth quarter of  the registrant shutdown the nsn 
the sports network division of pinnatech had been providing broadcasts of high school and small college sporting events as well as other sports programming 
during  the nsn had expanded its coverage from western pennsylvania into several other states 
although the growth in the popularity of the site and concept met management s expectations  the revenue generating model  based mostly on advertising revenues  failed to support the projected level of continued capital investment and operating expenses 
a pretax charge of was recorded during in network and other operating expenses to cover the restructuring costs associated with the shutdown of the nsn 
the total charges reduced net income by the business restructuring charge of included restructuring liabilities of and asset impairments of the restructuring liabilities consisted of for employee severance payments and related taxes for people who were involuntarily terminated  for future operating lease expense associated with a leased facility under contract which will no longer be used and for other charges associated with the restructuring 
as of december   all employees had been terminated and all severance payments and related taxes had been paid 
during  the registrant satisfied all remaining obligations with the exception of the remaining future operating lease payments 
total net cash expenditures during totaled an additional net was recorded as expense in  due primarily to the settlement of a contract for satellite equipment and airtime above the registrant s original estimate and the inability to generate the estimated sub lease contracts for the facility under lease  offset partially by the sale of nsn fixed assets with a net book value of for a gain 
as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual liability was regulatory matters 
both north pittsburgh and penn telecom are subject to regulatory oversight by the pa puc for intrastate services and the fcc for interstate services 
the pa puc and the fcc have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities  rates and charges  securities  the encumbering or disposition of public utility properties  accounting and various other matters 
in  congress passed the act  which has the goal of opening the telecommunications industry to further competition for all services 
the act prohibits state legislative or regulatory restrictions or barriers to entry regarding the provision of local telephone service 
it also requires most incumbent local exchange carriers to interconnect with the networks of other telecommunications carriers  unbundle their services into network elements  offer their telecommunications services at wholesale rates to allow the resale of such services and allow other telecommunications carriers to locate equipment on their premises 
local exchange telephone carriers are also required to compensate each other for the transport and termination of calls 
the fcc has issued a number of rulemakings that continue to implement the requirements of the act 
the clear intent of the act was to open up the local exchange market to competition 
the act appears to mandate  among other items  that north pittsburgh  at some point in time  permit the resale of its services at wholesale rates  provide number portability  if feasible  provide dialing parity  provide interconnection to any requesting carrier for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access and provide access to network elements 
north pittsburgh s wireline operations are considered rural under the act and are exempt from certain of the foregoing obligations unless  in response to a bona fide request for interconnection  the pa puc removes that exemption 
north pittsburgh along with other rural companies in pennsylvania was granted a temporary suspension to july  of certain interconnection requirements in the act applicable to incumbent local exchange carriers as they relate to non facilities based competition 
the provision of interstate toll and access services by north pittsburgh and penn telecom is subject to the regulatory scrutiny of the fcc 
terms  conditions and rates for interstate toll and access services are filed in interstate tariffs for review and approval by the fcc 
however  effective august   the fcc no longer requires non dominant interstate toll providers  including penn telecom  to file tariffs for their interstate toll services 
penn telecom now informs its toll customers of the rates  terms and conditions through written notice to its customers 
in october of  the fcc adopted an order referred to as the multi association group  or mag order  that modified the interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return ror incumbent lecs 
north pittsburgh is subject to this order 
according to the fcc  the new rules  which went into effect january   are intended to accomplish the following three goals align the interstate access rate structure more closely with the manner in which costs for access are incurred  replace implicit support for universal service with explicit support that is portable to all eligible telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral basis  and provide certainty and stability for small and mid sized local telephone companies serving rural and high cost areas by permitting these carriers to continue to set rates based on a ror of  thereby encouraging investment in rural america 
the mag order had the following effects increased flat rate charges referred to as subscriber line charges slcs that are billed to residential and business customers  and decreased per minute of use switched access charges billed to interexchange toll providers that originate and terminate traffic on the lecs network 
the mag order also created a new universal service support mechanism  interstate common line support icls 
the icls will replace the carrier common line ccl charge  which was previously billed to interexchange toll providers 
the icls will be phased in beginning july of and the ccl will be eliminated as of july of the initial effect of the implementation of the mag order on north pittsburgh is expected to be revenue neutral 
a number of parties have filed petitions for reconsideration regarding certain issues contained in the mag order 
the outcome of these petitions is unknown at this time 
because the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain at this time  north pittsburgh is unable to predict the specific long term effect that the mag order will have on its revenues and operations 
penn telecom  as a clec  was not directly affected by the mag order  as it does not currently offer services in the areas served by incumbent lecs that were subject to the order 
at the same time the mag order was adopted  the fcc also issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on an incentive regulation plan for incumbent lecs which are now under ror regulation in the interstate jurisdiction 
because the outcome of this proceeding is not yet known  north pittsburgh is not able to predict the specific effect that it will have on its operations and revenues 
in february of  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm regarding the possible classification of wireline broadband internet access as an information service rather than a telecommunications service 
should the fcc adopt this finding  it may remove network based broadband offerings such as dsl services from regulation under the fcc act 
such deregulation of broadband services would generally be viewed as favorable to north pittsburgh in that these broadband services would not have to be offered to competing clecs on an unbundled basis 
however  in the nprm  the fcc also asked whether it should extend universal service fund usf requirements to not only facilities based wireline broadband internet service providers bisps  but also wireless  cable tv and satellite bisps 
should the fcc extend a usf contribution requirement to all bisps  both north pittsburgh and penn telecom would be affected 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  neither north pittsburgh nor penn telecom is able to determine the specific effect such action would have on their operations and revenues 
in february of  the fcc issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the possible reformation of the system for assessing and recovering usf funds 
in addition to asking whether bisps should contribute as described above  the fcc has also asked for comment on whether it should assess carrier contributions based on the number and capacity of connections that contributing carriers provide to customers  rather than on the current method which is based on the interstate revenues they earn 
should the fcc move to reform the current system for assessing and recovering usf funds  both north pittsburgh and penn telecom would be affected by the change 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  neither north pittsburgh nor penn telecom is able to determine the specific effect such action would have on their operations and revenues 
effective january   north pittsburgh moved from ror regulation in the intrastate jurisdiction to an alternative form of regulation  which is a price cap plan 
under north pittsburgh s price cap plan  rates for non competitive intrastate services are allowed to increase based on an index that measures economy wide price increases less a productivity offset 
there is no limitation on earnings under this plan 
the terms of the plan also allow north pittsburgh to rebalance rates once each year in order to allow north pittsburgh to gradually realign its intrastate rate structure on a more rational basis in order to meet future competition 
in addition  as competition develops in the future  north pittsburgh may file with the pa puc to declare certain services competitive and thereby be freed from all rate regulation for those services 
in return for approval of the alternative form of regulation  north pittsburgh has committed to continue to upgrade its network in the future to ensure that all its customers will have access to broadband services 
while there is no immediate impact to north pittsburgh s operations and revenues under the price cap plan  it is north pittsburgh s view that the plan as approved will aid north pittsburgh in meeting competition in the future
