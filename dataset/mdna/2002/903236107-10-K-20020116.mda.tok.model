we also have available million of foreign nols 
these nols are available only to offset income earned in foreign jurisdictions and expire at various dates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax liability decreased primarily because of a change in tax accounting for unbilled fees and an expiring adjustment due to a change in accounting method 
the net change in the total valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for the fiscal year ended october   was a decrease of million due to the utilization of domestic net operating losses and a decrease of million due to current and prior year foreign losses utilized 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had working capital of million  an increase of million from october  as a professional services organization  we are not capital intensive 
capital expenditures historically have been for computer aided design  accounting and project management information systems  and general purpose computer equipment to accommodate our growth 
capital expenditures  excluding purchases financed through capital leases  during fiscal years   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to have capital outlays consistent with our resulting relative growth 
substantially all of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a result  funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations are provided in large part by distributions or advances from our subsidiaries 
under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and reporting requirements of the subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries 
our liquidity and capital measurements are set forth below years ended october  dollars in thousands working capital    working capital ratio to to to average days to convert billed accounts receivable to cash percentage of debt to equity our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million at october   a decrease of million from october  during the fiscal year ended october   we generated million from operations  received million of proceeds from sales of subsidiaries and generated million of proceeds from sales of common stock and exercises of stock options 
we used million to repay debt and million for capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended october   cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
we borrowed various amounts that totaled in aggregate million and paid off the entire outstanding balance under our revolving line of credit by the end of the fiscal year 
we intend to satisfy our working capital needs primarily through internal cash generation 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under the senior collateralized credit facility  if necessary 
our primary uses of cash are to fund our working capital and capital expenditures and to service our debt 
we believe that our existing financial resources  which primarily includes our planned cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities  will provide sufficient resources to fund our operations and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
during the fiscal year ended october   we paid million for the purchase of d m 
to fund this transaction and to refinance outstanding bank debt  we incurred new borrowings of million from the establishment of a long term senior collateralized credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank  na the bank and from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we sold  shares of our series b preferred stock to rcba strategic partners  lp for an aggregate consideration of million 
senior collateralized credit facility 
the senior collateralized credit facility was funded on june  funding date and provides for three term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million

principal amounts under term loan a became due  commencing on october   in the amount of approximately million per quarter for the subsequent three quarters 
commencing on october  and through june   annual principal payments under term loan a range from million to a maximum of million with term loan a expiring and the then outstanding principal amount becoming due and repayable in full on june  principal amounts under term loan b became due  commencing on october   in the amount of million in each year through july   with term loan b expiring and the then outstanding principal amount becoming due and repayable in full in equal quarterly installments beginning on october  principal amounts under term loan c became due  commencing on october   in the amount of million in each year through july   with term loan c expiring and the then outstanding principal amount becoming due and repayable in full in equal quarterly installments beginning on october  the revolving credit facility expires and is repayable in full on june  the term loans each bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  any of the base rate  libor or the adjusted sterling rate  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin adjusts according to a performance pricing grid based on our ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the base rate is defined as the higher of the bank s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus 
libor is defined as the offered quotation by first class banks in the london interbank market to the bank for dollar deposits  as adjusted for reserve requirements 
the adjusted sterling rate is defined as the rate per annum displayed by reuters at which sterling is offered to the bank in the london interbank market as determined by the british bankers association 
we may determine which interest rate options to use and which interest periods will apply for both the term loans and the revolving credit facility 
at october   our revolving credit facility with the bank provided for advances up to million 
at october   we had outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  which reduced the amount available to us under our revolving credit facility to million 
the senior collateralized credit facility is governed by affirmative and negative covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on incurring additional debt  paying dividends  or making distributions to our stockholders  repurchasing or retiring capital stock and making subordinated junior debt payments  as well as other restrictions 
the financial covenants include maintenance of a minimum current ratio of to  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to  an ebitda minimum of million and a maximum leverage ratio of to for the fiscal year ended october  we are required to submit quarterly compliance certification to the bank 
we were fully compliant with these covenants as of october  senior subordinated notes

we may redeem any of the notes beginning may  the initial redemption price is of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the redemption price will decline each year after and will be of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest beginning on may  in addition  at any time prior to may   we may redeem up to of the principal amount of the notes with net cash proceeds from the sale of capital stock 
the redemption price will be equal to of the principal amount of the redeemed notes

we are exposed to risk of changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under the senior collateralized credit facility 
we have entered into interest rate derivatives to protect against the risk 
at october   the only derivative instrument we held was an interest rate cap agreement relating to million of our libor bank term loan borrowings 
from an economic standpoint  the cap agreement provided us with protection against libor interest rate increases above

enterprise resource program erp 
during the current year  we commenced a project to consolidate all of our accounting and project management information systems 
the costs of implementing this project  including hardware  software licenses  consultants  internal staffing costs and training  are estimated to be approximately million  to be incurred over the next two years 
as of october   we incurred a total of approximately million for this project 
we have been financing a substantial portion of these costs through capital lease arrangements with various lenders and plan on continuing to do so 
if  and to the extent  that financing cannot be obtained through capital leases  we will draw on our line of credit as alternative financing for expenditures to be incurred for this project 
acquisitions in june  we acquired d m for cash and debt of million 
in millions purchase price of d m net of debt acquisition costs net of financing fees fair value of assets acquired incremental additional excess purchase price over net assets acquired d m historical goodwill  net aggregate goodwill during the fiscal year ended october   we provided for million of costs in connection with the acquisition of d m and our reorganization plans to integrate d m s operations 
these costs consist of project claims and cost over runs  lease fees  severance and miscellaneous items 
these reserves were substantially utilized during the fiscal year ended october  risk factors that could affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form k  the following factors could affect our actual results our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of october   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness following consummation of the d m acquisition and the related financing plan 
this level of indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following o it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  o it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  o we could be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  o it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy  and o a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes 
to service our indebtedness we require a significant amount of cash 
the ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements  we may need to seek additional financing or sell assets 
this need may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
without this financing  we could be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances 
our senior collateralized credit facility and our obligations under the notes limit our ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from any such sale 
moreover  the senior collateralized credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
furthermore  substantial portions of our assets are  and may continue to be  intangible assets 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our assets could be sold quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our debt obligations 
restrictive covenants in our senior collateralized credit facility and the indenture relating to the notes may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 
our senior collateralized credit facility and indenture relating to the notes restrict our ability  among other things  to o incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations  o pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  o repurchase or redeem our stock  o make investments  o grant liens  o make capital expenditures  o enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  o sell assets  and o acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies 
in addition  our senior collateralized credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we may not be able to maintain these ratios 
additionally  covenants in the senior collateralized credit facility and the indenture relating to the notes may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other favorable business activities 
if we default under our various debt obligations  the lenders could require immediate repayment of the entire principal 
if the lenders require immediate repayment of the entire principal  we will not be able to repay them  and our inability to meet our debt obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive approximately of our revenues from contracts with government agencies 
any disruption in government funding or in our relationship with those agencies could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our debt obligations 
we derive approximately of our revenues from local  state and federal government agencies 
the demand for our services will be directly related to the level of government program funding that is allocated to rebuild and expand the nation s infrastructure 
we believe that the success and further development of our business depends upon the continued funding of these government programs and upon our ability to participate in these government programs 
we cannot assure you that governments will have the available resources to fund these programs  that these programs will continue to be funded even if governments have available financial resources  or that we will continue to win government contracts 
some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually  so we cannot assure you of our continued work under these contracts in the future 
unsuccessful bidders may protest or challenge the award of these contracts 
in addition  government agencies can terminate these contracts at their convenience 
as a result  we may incur costs in connection with the termination of these contracts and suffer a loss of business 
also  contracts with government agencies are subject to substantial regulation and an audit of actual costs incurred 
consequently  there may be a downward adjustment in our revenues if actual recoverable costs exceed billed recoverable costs 
we have a responsibility to maintain our eligibility to perform government contracts 
from time to time allegations of improper conduct in connection with government contracting have been made against us  and these allegations could be the subjects of suspension or debarment consideration 
we investigate all such allegations thoroughly and believe that appropriate actions have been taken in all cases 
additionally  we maintain a compliance program in an effort to assure that no improper conduct occurs in connection with government contracting 
we may be unable to estimate accurately our cost in performing services for our clients 
this may cause us to have low profit margins or incur losses 
we submit some proposals on projects with an estimate of the costs that we will likely incur 
to the extent we cannot control overhead  general and administrative and other costs  or if we underestimate such costs  we may have low profit margins or may incur losses 
we are subject to risks from changes in environmental legislation  regulation and governmental policies 
federal laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  cercla  and various state and local laws  strictly regulate the handling  removal  treatment and transportation of toxic and hazardous substances and impose liability for environmental contamination caused by such substances 
moreover  so called toxic tort litigation has increased markedly in recent years as people injured by hazardous substances seek recovery for personal injuries or property damage 
we handle  remove  treat and transport toxic or hazardous substances 
consequently  we may be exposed to claims for damages caused by environmental contamination 
federal and state laws  regulations  and programs related to environmental issues will generate  either directly or indirectly  much of our environmental business 
accordingly  a reduction of these laws and regulations  or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding  implementation or enforcement of these programs  could have a material effect on our business 
environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies remained essentially unchanged during fiscal year  including further deferral of congressional reauthorization of cercla 
the outlook for congressional action on cercla legislation in fiscal year remains unclear 
our liability for damages due to legal proceedings may be significant 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover this risk 
various legal proceedings are pending against us alleging  among other things  breaches of contract or negligence in connection with our performance of professional services 
in some actions  punitive or treble damages are sought that substantially exceed our insurance coverage 
if we sustain damages greater than our insurance coverage  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our engineering practices  including general engineering and civil engineering services  involve professional judgments about the nature of soil conditions and other physical conditions  including the extent to which toxic and hazardous materials are present and the probable effect of procedures to mitigate problems or otherwise affect those conditions 
if the judgments and the recommendations based upon those judgments are incorrect  we may be liable for resulting damages that our clients incur 
the failure to attract and retain key professional personnel could adversely affect our business 
the ability to attract  retain and expand our staff of qualified technical professionals is an important factor in determining our future success 
a shortage of professionals qualified in certain technical areas exists from time to time in the engineering and design industry 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to continue to attract and retain such professionals 
in addition  we rely heavily upon the experience and ability of our senior executive staff and the loss of a significant number of such individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to compete successfully in our industry 
we are engaged in highly fragmented and very competitive markets in our service areas 
we compete with firms of various sizes  some of which are larger than us and possess greater resources 
furthermore  the engineering and design industry is undergoing consolidation  particularly in the united states of america 
these competitive forces could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect the results from these operations and our overall business 
as a worldwide provider of engineering services  we have operations in over countries and derive approximately of our revenues from international operations 
international business is subject to the customary risks associated with international transactions  including political risks  local laws and taxes  the potential imposition of trade or currency exchange restrictions  tariff increases and difficulties or delays in collecting accounts receivable 
weak foreign economies and or a weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additional acquisitions may adversely affect our ability to manage our business 
historically  we have completed numerous acquisitions and  in implementing our business strategy  we may continue to do so in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will identify  finance and complete additional suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms 
we may not successfully integrate future acquisitions 
any acquisitions may require substantial attention from our management  which may limit the amount of time that management can devote to daily operations 
our inability to find additional attractive acquisition candidates or to effectively manage the integration of any businesses acquired in the future could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our accounting and project management systems 
we are in the process of designing  testing and installing a company wide accounting and project management system 
in the event we do not complete the project successfully  we may experience reduced cash flow due to an inability to issue invoices to our customers and collect cash in a timely manner 
external factors may affect our ability to conduct business 
recent terrorist attacks on the united states of america present a potential threat to communication systems  information technology and security  damage to buildings and their contents and injury to or death of key employees 
we may need to take steps to increase security and add necessary protections against terrorist threats 
although built to structural standards  our facilities are physically vulnerable to a terrorist attack 
significant structural damage to our facilities could cause a disruption of our information systems and loss of financial data and certain customer data  which may affect our ability to conduct business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our senior collateralized credit facility 
if market rates average more in fiscal year than in fiscal year  our net of tax interest expense  after considering the effect of the interest rate cap agreement  would increase by approximately million 
conversely  if market rates average less in fiscal year than in fiscal year  our net of tax interest expense would decrease by approximately million
