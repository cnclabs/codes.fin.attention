item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following includes a number of forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
we use words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  and intends  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this prospectus 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions 
for a description of these risks  see the section entitled risk factors below 
overview we released our first internet solutions  care management system and free benchmarking  in since our first release  we have signed over million in multi year contracts with customers for our solutions and services 
in march  we formed our care data exchange line  and have entered into a million contract with the california healthcare foundation to develop our care data exchange technology and business model 
in the fall of  we formed our lifecycle decision system line 
in the fall of  we terminated our caresense and careleader lines 
we have not generated any revenues from the lifecycle decision system  caresense or careleader lines 
we have commenced sales of the lifecycle decision system 
we generate revenues from subscriptions to our internet based proprietary technology applications and hosting of customer data  as well as from consulting services and development agreements 
we sell our solutions individually or as an integrated suite of solutions and services 
we price our subscription services on a per encounter basis  such as the number of a hospital s patient admissions or outpatient visits 
our subscription agreements typically cover an initial three to five year period with provisions for automatic renewals 
we recognize training and implementation fees  as well as subscriptions and related hosting revenues  on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract 
we recognize consulting fees as the program or service is delivered and development revenues on a cost to cost basis over the entire agreement period 
our contracts generally provide for payment in advance of services rendered 
therefore  we record these payments as deferred revenues and recognize these payments when earned in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
our deferred revenue balances were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
more than health care organizations subscribe to our services 
our contract with the california healthcare foundation represented approximately of our revenues 
we have incurred substantial research and development costs since inception and have also invested in our corporate infrastructure to support our long term growth strategy 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue at historic or greater levels as we further our product development and sales and marketing efforts 
accordingly  we expect to continue to incur quarterly net losses for the foreseeable future 
since inception  we have incurred cumulative net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any material tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized  expire from through federal tax laws impose significant restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding these carryforwards 
on june  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering on july  on january  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of strategic outcomes services  inc  a pharmaeconomic consulting company located in north carolina 
the total purchase price was approximately million  which included a cash payment of million and  shares of our common stock 
the purchase agreement also provides for additional contingent payments based on achieving revenue and profitability milestones 
no such contingent payments accrued in the transaction has been be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements of carescience  inc in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s agreements for its internet based tools  which typically cover an initial period of one to five years and are fixed priced  provide to customers  among other things  a software license  project management services  data management services  data storage and computer server maintenance and software support and maintenance 
revenues under these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period regardless of the timing of the required delivery of services to the customer or the related cost to the company of delivering such services 
the company s development agreements  with periods ranging from one to five years  provide for customer funding for the development of new solutions and services 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  the company is treating revenue on these agreements as a single element contract and is recognizing total revenue on a cost to cost basis over the entire agreement period 
the company s various consulting services are delivered either as a single program or as a project whose completion normally occurs over a several month period 
consulting revenues from program services are recorded as the program is completed 
consulting revenues from projects are recorded on a percentage of completion basis over the term of the project 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized from our development and consulting services agreements in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
legal contingencies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k  we are currently a defendant in a purported class action litigation 
the actions seek compensatory and other damages  and costs and expenses associated with litigation 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the case or estimate the range of any potential loss that may be incurred in the litigation  we believe the lawsuits are frivolous and without merit  strenuously deny all allegations of wrongdoing asserted by plaintiffs  and believe the company has meritorious defenses to plaintiffs claims 
we intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits and do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or future operating results 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to this proceeding 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent increases of from to and from to the increase was primarily related to revenues generated from performance under newly signed customer and development contracts as well as the additional revenues generated related to the acquisition of strategic outcomes services  inc in we anticipate that our revenue will continue to grow 
the ultimate growth of our revenue is dependent upon the timing of the signing of contracts and the introduction of new services 
unrecognized revenues related to customer contracts backlog as of december  totaled million  of which we expect to recognize million in in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
cost of revenues cost of revenues were million excluding stock based compensation of  million excluding stock based compensation of  and million excluding stock based compensation of  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an increase of from to and from to the increase was primarily a result of additional costs necessary to service new customers and development contracts 
gross profit our gross profit margin increased to in from in  as compared to in this increase in gross profit margin from to is primarily due to increased revenues spread over a partially fixed cost base 
the decrease in gross profit margin from to is primarily related to increased costs to service anticipated customer growth 
we do not expect significant changes in gross profit margin for the foreseeable future 
research and development research and development costs were million excluding stock based compensation of  million excluding stock based compensation of  and million excluding stock based compensation of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent a decrease of from to and an increase of from to this decrease from to is due primarily to lowering costs as certain development projects near completion 
the increase from to is primarily due to additional research and development costs supporting new development projects 
we do not expect significant changes in research and development costs in the foreseeable future 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development costs were  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
we expect the growth in revenue to exceed the growth in research and development costs 
therefore  we expect these costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million excluding stock based compensation of  million excluding stock based compensation of  and million excluding stock based compensation of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an increase of from to and from to this increase from to and to was primarily related to additional personnel  marketing and technical infrastructure expenditures 
we do not expect significant changes in selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative cost was  and in  and  respectively 
we expect the percentage of selling  general and administrative costs to decrease as a percentage of revenues in the future as our fixed costs are spread over an increasing revenue base 
stock based compensation during we granted certain stock options to our officers and employees with exercise prices deemed to be below the fair value of the underlying stock 
the cumulative difference between the fair value of the underlying stock at the date the options were granted and the exercise price of the granted options was million 
we are amortizing this amount over the four to seven year vesting periods of the granted options 
accordingly  our results from operations will include stock based compensation expense at least through we recognized million  million and  of stock based compensation expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income and expense net interest income was  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this amount arose primarily from investment interest income offset by interest expense from capital lease obligations 
the increase in net interest income in from is due to higher investable cash balances resulting from the cash received from our initial public offering on june  the decrease in net interest income in from is due to lower investable cash balances as a result of cash being used to fund operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations and funded our capital expenditures through the public and private sale of equity securities  supplemented by private debt and equipment leases 
we believe that available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements through at least as of december   we had million in cash and investment balances and working capital of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for those periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily to fund losses from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of and proceeds from available for sale securities  purchases of property and equipment  and acquisition purchase costs 
net cash from financing activities was a use of  an increase of million and a use of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in and consisted primarily of payments on capital lease obligations 
the net cash from financing activities in consisted primarily of the proceeds of the initial public offering net of the payment of dividends and redemption of preferred stock 
in the normal course of business  the company has entered into obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt  lease and license agreements as summarized in the table below payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations     software licensing agreements    operating leases     total      proceeds from long term debt financing were received in  and accordingly  are not included as a liability in the balance sheet as of december  for additional information see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as we execute our strategy  we expect operating expenses to continue at historic levels in order to fund development of current and new service lines 
presently  we anticipate that our existing capital resources will meet our operating and investing needs through at least after that time  additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  execute our operating plans or acquire complementary businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure additional lines of credit  which may result in ownership dilution to our shareholders

upon adoption of the new standard  goodwill  including goodwill associated with equity method investments  will no longer be amortized 
for the year ended december   goodwill amortization was  in addition  goodwill  other than goodwill associated with equity method investments  must be assessed at least annually for impairment using a fair value based approach 
the provisions of this statement are required to be adopted as of the beginning of the first fiscal year after december  impairment losses that arise due to the initial application of this statement are to be reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

the impact of adopting this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors we are subject to a high degree of risk 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business our business is difficult to evaluate because we operate in a new industry and our operating history is limited 
because of our limited operating history it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we launched our first internet based solution in our business presents the difficulties and expenses frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development  coupled with the risks and uncertainties faced by companies in new and evolving markets such as the market for internet based software applications 
we may not be able to successfully address these challenges 
if we fail to do so  we may continue to incur losses and the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
we have a history of losses and expect our losses to continue 
we have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities from our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur net operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we will incur direct expenses associated with the further development and marketing of our existing services and with new product development 
our success depends on our ability to increase revenues to offset expenses 
we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these expenses or to achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the proprietary technology we own or license may be subjected to infringement claims or disagreements with the licensor which could be costly to resolve 
the intellectual property we own or license is important to our business 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and divert our attention from operating our business 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  we may not be able to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we have no patents  but instead license important technology from the university of pennsylvania and the california healthcare foundation 
consequently  infringement claims against the university or the foundation or disagreements between the university or the foundation and us pertaining to our licensed technology could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights or the rights we have licensed from the university or the foundation 
we may not detect this unauthorized use  and we may be unable to enforce our rights 
we depend on an exclusive license with the university of pennsylvania and an exclusive license with the california healthcare foundation for some of our technology  and the loss of these licenses would impair our ability to develop our business 
our ability to use our technology and compete effectively in our industry would be impaired if our exclusive license agreements with the university of pennsylvania or the california healthcare foundation were terminated 
under these license agreements  we are required to make royalty payments to the university and the foundation  respectively  based on a percentage of the fees we earn through the sublicensing and servicing of the technology and information received from the university or the foundation  as applicable  under the relevant license agreement 
in order to maintain the exclusivity of our license with the university  we are required to pay a minimum of  per year in royalties 
in order to maintain exclusivity of our license with the foundation  we are required to pay a minimum level of    and  per year in royalties for the year   and and each year after  respectively 
if we do not make these minimum royalty payments  the university and the foundation  respectively  may terminate the exclusive status of our license under the respective agreement  and  in effect  license the technology to our competitors 
in addition  under the license agreement with the university  the university retains the right  after consultation and negotiation with us  to publish a description of the technology without our consent  whether or not any intellectual property protection on this technology has been filed 
if the university or the foundation were to license the technology to our competitors or the university were to publish the technology  our revenues may decrease significantly and we may not be able to develop or maintain customer and strategic relationships 
in addition  if we pay the university less than  in royalties  the university may terminate our license entirely 
in the event that the university or the foundation chose not to license the technology to us at all  we may not be able to develop similar alternative technology or negotiate a new license agreement with another licensor 
if we were not able to develop alternative technology or acquire a new license  we may not be able to maintain our business operations 
we could be liable for information retrieved from our web sites and incur significant costs from resulting claims 
we may be subject to third party claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the information we supply to our customers through our internet based applications 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services in the past 
we could be subject to liability with respect to content that may be accessible through our web site or third party web sites linked from our web site 
for example  claims could be made against us if a customer relies on health care information accessed through our web site to their detriment 
even if claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them and in implementing measures to reduce our exposure to any possible liability 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
we may experience system failures which could interrupt our service and damage our customer relationships 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and may in the future 
our experience has been that interruptions in any month are seldom more than a few hours 
however  any significant interruption in our services or degradation in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing customers or strategic partners and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services to customers and partners 
although we maintain insurance for our business  it may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or to reimburse costs associated with business interruptions 
we currently operate our application service provider system and components in a single service location 
the health care industry may not accept our solutions or buy our solutions and services which would adversely affect our financial results 
we must attract a significant number of customers throughout the health care industry or our financial results will be adversely affected 
to date  the health care industry has been resistant to adopting new information technology solutions 
we believe that complexities in the nature of health care data that we process and analyze have hindered the development and acceptance of information technology solutions by the industry 
conversion from traditional methods to electronic information exchange may not occur as rapidly as we anticipate 
even if the conversion does occur as rapidly as we expect  health care industry participants may use applications and services offered by others 
we believe that we must gain significant market share with our applications and services before our competitors introduce alternative solutions  applications or services with features similar to our current or proposed offerings 
our business plan is based on our belief that the value and market appeal of our solution will grow as the number of participants and the scope of services available on our platform increases 
in addition  we expect to generate a significant portion of our revenue from subscription and transaction based fees based on patient admissions and encounters 
consequently  any significant shortfall in the number of subscribers or transactions occurring over our platform would adversely affect our financial results 
our quarterly financial results may fluctuate significantly  which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
we expect quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future 
these fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline 
these fluctuations may result from a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control 
these factors include expansion or contraction of our customer base  the amount and timing of costs related to development and marketing efforts or other initiatives  the timing of our introduction of new solutions and services and the market acceptance of those solutions and services  the timing of contracts with strategic partners and other parties  the level of acceptance of the internet by the health care industry  and technical difficulties  system downtime  undetected software errors and other problems affecting our solutions or the internet generally 
in order to implement our business plans  we may increase activities and spending in our operational areas 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have lower revenue  we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response 
these factors may prevent us from meeting the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors and our stock price could suffer 
because our revenues are dependent on a limited number of service lines  the failure of any one of these service lines would significantly decrease our revenues 
we currently derive our revenue from our care management system  care data exchange and lifecycle decision system internet based applications 
because our revenues are dependent on only a few service lines  the failure of any one of them to achieve market acceptance would significantly decrease our revenue 
as our customers needs change  our existing suite of applications may become inefficient or obsolete and will likely require modifications or improvements 
the addition of new solutions or services will also require us to continually improve the technology underlying our applications 
these requirements could be significant  and we may be unable to meet them or may incur unanticipated product development expenses or delays 
if we fail to respond quickly and efficiently to our customers needs  or if our new applications and service offerings do not achieve market acceptance  the market for our services would likely decline 
our business will suffer if we do not expand the breadth of our applications quickly 
we currently offer a limited number of applications on our platform and our future success depends on quickly introducing new applications to expand the utility of our solutions and services to our existing customer base and generate new customers 
each of our applications must integrate with our computer systems and platform 
developing these applications will be expensive and time consuming 
even if we are successful  these applications may never achieve market acceptance 
termination of one or more of our significant contracts would cause a significant decline in our revenue 
we currently generate much of our revenue from a limited number of contractual relationships 
during the years ended december   and  we generated  and of our revenue from our development partner  california healthcare foundation 
during the year ended december   we generated of our revenue from our largest customer  providence health system 
termination of either of these contractual relationships would significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these entities may terminate their contracts for cause or upon expiration of their agreements in and  respectively 
failure to manage our growth would adversely affect our operations 
our growth has placed significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our administrative  technical and financial personnel and systems 
we expect future growth which may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
our systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not adequately support expansion of our operations 
our future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
failure to respond to and manage changing business conditions and continued growth could materially and adversely affect the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our results of operations 
we face intense competition and may be unable to compete successfully which would adversely effect our financial results 
the market for internet services is relatively new  intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
since the internet s commercialization in the early s  the number of web sites on the internet competing for users attention has proliferated with no substantial barriers to entry  and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
any pricing pressures  reduced margins or loss of market share resulting from our failure to compete effectively would materially and adversely affect our financial results 
we expect competition in our markets to increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines and services 
many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater resources that can be devoted to the development  promotion and sale of their services  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition  and larger customer bases 
the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of david j 
brailer  our chief executive officer  ronald a 
paulus  our president  or one or more of our other executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  customer service and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified employees in the future 
failure to hire and retain personnel in key positions could materially and adversely affect our operations and  consequently  our financial results 
our failure to develop strategic relationships could adversely affect our ability to develop new services 
if we fail to form new strategic alliances with industry partners  fail to maintain existing alliances or if we form alliances with partners who do not perform well  we will have difficulty gaining acceptance of our services 
our development of new and expanded applications for our services will be enhanced by forming strategic alliances with industry partners 
while we believe that we will form these alliances  we have not yet negotiated many of these strategic alliances and there is no guarantee that we can consummate these alliances on commercially reasonable terms 
to be successful  we must establish and maintain strategic relationships with leaders in a number of health care industry segments 
strategic relationships are critical to our success because we believe that these relationships will enable us to extend the reach of our applications and services to the various participants in the health care industry  obtain specialized health care expertise  develop and deploy new applications  further enhance carescience brands  and generate revenue 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our future partners may decide to compete with us 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in the health care industry if we have established relationships with competitors of these key participants 
consequently  it is important that our customers and partners perceive us as independent of any particular customer or partner 
any substantial relationship which we have  or develop  with a partner or customer could adversely impact that perception of independence and make it difficult to enter into strategic relationships or sell our solutions and services to other customers 
most of our revenue is generated by a small number of significant contracts  which could affect the perception of our independence  however  we have not experienced any difficulties in forming strategic relationships in the past for this reason 
moreover  many potential partners may resist working with us until we have successfully introduced our applications and services and our applications and services have achieved market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners abilities to generate increased acceptance and use of our platform  applications and services 
we have limited experience in establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with health care industry participants 
if  in the future  we lose any strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic partners fail to actively pursue additional business relationships and partnerships  we would not be able to execute our business plans and our business would suffer significantly 
we may not experience increased use of our platform  applications and services even if we establish and maintain these strategic relationships 
our failure to use new technologies effectively or to adapt emerging industry standards would adversely affect our ability to compete 
to be competitive  we must license leading technologies  enhance our existing services and content  develop new technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of health care professionals and consumers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our internet based applications and proprietary or licensed technology to user requirements or emerging industry standards  because those new technologies may not easily integrate with our existing platform 
in addition  we may be unable to implement or adapt new technologies in a cost effective manner 
our failure to adapt our technology to our customers needs or to handle high levels of customer activity would adversely affect our ability to increase revenue 
our ability to increase revenue in the future will be adversely affected if our technology is not able to handle high levels of customer activity on our web site or if our technology fails to meet our customers performance standards 
so far  we have processed a limited number and variety of transactions using our technology 
similarly  a limited number of health care participants use our solutions and services 
we anticipate substantial increased demands on our system as our business and applications expand 
our systems may not accommodate increased use while maintaining acceptable performance 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing customer requirements 
this expansion and adaptation will be expensive and may divert our attention from other activities 
our user agreements with our customers generally contain only limited performance standards 
however  our customers do have performance expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations  our customers could become dissatisfied and terminate their agreements with us 
the loss of some of our user agreements could significantly impact our financial results 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing needs on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
failure by our service providers could interrupt our business and damage our customer relationships 
our service providers enable us to connect to the internet 
any problems with these or other services that result in interruptions of our services or a failure of our services to function as desired could cause customer complaints and attrition and could materially and adversely affect our operations 
we may have no means of replacing these services or  in the case of services which we are obligated to use exclusively  we may be prohibited from replacing these services  on a timely basis or at all  if those services are inadequate or in the event of a service interruption or failure 
to operate without interruption  our service and content providers must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
interruptions may occur and any material interruptions could adversely impact our operations and our relationship with our customers 
we may need to obtain additional capital and failure to do so may limit our growth 
we expect that the available cash and investment balances at december  will be sufficient to meet our requirements through at least however  we may need to raise additional financing to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
failure to raise additional capital  if needed  will adversely effect our operations and stock price 
at the time we need additional financing  the state of our operations or market conditions generally may not be favorable  and we may be unable to raise any additional amounts on reasonable terms  if at all  when they are needed 
we may need to raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
in addition  if we sell additional equity securities  your percentage ownership in us will decrease 
if we sell debt securities  the interest payments we would have to make to the holders of those securities would reduce our earnings 
our officers  directors and affiliated entities have significant control over us and their interests may differ from yours 
our directors and management beneficially own or control approximately of our common stock 
if these people act together  they will be able to significantly influence our management  affairs and all matters requiring shareholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition of us and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
risks related to our industry health information is subject to potential government regulation and legal uncertainties and changes may require us to alter our business 
our business is subject to potential government regulation 
existing as well as new laws and regulations could affect how we do business and materially and adversely affect our financial results 
there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the internet 
however  laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of solutions and services 
internet user privacy has become an issue both in the united states and abroad 
current united states privacy law consists of a few disparate statutes directed at specific industries that collect personal data  none of which specifically covers the collection of personal information online 
the united states or foreign nations may adopt legislation purporting to protect the privacy of personal information 
any privacy legislation could affect the way in which we are allowed to conduct our business  especially those aspects that involve the collection or use of personal information  and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel  negligence and personal privacy are applicable to the internet 
currently  our operations are not regulated by any health care agency 
however  with regard to the electronic storage  transmission and communication of health care information over the internet  the health insurance portability and accountability act of directed the us department of health and human services to develop and require the use of standards for electronic transactions  unique identifiers  data security  privacy of individually identifiable health information and other provisions 
regulations implementing these standards are in various phases of development 
the final regulation setting standards for electronic transactions and code sets was promulgated on august  as discussed above  the final regulation setting privacy standards for protected health information was promulgated on december  and was effective on april  the other regulations required by the health insurance portability and accountability act of have not yet been promulgated as final rules 
it will be necessary for our technology platform and for the applications that we provide to be in compliance with the final privacy regulation by april  these regulations define specified information about an individual as protected health information and set forth the steps that persons storing or transmitting the information must take to ensure its confidentiality 
our internal procedures and policies for handling of confidential information  as well as our contractual relationships with others with whom we share information  will also have to comply with these regulations 
we do not expect to significantly modify our services or business operations or materially increase our expenses in response to current regulations 
however  the health insurance portability and accountability act of does not prevent states from implementing more stringent rules or regulations 
furthermore  several telecommunications carriers are seeking to have telecommunications over the internet regulated by the federal communications commission in the same manner as other telecommunications services 
because the growing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure in many areas  local exchange carriers have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on the internet service providers and online service providers 
changes in the health care industry could adversely affect our operations 
the health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of health care organizations 
changes in current health care financing and reimbursement systems could cause us to make unplanned changes to our applications or services  or result in delays or cancellations of orders or in the revocation of endorsement of our applications and services by health care participants 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the united states health care system at both the federal and state level 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in health care  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which health care industry participants operate 
health care industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our applications and services 
our business will suffer if commercial users do not accept internet solutions 
our business model depends on the adoption of internet solutions by commercial users 
our business could suffer dramatically if internet solutions are not accepted or not perceived to be effective 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace 
we expect internet use to grow in number of users and volume of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this continued growth 
our industry is evolving and we may not adapt successfully 
the new and rapidly evolving internet market may cause us to incur substantial costs in responding to changes in that market or  if we fail to respond to such changes  cause our revenues to decline as our customers switch to newer  better technology 
advances in software technology occur frequently  and we may not respond rapidly enough to the introduction of better software to maintain our customer base in the future 
we will not be successful in the internet market  unless  among other things  we increase awareness of our carescience brands and continue to develop customer loyalty  provide useful health care analysis services to subscribers at attractive prices  respond to competitive and technological developments  and build an operations structure to support our business 
risks relating to our common stock our common stock price may be volatile 
our stock price has declined since our initial public offering due to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations  announcements relating to strategic relationships  customer relationship developments  and conditions affecting the internet or health care industries  in general 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for technology and internet related companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
on october   several purported class action securities claims were filed against us 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the case or estimate the range of any potential loss that may be incurred in the litigation  we believe the lawsuits are frivolous and without merit  strenuously deny all allegations of wrongdoing asserted by plaintiffs  and believe we have meritorious defenses to plaintiffs claims 
see item legal proceedings 
if other suits are filed against us  that litigation could be expensive and would divert management s attention 
future sales of shares could adversely affect our stock price 
the market price for our common stock could fall dramatically if our shareholders sell large amounts of our common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash equivalents  short term investments and capital lease obligations are at fixed interest rates and therefore the fair market value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december  we had the ability to immediately liquidate all of our investments 
therefore  we believe that we are exposed to immaterial levels of market risk
