the effective income tax rate in was higher primarily because the company recognized no tax benefit associated with its impairment charge of day designs  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements

provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was during and seasonality historically  due to the timing of wholesale trade shows early in the calendar year  the company has received the majority of its total annual wholesale customer orders during the first quarter of each year 
the company entered and of its total net annual wholesale customer orders during and  respectively  during the first quarter of each of those years 
cancellations of total annual wholesale customer orders were approximately and in and  respectively 
orders not shipped in a particular year  net of cancellations  are carried into backlog for the following year and have historically been orders for spring and easter products 
the company s backlog of wholesale customer orders was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company receives products  pays its suppliers and ships products throughout the year  although historically the majority of wholesale shipments occur in the second and third quarters as retailers stock merchandise in anticipation of the holiday season 
as a result of this seasonal pattern  the company generally records its highest wholesale sales during the second and third quarters of each year 
however  the company can experience fluctuations in quarterly wholesale sales and related net income compared with the prior year due to the timing of receipt of product from suppliers and subsequent shipment of product from the company to wholesale customers  as well as the timing of orders placed by wholesale customers 
in addition  the company recognizes the majority of its retail sales in the fourth quarter during the peak holiday shopping season 
the company is not managed to maximize quarter to quarter results  but rather to achieve annual objectives designed to achieve long term growth consistent with the company s business strategy

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  from million in to million in principally due to the decrease in net sales which resulted in a decrease in net income in and higher cash collections in as a result of the higher than normal accounts receivable balances at the end of this decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash due to lower inventory and higher payable balances in consistent with customary practice in the giftware industry  the company offers extended accounts receivable terms to many of its wholesale customers 
this practice has typically created significant working capital requirements in the second and third quarters for which the company has generally financed with internally generated cash flow and seasonal borrowings 
the company s cash and cash equivalents balances peak during the first quarter of the subsequent year  following the collection of accounts receivable with extended payment terms due in november and december 
accounts receivable  net of reserves  which principally consists of wholesale trade receivables  decreased by  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in accounts receivable was principally due to a decrease in wholesale sales from to and improved cash collections 
management believes there is adequate provision for any doubtful accounts receivable and product claims that may arise 
inventories decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in inventories was principally due to additional write downs related to excess inventories and the company s initiative to reduce inventory levels through better inventory planning and more efficient product flow through the company s distribution center 
the decrease in inventory was partially offset by million of additional inventory on hand at the end of as a result of the geppeddo acquisition 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in and included million and million  respectively  for information systems principally related to the company s implementation of its integrated computer systems

during the third quarter of  the company completed its million acquisition of geppeddo  a privately held designer  importer and specialty retailer based in salt lake city whose products  primarily porcelain dolls  doll accessories and plush items  are marketed under the brand name geppeddo 
the geppeddo business operates customized kiosks located in approximately major malls and shopping centers throughout the united states and canada during the peak holiday shopping season 
the acquisition gives the company additional differentiated and branded products  and access to a new channel of distribution 
the high quality and creativity of geppeddo s products and strength of the geppeddo brand complement the reputation of department for quality  branded product lines 
the company sees the potential to expand upon this brand and distribution channel with new concepts designed to enhance and lengthen the selling season of the acquired business 
the founders and entire management team of the acquired business are continuing in their positions 
revenue generated by geppeddo in was approximately million since the acquisition date 
the selling shareholders of the acquired business have the ability to earn up to an additional million of cash consideration if certain pre specified financial performance measures are attained as measured annually over a three year period concluding february  during january  the company completed a million strategic minority investment in day designs  inc  a manufacturer and marketer of high quality accent furniture and wooden accessories sold primarily through furniture  home furnishings  and catalog retailers principally in the united states 
the transaction was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
during the quarter ended september   the company recognized a million impairment of the company s minority investment in day designs  inc given continued deterioration in the us home furnishings market 
the impairment charge recorded reduced the carrying value of the company s minority investment to zero 
the company has not guaranteed any debt obligations of day designs  inc during  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of the independent sales representative organizations that represented the company s products in massachusetts and several other eastern states  minnesota and several other midwestern states  and texas and several surrounding southern states 
the cost of these acquisitions was million 
in april  the company executed a lease for a new distribution center in minnesota 
the lease provides for a year term  with options to renew the lease  as well as to expand and or acquire the facility 
during  the company consolidated its two existing distribution centers and storage facility into the new distribution center 
estimated costs of million were recorded in related to noncancelable lease contracts associated with the existing rented facilities 
in  the company repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
no shares were repurchased in since january  the company has repurchased a total of million shares 
the company had no remaining authorization from the board of directors to repurchase any additional shares at the end of the company s credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million including letters of credit 
the letters of credit are issued primarily in connection with inventory purchases 
the credit agreement contains numerous financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on incurring indebtedness and liens  selling property and paying dividends 
in addition  the company is required to satisfy consolidated net worth  interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio tests  in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter 
none of these restrictions are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate in the future 
during the first quarter of  the company borrowed an additional million of term debt under its term loan facility which brought the total outstanding term debt to million as of april  during the second quarter of  the company prepaid million of term debt which cannot be reborrowed and included the million payment due march during the first quarter of  the company prepaid million of term debt under its term loan facility 
as of december   the total term debt outstanding was million 
the company s remaining term debt requires annual amortization payments of million  million  and due march   and  respectively 
the company s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december  was million and will fluctuate during based on accounts receivable and inventory levels 
the company believes that its internally generated cash flow and seasonal borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund operations and capital expenditures for the next months 
credit  return and other critical accounting policies the company has credit policies that establish specific criteria related to creditworthiness that its customers must meet prior to the shipment of product to the customer 
the company periodically makes limited and selective exceptions to its policy of not shipping to customers with overdue balances when the particular customer has met specific criteria which are indicative of a wherewithal to pay their past due and future balances 
the company does not accept returns from wholesale customers without its prior authorization 
returns are typically accepted only for damaged or defective goods  or for pricing or shipping discrepancies 
the company reserves the right to refuse authorization of any returns and to discard any unauthorized returns 
if the company accepts an unauthorized return or if a return is the result of a customer error  the wholesale customer may be subject to a handling charge 
the company reserves the right to cancel open orders or backorders for those wholesale customers who abuse or excessively use return privileges 
the company believes that the selection and application of its accounting policies are appropriately reasoned 
the following are the accounting policies that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
sales returns an allowance is established for expenses and losses related to possible returns of product 
the amount of the allowances is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return  and other factors 
changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
inventory valuation inventory is written down for estimated surplus and discontinued inventory items 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined by reviewing customer accounts and making estimates of amounts that may be uncollectible 
factors considered in determining the amount of the reserve include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  general business  economic and political conditions  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item

see discussion in legal proceedings under item recent accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board fasb approved for issuance statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
major provisions of these statements are as follows all business combinations initiated after june  must use the purchase method of accounting  the pooling of interest method of accounting is prohibited except for transactions initiated before july   intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recorded separately from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the acquired entity and can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or as part of a related contract  asset or liability  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually  except in certain circumstances  and whenever there is an impairment indicator  all acquired goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing and segment reporting 
in general  impairment testing will entail a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill 
these statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   at which time goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization 
as of december   the company had net goodwill of million 
goodwill amortization expense recorded during fiscal year was million 
based on a preliminary review of the new standard  management believes the company will record a goodwill impairment charge upon adoption  and that the amount of such charge will likely be significant in relation to the company s unamortized goodwill balance 
however  the company has not completed its evaluation to determine the exact amount of such a charge 
such impairment charge will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and therefore will not affect operating income 
also  the company believes this charge will not meaningfully affect the financial covenant calculations under the company s credit agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of new accounting standards 
foreign exchange approximately of the company s sales in were denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  were not subject to changes in exchange rates 
approximately of the company s sales were denominated in foreign currencies which were subject to changes in exchange rates 
the company imports its product from manufacturers located in the pacific rim  principally china 
although the company generally pays for its product in united states dollars  the cost of such product may fluctuate with the value of the chinese currency because the purchase price paid to the company s vendors in united states dollars would be worth more or less in the chinese currency 
as a result  the company s costs could be adversely affected if the chinese currency appreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
conversely  its costs would be favorably affected if the chinese currency depreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
in addition  the company purchased less than of its product from taiwan republic of china in these purchases were denominated in new taiwan dollars and were subject to changes in exchange rates 
the company  from time to time  will enter into foreign exchange contracts or build foreign currency deposits as a partial hedge against currency fluctuations 
the company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts nor have any foreign exchange contracts outstanding in fiscal and effect of inflation the company continually attempts to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling its operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
factors affecting future earnings on february   the company issued a press release stating in relevant part the company intends to provide an outlook for fiscal in conjunction with its release of first quarter financial results in april 
information on its wholesale orders received during the first quarter of will also be disclosed at that time 
for the last several years the company has released wholesale order information in february in conjunction with its reporting of prior year results 
however  as described below  the company has implemented certain customer ordering programs that management believes will materially change the timing of customer orders 
as a result  the comparability of customer orders to prior year levels through mid february does not provide a sufficiently accurate guideline for the company to provide investors with an outlook for at this time 
the press release further stated during the company performed extensive research within its core customer base of gift and collectible stores 
in response to this feedback  the company has designed and implemented new ordering  sales  marketing and operational programs designed to improve the quality of service to its customers 
one of the significant objectives of these programs is to guarantee customers a specific time frame for delivery of product based upon the month in which the customer orders 
these programs will alter the timing of customer orders within the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  throughout the year 
over the past two years  the company s principal customers have decreased by approximately  or 
similarly  customers who sell the company s village series and or snowbabies products have decreased by approximately  or 
the company believes the decrease in customers and related decrease in sales is due to several factors including the problems experienced during the implementation of the company s enterprise wide computer system  and an overall weakness in the economy which has forced some of the company s customers to go out of business 
the company has enacted programs to curb the decline in customers and wholesale sales experienced over the past two years including implementing new customer ordering and shipping programs 
the company is also strengthening its sales management team  working to refine its product development process  improving the gift and decorating appeal of its product  and broadening the seasonal coverage of its product lines to drive sales growth 
the federal securities laws provide safe harbor status to certain statements that go beyond historical information and may provide an indication of future results 
any conclusions or expectations expressed in  or drawn from  the statements in the press release or throughout this annual report concerning matters that are not historical corporate financial results are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s sales  gross margin  earnings and earnings per share can be significantly impacted by many factors including consumer acceptance of new products  product development efforts  identification and retention of sculpting and other talent  shift in product mix  completion of third party product manufacturing  retailer reorders and order cancellations  the volume  number  mix and timing of retailers orders  retailer inventory policies  and the company s ability to forecast and fulfill changes in anticipated product demand  control of operating expenses  collection of accounts receivable  changes in freight rates  changes in foreign exchange rates  corporate cash flow application  including share repurchases  cost of debt capital  functionality of information  operating and distribution systems  identification  completion and results of acquisitions  investments  and other strategic business initiatives  capital expenditures and depreciation  and the timing thereof  grants of stock options or other equity equivalents  actual or deemed exercises of stock options  industry  general economic  regulatory  transportation  and international trade and monetary conditions  and actions of competitors 
actual results may vary materially from forward looking statements and the assumptions on which they are based 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or publish in the future any forward looking statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the first component of the company s interest rate risk relates to its debt outstanding 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates 
because this facility carries a variable interest rate  the company s results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on december  borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million 
the second component of the company s interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash 
excess cash flow is typically invested in high quality fixed income securities issued by banks  corporations and the us government  municipal securities  and overnight repurchase agreements backed by us government securities 
these securities are classified as cash equivalents on the company s balance sheet 
at december   the company s cash balance was approximately million 
earnings from cash equivalents were approximately million for the fifty two weeks ended december  based on the december  cash balance  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately million 
approximately of the company s sales and less than of the company s product purchases in fiscal year were denominated in a foreign currency 
based on these sales and product purchases  a increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates would have an impact of less than million
