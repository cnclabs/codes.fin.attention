the company  a delaware corporation  was formed as a result of the merger  by and among the company  brhz and cfam  which was approved by the shareholders of brhz and cfam on july  in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests and structured as a tax free reorganization 
in  the company began operating in europe through the acquisitions of nurseryworks limited  based in london  england which operates nine child care centers in the greater london area  and circle of friends  based in ireland  which operates two childcare centers 
in  the company commenced operations in canada upon the opening of a child care and early education center in the toronto  canada area 
the operations of the company s non domestic child care centers are not material to the company s operating results  financial position or cash flows 
center economics 
the company s revenue is principally derived from the operation of child care and early education centers  and to a lesser extent  other services including consulting services 
child care and early education center revenues consist of parent fees for tuition  amounts paid by sponsors to subsidize parent fees  and management fees paid by client sponsors 
revenue growth has primarily resulted from the addition of new child care and early education centers  as well as increased enrollment and tuition  and expanded programs at existing centers 
parent fees comprise the largest component of a center s revenue and are billed on a monthly or weekly basis  payable in advance 
the parent fees are generally comparable to or slightly higher than prevailing area market rates for tuition 
amounts paid by sponsor clients are payable monthly and may be dependent on a number of factors such as enrollment  the extent to which the sponsor wishes to subsidize parent fees  the quality enhancements a sponsor wishes to make in the operations of the center  and budgeted amounts 
management fees are generally fixed and payable monthly 
although the specifics of the company s sponsorship arrangements vary widely  there are two basic forms  the sponsor model and the management model 
the company employs the sponsor model in approximately of its child care and early education center sites 
under the sponsor model  a child care and early education center is operated at or near the sponsor s work site 
the company retains profit and loss responsibility for the operation of the center  and  as part of the arrangement  may receive financial support from the sponsor 
sponsor support can take various forms  including reduced occupancy costs  tuition assistance and start up and or operating cost assistance 
newly opened sponsored centers generally operate at a loss until utilization levels reach approximately which typically occurs within to months of operation 
in exchange for client sponsorship  the company gives priority enrollment to the children of employees or tenants affiliated with the sponsor 
in centers operating under the sponsor model  the company may be required to make capital expenditures necessary to initially fit out  equip and furnish the child care and early education centers  as well as make similar expenditures to refurbish and maintain existing centers 
while sponsors generally provide for the space or construction of the child care and early education center  the company may pay for leasehold improvements or construction costs 
the company may make capital investments when it is able to obtain favorable purchase terms or when a sponsor agrees to pay fees in advance for long term priority enrollment rights in the center  or for other guarantees 
under the management model  which comprises approximately of the company s operating sites  the company operates a child care and early education center under a cost plus agreement 
these contracts generally include a management fee and require that the client provide an operating subsidy to supplement parent fees or tuition within an agreed upon budget 
the operating subsidies are dependent on the tuition levels the sponsor chooses to set for its employees and the cost structure associated with operating the center  including program enhancements the sponsor wishes to make 
due to the financial commitment of the client  the company does not sustain pre opening or initial operating losses under the management model 
to the extent that the costs of operating the center vary from planned levels  the operating subsidies paid by client sponsors will also vary  however  the company generally earns a fixed return in management model centers which is unaffected by the variations in operating subsidy 
at mature operating levels the management model centers generally experience slightly lower operating margins than the sponsor model centers 
in centers operating under the management model  the sponsor typically provides for all costs associated with building  fitting out  equipping  furnishing and supplying the child care and early education center 
the sponsor is also typically responsible for ongoing occupancy and maintenance costs 
under the sponsor model  the tuition paid by parents is supplemented in some cases by direct payments from sponsors and  to a far lesser extent  direct payment from government agencies 
under the management model  in addition to parent tuition  revenue also includes management fees and operating subsidies 
tuition  management fees and fees for priority enrollment rights paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned 
in addition to the sponsor and management models  the company may establish a center in instances where it has been unable to cultivate sponsorship  or sponsorship opportunities do not currently exist 
in these instances the company will typically lease space in locations where experience and demographics indicate that demand for the company s services exist 
these centers typically operate at a loss until utilization levels reach approximately  which typically occurs within to months of operation 
cost of services expenses consist of direct expenses associated with the operation of child care and early education centers and with the delivery of consulting services 
cost of services consist primarily of staff salaries  taxes and benefits  food costs  program supplies and materials  parent marketing  and occupancy costs 
personnel costs are the largest component of a center s operating costs  and comprise approximately of a center s operating expenses 
however  personnel costs will be proportionately larger in child care and early education centers operating under the management model and proportionally lower in child care and early education centers operating under the sponsor model 
consulting cost of services are composed primarily of staff salaries  taxes and benefits  contract labor  and other direct operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are composed primarily of salaries  taxes and benefits for non center personnel  including corporate  regional and business development personnel  accounting and legal fees  information technology  occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel and other general corporate expenses 
amortization expense is being recognized over the period benefited by certain intangible assets  which include goodwill  non compete agreements and contract rights associated with acquisitions made by the company 
new centers 
in  the company added new child care and early education centers  of which are operating under the sponsor model and of which are operating under the management model 
in the same period  the company closed centers that were either not meeting operating objectives or transitioned to other service providers 
the company currently has over centers under development  scheduled to open over the next to months 
the opening of new centers is subject to a number of conditions and factors  including  among others  construction timing  sponsor needs and weather conditions 
seasonality 
the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
demand for child care and early education services has historically decreased during the summer months 
during this season  families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements 
demand for the company s services generally increases in september upon the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year 
results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the performance of existing centers including enrollment and staffing fluctuations  the number and timing of new center openings and or acquisitions  the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability  center closings  refurbishment or relocation  the model mix sponsor vs 
management of new and existing centers  the timing and level of sponsorship payments  competitive factors and general economic conditions

in and the company made equity investments in two privately held companies associated with the child care and early education industry 
in the quarter ended december   the company was notified that one of the entities  which developed internet based educational and entertainment content for children and families  was discontinuing further program and content development until additional funding could be secured 
the company was also notified in this period by the other entity in which the company held an equity investment that  due to contractions in business  additional funding would be necessary to continue its operations 
based on the outlook for additional funding for either of these companies  management assessed that the potential for future recovery of these investments was not likely 
as a result  the company recognized a charge of   after tax in connection with the impairment of these equity investments 
in february the internet based company filed for bankruptcy  and in april  the assets of the other company were liquidated and the company officially abandoned the stock 
net interest expense income 
net interest income in totaled  as compared to  in the decrease in net interest income is attributable to lower levels of invested cash and to borrowing under the line of credit 
income tax expense 
the company had an effective tax rate of in  and in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are from the ongoing operations of its existing child care and early education centers and the addition of new centers through development or acquisition 
the company s primary source of liquidity has been from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings available under the company s various credit arrangements 
the company had a working capital deficit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of an increase in net income before depreciation and amortization of million  as well as a smaller increase in accounts receivable in as compared to in addition  accounts payable and accrued expenses  due in large part to balances in accrued salary and benefits at year end  and workers compensation insurance  increased million compared to an increase of million in operating cash flow also increased as the result of million in deferred revenue in as compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in from was primarily the result of an in increase in net income before depreciation and amortization of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable in as compared to additionally  operating cash flow increased as the result of million in deferred revenue as compared to million of deferred revenue in  as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses

the decrease in was principally due to a reduction of cash paid out for acquisitions  which totaled million in compared to million in of the million of fixed asset additions in  approximately million relate to new child care and early education centers  of the remainder  approximately million relates to the refurbishment and expansion of existing child care and early education centers  with the balance expended for office expansion and investment in information technology in corporate  regional and district offices 
management expects to maintain  or increase slightly  the current level of center related fixed asset spending through cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in in  the company made net payments of million to its lines of credit and million in short term debt payments 
in the year ended december  cash used by financing activities was primarily the result of the company s repurchase of  shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
during the years  and  the company received  and million  respectively  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options 
in  the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to a total of  shares of the company s common stock 
at december  the company had repurchased  shares for a total of million  all of which was acquired in share repurchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time with the company s cash in accordance with applicable securities regulations in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the actual number of shares purchased and cash used  as well as the timing of purchases and the prices paid  will depend on future market conditions 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist primarily of high quality commercial paper and institutional money market accounts 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates market value due to their short maturities 
management believes that funds provided by operations and the company s existing cash and cash equivalent balances and borrowings available under its lines of credit will be adequate to meet planned operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
the company s existing million line of credit expires in june  which management expects to renew on similar terms 
however  if the company is unable to renew the facility  or were to make any significant acquisition s or investments in the purchase of facilities for new or existing child care and early education centers  it may be necessary for the company to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented 
the application of the company s accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and assumptions that pertain to future uncertainties and as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies we believe are critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangibles  liability for insurance obligations and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  which requires that four basic criteria be met before recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in both the sponsor model and the management model  revenues consist primarily of tuition paid by parents  supplemented in some cases by payments from sponsors and  to a lesser extent  by payments from government agencies 
revenues also include management fees paid by corporate sponsors 
in the management model  in addition to tuition and management fee revenues  revenue is also recognized for operating subsidies paid either in lieu of or to supplement tuition 
revenue is recognized as services are performed 
in some instances the company receives revenue in advance of services being rendered  which is deferred until the services have been provided 
accounts receivable 
the company generates accounts receivable from fees charged to parents and client sponsors  and to a lesser degree governmental agencies 
the company monitors collections and payments from these customers and maintains a provision for estimated losses based on historical trends  in addition to amounts established for specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
amounts charged to this provision for uncollectible accounts receivable have historically been within the company s expectations  but there can be no assurance that future experience will be consistent with the company s past experience 
goodwill and intangibles 
accounting for acquisitions requires management to make estimates related to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets  with any residual balance being allocated to goodwill 
accounting for intangible assets requires management to make assessments concerning the value of these intangible assets and whether events or circumstances indicate that these assets been impaired 
on january  the company will be required to adopt the provisions of have statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which  among other things  require the company to discontinue the amortization of goodwill as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in lieu of recording amortization of intangible assets the company will be required to complete an initial review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in  and annually thereafter 
should it be determined that any of these assets have been impaired  the company would be required to record an impairment charge 
the company does not expect to record an impairment charge in  however  there can be no assurance that such a charge will not be recorded in or in future periods 
liability for insurance obligations 
the company self insures a portion of its workers compensation and medical insurance plans 
due to the nature of these liabilities  which may not fully manifest themselves for several years  the company estimates the obligations for liabilities incurred but not yet reported or paid based on available data and experience 
while management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations is sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims and costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires management to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
due to differences in the recognition of items included in income for accounting and tax purposes for items such as deferred revenue  temporary differences arise which are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
the company estimates the likelihood of recovery of these assets  which is dependent on future levels of profitability and enacted tax rates 
should any amounts be determined not to be recoverable  or assumptions change  the company would be required to take a charge  which could have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
new pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements will modify accounting for business combinations after september  and will affect the company s treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets at the start of the year  and for acquisitions consummated after june  the statements require that goodwill existing at the date of adoption be reviewed for possible impairment and that impairment tests be periodically repeated  with impaired assets written down to fair value 
additionally  existing goodwill and intangible assets must be assessed and classified with the statement s criteria 
intangible assets with estimated useful lives will continue to be amortized over those periods 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives will cease 
although the company has not yet determined the full impact of these statements on reported results  amortization expense on amortizable intangible assets is expected to be approximately  to  in in june  the fasb issued sfas no

the provisions of this statement generally are to be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its results of operations 
market risk foreign currency risk 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily the result of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in canada  ireland  and the united kingdom 
the company does not currently use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with its foreign subsidiaries 
the assets and liabilities of the company s canadian  irish and united kingdom subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are the canadian dollar  irish pound and british pound  respectively  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the cumulative translation effects for the subsidiaries are included in the cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders equity 
management estimates that had the exchange rate in each country had a devaluation of relative to the us dollar  the company s consolidated earnings before taxes would have decreased by approximately  interest rate risk 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio primarily consisted of institutional money market funds  which due to their short maturities are considered cash equivalents 
the company s primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
these investments  which approximate million at year end  have an average interest rate of approximately and are subject to interest rate risk 
as a result of the average maturity and conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of the company s investments in these investments and its other interest bearing accounts decreased by basis points in  the company s interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the decrease would have occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on the company s future interest income as a result of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s investments 
the company is also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of its various lines of credit  which have variable rates of interest 
the impact on the company s future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s borrowings 
management estimates that had the average interest rate incurred on the company s average borrowings under its lines of credit increased by basis points in  the company s interest expense for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately  this estimate assumes that the increase would have occurred on the first day of borrowings and increased the rate charged by basis points during the term of the borrowing 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
