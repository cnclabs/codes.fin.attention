we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
overview we are a leading developer of high performance  high density and low power embedded memory  standard cell and input output ip components for the design and manufacture of complex integrated circuits or semiconductors 
we license our products to customers for the design of integrated circuits used in complex  high volume applications  such as portable computing devices  cellular phones  consumer multimedia products  automotive electronics  personal computers  workstations and servers 
our customers include foundries  which only manufacture integrated circuits  integrated device manufacturers  which design and manufacture integrated circuits  and companies that design integrated circuits for manufacture by third parties 
integrated circuit manufacturers invest significant resources in libraries that are designed to match their specific manufacturing processes 
our ip library products are designed to enable these manufacturers to achieve the best combination of performance  density  power and yield for a given manufacturing process 
we provide a layer of reliable ip components that help ensure integrated circuits will work to specification before they are manufactured 
this process interface layer is important since every integrated circuit design must be mapped into a specific manufacturing process to achieve targeted performance and yield 
as a result  integrated circuit designers view optimized ip components as a critical link between the design of an integrated circuit and the manufacturing process 
typically  an integrated circuit manufacturer licenses one or more products designed for its manufacturing process that is accompanied by layout databases  views to support a customer s design tool environment and design methodology documentation 
we license our products on a nonexclusive  worldwide basis to major integrated circuit manufacturers and grant these manufacturers the right to distribute our products to their internal design teams and to their integrated circuit design customers 
we charge manufacturers a license fee that gives them the right to manufacture integrated circuits containing products we have developed for their manufacturing process 
in addition  manufacturers agree to pay us royalties based on manufacturing volumes of integrated circuits that include our products 
a portion of such royalty payments is then credited back to the manufacturer s account to be applied against future license fees  if any  payable by such manufacturer 
for most of our integrated circuit manufacturing customers  we perform all or part of the distribution and licensing of our products to the integrated circuit design companies that use such manufacturers to produce their designs 
in performing this distribution and licensing function  we have licensed our products to over  design companies 
when distributing our products to integrated circuit design companies  we make the core set of our product libraries available to our licensed companies at no charge 
we also provide customized ip component products and services to our licensed customers on a separate fee basis 
we have several industry partner programs whereby our partners provide a wide variety of ip solutions  design services and tool support to streamline the design process for users of our ip components 
through these programs  we provide products and support to over companies who use these products in support of our licensed users 
sources of revenue the license of our products to a integrated circuit manufacturer typically involves a sales cycle of six to nine months and often coincides with a customer s migration to a new manufacturing process 
our contracts with customers generally require them to pay a license fee to us ranging from approximately  to  for each product delivered under a contract 
our contracts generally require payment of a portion of the license fees upon signing of the contract with the final payment due within to days after delivery  which generally takes six to nine months 
we have been dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  although the customers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues and synopsys accounted for of total revenues 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues  sharp accounted for of total revenues and nec accounted for of total revenues 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts and the number of designs utilizing our products 
we derive a substantial majority of our total revenues from license fees associated with the sale of product licenses  including support and maintenance fees 
together  these license  support and maintenance fees accounted for of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal we expect that license revenue will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
royalty revenue is calculated based on unit sales by manufacturers of integrated circuits or wafers containing our ip components 
license arrangements dictate royalty reporting by each customer on either a per chip or per wafer basis 
given that we provide our products early in the customer s integrated circuit design process  there is a delay of approximately three to four years  if at all  between the time we deliver a product and the time we receive royalty revenue when the semiconductors incorporating our products are manufactured and sold 
to date  a substantial portion of our net royalty revenue has been derived from one customer  tsmc  which accounted for of net royalty revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal royalty rates may vary among customers  and in certain cases  with respect to specific process geometries  or product generations  may decline over time 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to generate royalty revenue from a substantially larger number of designs and on many of these designs achieving large manufacturing volumes 
net royalty revenue as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect royalty revenue to grow as a percentage of total revenues  however  we expect that royalty revenue as a percentage of total revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
for example  net royalty revenue as a percentage of total revenues was in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in the third quarter of fiscal  in the second quarter of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty costs  goodwill impairments  contingencies  restructuring costs and other special charges and taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is a significant accounting policy for us because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition as amended by statement of position and statement of position  as well as accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  however  judgments may affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue in any given period is difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we recognize and report revenue in two separate categories license revenue and net royalty revenue 
license revenue is comprised of license fees  maintenance fees and support fees 
license fees are derived from the purchase of a license for our products 
maintenance fees are derived from maintenance contracts  which form part of a licensing arrangement 
support fees are derived from arrangements with customers of our licensed foundries to support the use of our libraries in their designs 
royalty revenue is derived from fees associated with the volume of a licensee s production and sales of semiconductors or wafers containing our intellectual property or ip 
license revenue for all licenses  we use both a binding purchase order and a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we assess cash collectibility based on a number of factors  including past collection history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
in cases where a customer s credit worthiness is uncertain  we require a letter of credit as assurance of payment 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes probable 
for licensed products which do not require significant customization of the company s ip component  license revenue is generally recognized when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
for licensed products requiring significant customization of our ip component  license revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service agreements accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remains accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on engagements is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
costs incurred in advance of billings are recorded as costs in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts 
if the amounts of revenue recognized exceed the amounts received from customers  the excess amount is recorded as unbilled contract receivables 
if the amounts billed exceed the amounts of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in development 
significant management judgment and discretion is used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviation from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized in any period 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those licensed products and services when sold separately and  for maintenance  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in license arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined 
when the fair value of a license element has not been established  we use the residual method to record license revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
maintenance fees are derived from maintenance contracts  which are part of the licensing arrangement 
maintenance fees include telephone and email support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
first year maintenance is typically sold with the related licensed product and may be renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance fees are deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
vendor specific objective evidence of maintenance is generally determined based on renewal rates stated in individual contracts 
support fees are derived from arrangements with customers of our licensed foundries to support the use of our libraries in their designs 
support fees include telephone and email support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades on a when an if available basis 
support fees are recognized ratably over the support period 
support is generally for a period of months and may be renewed on an annual basis 
royalty revenue royalty revenue is recognized based on royalty reports received from our customers  generally on a one quarter lag basis 
according to contract terms  a portion of each royalty payment is credited back to the customer s account for use as payment of license fees for future orders placed with us 
the remaining portion of the royalty is reported as net royalty revenue 
the amount of credits that can be earned by a customer is limited to the cumulative amount of orders placed by that customer for a given process technology 
a customer has a limited time to use the credits before they expire  generally months from the time royalties are earned 
as a result  we defer any royalty revenue associated with our credit back program until the customer purchases additional licenses or the credit back expires  whichever is earlier 
if the customer does not use the credits within this period  we record the amount of expired credits as net royalty revenue as we no longer have an obligation to provide any future products for such expired credits 
historically  customers have utilized substantially all credit backs to purchase our licensed products prior to expiration of such credit backs 
when credit backs are utilized  we recognize the resulting license revenue when our revenue recognition criteria have been met 
warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates and the expected labor costs to provide warranty services 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or costs of servicing warranty claims were greater than the expectations on which the accrual had been based  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
the impact of any such change or deviation may be increased by our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our total revenues 
goodwill impairments on october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to analyze our goodwill for impairment 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances whenever events may indicate an impairment exists 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical and future taxable income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as of september   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of any deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
acquisitions on october   we announced a definitive agreement to acquire nurlogic  a privately held technology firm headquartered in san diego  california 
nurlogic supplies high performance mixed signal and communications ip to the semiconductor industry 
under the terms of the agreement  we expect to acquire nurlogic for consideration of approximately million consisting of cash and stock 
this acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal our acquisition of nurlogic is expected to result in a significant increase in our costs and expenses relating primarily to the increased headcount and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
this acquisition will affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we acquired certain assets of synopsys physical library business for approximately million 
we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements outline the details of the purchase price allocation and pro forma financial information related to the acquisition 
upon consummation of our acquisition of certain assets of the synopsys physical library business  we immediately charged to expense million representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in fiscal  the acquisition of certain assets of synopsys physical library business resulted in a significant increase in our costs and expenses relating primarily to the increased headcount and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the acquisition 
in fiscal  we ceased amortization of goodwill in accordance with sfas the acquisition has affected the comparability of our consolidated financial statements

general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to higher provision for doubtful accounts of  increased headcount and personnel related expenses of approximately  increased use of contractors of approximately  increased costs for legal  accounting services and directors and officers insurance of approximately  and increased travel of approximately  the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts was due to an increase in our past due receivables 
acquisition related expenses fiscal percent inc dec fiscal percent inc dec fiscal in thousands in process research and development  n a amortization of purchased intangible assets   n a amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce  n a acquisition related expenses   n a the amount expensed to in process research and development was related to our acquisition of certain assets of synopsys physical library business in january and was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the existing purchased technology and patents  as well as the technology under development  was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate used in the present value calculations was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the particular technologies and the development life cycle 
we consider the pricing model for products related to this acquisition to be standard within the high technology industry 
however we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize in emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue and expense projections assuming the products have entered the market  and discount rates based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may result in impairment charges 
the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was attributable to the timing of the acquisition in fiscal the decrease in the amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce was attributable to the adoption of sfas in fiscal as a result  we ceased amortization of goodwill on october  we expect acquisition related expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to our proposed acquisition of nurlogic 
interest and other expense income  net fiscal percent inc dec fiscal percent inc dec fiscal in thousands   interest and other expense income decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflected a lower rate of return on our investment portfolio in combined with an increase of million in the loss provision related to our unused leased facility 
interest and other expense income decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflected a lower rate of return on our investment portfolio as well as a lower portfolio balance during fiscal  combined with a loss provision of million related to our unused leased facility 
the lower investment balance was a result of cash paid for our acquisition of certain assets of the synopsys physical library business 
provision for income taxes fiscal percent inc dec fiscal percent inc dec fiscal in thousands  the income tax provision was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal the tax provision in fiscal was a result of the alternative minimum tax and foreign withholding tax 
the tax provision in fiscal was a result of a full valuation allowance provided against the deferred tax assets that had been carried on our books 
the valuation allowance was established due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of the benefit of such assets 
the tax provision in fiscal was due to the operating income in fiscal the difference between the statutory and effective rates of income tax is due to the impact of state taxes and tax free interest income and tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily from revenue from continuing operations from inception to september   the net proceeds of million from our february initial public offering  the net proceeds of million from our april secondary offering and  to a lesser extent  the proceeds of approximately million from the sale of preferred stock and a warrant prior to our initial public offering 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million was primarily attributable to the net income of million  an increase in accounts payable of  an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in other liabilities of million and non cash related charges of million  partially offset by an increase in contract receivables of million  an increase in prepaid and other currents assets of  and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million

net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million was primarily attributable to the net income of million  an increase in deferred revenue of  an increase in accrued liabilities of  and non cash charges of million  offset by a decrease in accounts payable of  and a decrease in deferred taxes of million 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to fluctuations in our operating results  shipment linearity  accounts receivable collections and the timing of tax and other payments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million was attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment of million and a net increase in purchases of marketable securities of million

net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in all three fiscal years  financing activities consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options or our employee stock purchase plan 
on october   we announced a definitive agreement to acquire nurlogic for a purchase price of approximately million consisting of million in cash and the remaining balance in common stock 
our acquisition of nurlogic is expected to result in a significant increase in our costs and expenses relating primarily to the increased headcount and amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with the acquisition 
this acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is expected to close in the second quarter of our fiscal we intend to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities and our international operations  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the costs and timing of future acquisitions  if any  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other ip rights  the level and timing of license and royalty revenue  available borrowings under line of credit arrangements  if any  and other factors 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and any cash generated from operations and from potential future debt financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  from time to time  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases on our facilities  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
additionally  we have not entered into any derivative contracts  nor do we have any synthetic leases 
at september   we had no foreign currency contracts outstanding 
the following table represents the future minimum annual lease payments of the company as of september  in thousands fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and thereafter  total minimum annual lease payments  we rent our current office facility in sunnyvale  california under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in under the terms of the lease  we are responsible for a proportionate amount of taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs 
we continue to lease our previous office facility in sunnyvale under a non cancelable lease that expires in september we are actively seeking a sub tenant for this building 
as a result  we have accrued a loss of million for the anticipated loss on subleasing the facility  including the estimated commission expenses relating to the sublease 
we also lease facilities for our sales and support offices in paris  france and tokyo  japan  which expire in and  respectively 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period and have accrued for rent expense incurred  but not paid 
net rent expense was million in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
factors affecting future operating results our business depends on continued demand for complex system on a chip semiconductors and the electronic equipment that incorporate them our business is substantially dependent on the adoption of our technology by semiconductor manufacturers and on an increasing demand for products requiring complex system on a chip integrated circuits  such as portable computing devices  cellular phones  consumer multimedia products  automotive electronics  personal computers and workstations 
a system on a chip is a semiconductor that includes the computing  memory and communications components that previously had been available only on separate chips 
our business is subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success of our customers including  among others  competition faced by each customer in its particular industry  market acceptance of the customer s products that incorporate our technology  the engineering  sales and marketing capabilities of the customer and the financial and other resources of the customer 
demand for our products may also be affected by mergers in the semiconductor and related industries  which may reduce the aggregate level of purchases of our products and services by the combined companies 
if there is a retraction or growth falters in the semiconductor and related industries  a reduced number of design starts  shifts in the types of integrated circuits manufactured  tightening of customers operating budgets or consolidation among our customers  our business could suffer 
the semiconductor and electronics products industries are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  short product life cycles  fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures 
each of these industries is highly cyclical and has periodically experienced significant downturns  often in connection with or in anticipation of decline in general economic conditions during which the number of new semiconductor design projects often decreases 
revenue generated from licensing depends in large part on the rate at which semiconductor manufacturers adopt new product generations  which  in turn  is affected by the level of demand for semiconductors 
revenue generated from royalties depends on production and sale of integrated circuits or wafers that incorporate our technology 
if the semiconductor and electronics products industries experience a downturn  then our business could suffer 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and a general economic downturn in the united states or abroad may reduce our revenue and harm our business the primary customers for our ip components are semiconductor design and manufacturing companies 
any significant downturn in our customers markets  or domestic and global conditions which result in the reduction of research and development budgets or the delay of software purchases by our customers would likely result in a decline in demand for our ip components and services and could harm our business 
in addition  the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical 
for example  in previous years certain asian countries have experienced significant economic difficulties  including currency devaluation and instability  business failures and a depressed business environment 
these difficulties have coincided with a significant downturn in the semiconductor market  resulting in reduced budgets for chip design tools  which  in turn  has negatively impacted us 
the semiconductor industry suffered a sharp decline in orders and revenue in and this weakness has continued throughout many semiconductor manufacturers and vendors of products incorporating semiconductors have announced earnings shortfalls and employee layoffs 
we believe these conditions have negatively affected the rate of growth of our revenue  and may negatively affect our business in the future if these conditions persist 
the outlook for the electronics industry is uncertain and it is very difficult to predict how long the current downturn will last 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could cause our stock price to decline our operating results have fluctuated in the past as a result of a number of factors including the relatively large size and small number of customer orders we receive during a given period  the timing of customer orders  including the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers  the size and timing of production by our customers of chips containing our ip components  the gain or loss by us of a large semiconductor manufacturing customer or the gain or loss by such customer of a major order of chips containing our ip components  delays in the design process due to changes by a customer to its order after it is placed  our progress on contracts that are billed and recognized to revenue on a percentage of completion basis  which represent a substantial majority of our contracts and have completion periods of six to nine months  the accuracy of our estimates for project completion costs and costs incurred to date  which estimates involve significant management judgment and discretion  the length of our sales cycle  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements  the timing of our new product announcements and introductions and those of our competitors  market acceptance of our products  and fluctuations in the demand for semiconductors and end user products that incorporate semiconductors 
our future revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and on an annual basis as a result of these and other factors 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue 
if revenue is below our expectations in any quarter and we are not able to adjust spending in a timely manner  the negative effect of such shortfall may be increased 
we intend to continue our investment in product development as well as in product promotion  licensing and support programs in an effort to maximize the growth of future royalties 
accordingly  it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline  perhaps substantially 
we have incurred operating losses in recent periods and may be unable to maintain profitability although we were profitable in fiscal as a whole  we incurred net operating losses in the first six months of fiscal  in fiscal and fiscal if our revenue in future periods increases more slowly than we expect  or not at all  we may not maintain profitability 
in addition  most of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term  so any shortfall in anticipated revenue in a given period could significantly reduce our operating results below expectations 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with funding for product development  operational and administrative activities and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we will need to increase revenue to maintain profitability 
we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we fail to maintain profitability  our business and financial condition would suffer  we could lose the benefit of tax credits and other deferred tax assets and our stock price could decline 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on royalties as a key component of our business model and if we fail to realize expected royalties our business will suffer royalty payments are calculated based on per unit sales by our customers of integrated circuits or wafers containing our ip components 
we believe that our long term success is substantially dependent on future royalties 
we face risks inherent in a royalty based business model  such as the rate of incorporation of our ip components into semiconductor designs  the rate of adoption of our ip components by semiconductor manufacturers  and the demand for products incorporating such integrated circuits 
additionally  our ability to forecast and realize royalty revenue is limited by factors that are beyond our control 
such factors include the timing of the manufacture of royalty bearing integrated circuits  the price charged by semiconductor manufacturers to their customers for royalty bearing integrated circuits  and the quantity of royalty bearing integrated circuits ordered and actually manufactured 
even if our ip components are used in a product that achieves commercial success  the royalty rate that we negotiate with our customers varies  and in certain cases  with respect to specific process geometries  or product generations  declines over time 
accordingly  on a period to period basis  net royalty revenue as a percentage of our total revenues may vary significantly 
net royalty revenue as a percentage of our total revenues was in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in the third quarter  in the second quarter  and in the first quarter 
there is significant delay and uncertainty between the delivery of our ip components and the generation of royalty revenue 
in addition to the factors described above  this delay and uncertainty is due to the delivery and application of our products early in the integrated circuit design process and delays in our recognition of royalty revenue 
we recognize royalty revenue in the quarter in which we receive a royalty report from a customer  provided that other conditions to revenue recognition have been satisfied 
as a result  our recognition of royalty revenue typically lags behind the quarter in which the related chip is sold by our customer by at least one quarter 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful in expanding the number of royalty bearing contracts with customers  nor can we be certain that we will receive significant royalty revenue in the future 
we also face risks relating to the accuracy and completeness of the royalty collection process 
our ability to generate royalty revenue depends  in part  on our ability to negotiate  structure  monitor and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties 
we have only limited experience and systems in place to conduct reviews of the accuracy of the royalty reports we receive from our licensees 
we have the right to audit the records of semiconductor manufacturers who license our products to help ensure the integrity of their royalty reporting systems  however  such audits may only be conducted periodically and may be at our expense 
we cannot be certain that the costs incurred by us to improve our systems and processes and in conducting these audits will not exceed the royalties that result from these efforts 
if the market for third party ip components does not expand  our business may suffer our ability to achieve sustained revenue growth and profitability in the future will depend on the continued development of the market for third party ip components and  to a large extent  on the demand for system on a chip integrated circuits 
system on a chip integrated circuits are characterized by rapid technological change and competition from an increasing number of alternate design strategies such as combining multiple chips to create a system on package 
we cannot be certain that the market for third party ip components and system on a chip integrated circuits will continue to develop or grow at a rate sufficient to support our business 
if either of these markets fails to grow or develops slower than expected  then our business may suffer 
a significant majority of our existing and potential customers currently rely on components developed internally and or by other vendors 
our future growth  if any  is dependent on the adoption of  and increased reliance on  third party design components by both existing and potential customers 
we continue to experience intense competition from other ip component providers  semiconductor manufacturers and electronic design automation companies  and this competition could negatively affect our business and our revenue our strategy of targeting semiconductor manufacturers and integrated circuit design companies that participate in  or may enter  the system on a chip market requires us to compete in intensely competitive markets 
we face significant competition from third party ip component providers  such as dolphin integration sa  faraday technology corporation  leda systems  inc  verisilicon microelectronics shanghai co  ltd  virage logic corporation and virtual silicon technology  inc  and from the internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers  such as tsmc 
in addition  we face competition from small consulting firms and design companies that operate in the library segment of the market and offer a limited selection of specialized ip components 
we face significant competition from the internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers that have expanded their manufacturing capabilities and portfolio of ip components to participate in the system on a chip market 
semiconductor manufacturers that license our products have historically had their own internal ip component design groups 
these design groups continue to compete with us for access to the parent s ip component requisitions and  in some cases  compete with us to supply ip components to third parties on a merchant basis 
ip components developed by internal design groups are designed to utilize the qualities of their own manufacturing process  and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  informational  cost and technical advantages 
if internal design groups expand their product offerings to compete directly with our products or actively seek to participate as vendors in the ip component market  then our revenue and operating results could be negatively affected 
tsmc  our largest customer  has announced that it intends to more aggressively supply internally developed ip components for its manufacturing processes to integrated circuit designers through multiple library and eda tool partners  including our competitors 
tsmc has substantially greater financial  manufacturing and other resources  name recognition and market presence than us and the internal design group at tsmc has greater access to technical information about tsmc s manufacturing processes 
distribution partners selected by tsmc may have greater resources  name recognition and distribution networks than us 
if tsmc is successful in supplying ip components to third parties either directly or through distribution arrangements with other companies  then our revenue and operating results could be negatively affected 
we may also face competition from vendors such as cadence  mentor graphics and synopsys  which supply eda software tools 
ip component offerings from leading eda companies may benefit from greater integration into eda tool design flows and may also benefit from distribution through more established and widely used distribution networks 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against such eda companies 
in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of the physical library business of synopsys in january  synopsys agreed that it would not engage in the development  sale  marketing or support of certain ip components for a period of two years commencing in january if  upon termination of this restriction  synopsys elects to engage in the development  sale  marketing or support of ip components that compete with our ip components  our revenue and operating results could be negatively affected 
synopsys recently acquired avant corporation  including its physical library business  which competes against us 
we believe that the january agreements between us and synopsys require synopsys to suspend operations of such business  other than maintenance and support of existing contracts  until january and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to sell such business to a third party  subject to our right of first refusal 
if synopsys sells the avant physical library business to a third party or elects to operate such business itself  then our revenue and operating results could be negatively affected 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from new market entrants with products that may be less expensive than ours or that may provide better performance or additional features not currently provided by our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  lower cost structures and larger customer bases than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  some of our principal competitors maintain their own design tools and ip component libraries which allow them to offer a single vendor solution 
our ability to compete successfully in the market for ip components will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control including  but not limited to our success in designing new products  our ability to implement new designs at smaller process geometries  access to adequate eda tools many of which are licensed from our current or potential competitors  access to adequate technical information from semiconductor manufacturers many of which are actual or potential competitors  the price  quality and timing of our new product introductions and those of our competitors  the emergence of new ip component interchangeability standards  the widespread licensing of ip components by semiconductor manufacturers or their design groups to third party manufacturers  our ability to protect our ip  market acceptance of our ip components  success of competitive products  and continued market acceptance of products using system on a chip integrated circuits and industry and general economic conditions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully in the market for third party ip components 
if we fail to enhance our ip component libraries and develop and introduce new products on a timely basis  we may not be able to address the needs of our customers  our technology may become obsolete and our results of operations may be harmed our customers compete in the semiconductor industry  which is subject to rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and requirements and evolving industry standards 
the development of new manufacturing processes  the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
accordingly  our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and that keep pace with new product introductions  emerging manufacturing process technologies and other technological developments in the semiconductor industry 
if we fail to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in manufacturing processes or customer requirements  or if we experience significant delays in product development  our business and operating results may be negatively affected 
we cannot be certain that we will avoid difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful introduction  development and sale of new or enhanced products or that such new or enhanced products will achieve market acceptance 
if we do not satisfy our delivery commitments  then we could also be exposed to litigation or claims from our customers 
any such claim could have a material negative effect on our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in the progress of certain projects  and we may continue to experience such delays in the future 
any delay or failure to achieve progress could result in damage to customer relationships and our reputation  underutilization of engineering resources  delay in the market acceptance of our products and a decline in revenue  any of which could negatively affect our business 
our sales cycle is unpredictable and may be more than twelve months  so we may fail to adequately adjust our resources and expenses to anticipated or actual demand in any given period or meet market expectations the license of our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by the customer and a purchase will often be timed to coincide with a customer s migration to a new manufacturing process 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available ip or ip solutions and require that we expend substantial time  effort and resources to educate them about the value of our products 
despite these efforts  potential customers may select an alternate solution or delay or forego a license of our products 
as a result  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically ranging from six to nine months 
our ability to forecast the timing and scope of specific sales is limited 
once we receive and accept an order for a customized product from a customer  we must commit significant resources to customizing our products for the customer s manufacturing process 
we generate a substantial majority of our license revenue from customized products 
this customization is complex and time consuming and is subject to a number of risks over which we have little or no control 
these risks include the customer s alterations of its manufacturing process or the timing of its migration to a new process 
typically  this customization  once started  takes from six to nine months to complete 
if we fail to adequately adjust our resources and expenses to meet actual demand  our business may suffer 
if anticipated orders fail to materialize  we may be unable to reduce our resources and expenses in time and our operating results could suffer 
in addition  where customer orders exceed our anticipated demand  we may be unable to deliver customized products in time to meet our customer s requirements 
any such delays in product customization and delivery  whether due to capacity constraints or otherwise  give rise to the risk of cancellation or alteration of customer orders 
in the last half of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal we experienced an increase in customer orders that has placed a strain on our product customization resources and increased the time it takes for us to deliver customized products to our customers 
while we have increased and continue to increase our engineering capacity  we cannot be certain that such capacity will match demand in future periods 
contracts for customized products are billed and recognized to revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
our revenue recognition and cost management practices are based on estimates for project completion costs and costs incurred to date 
accordingly  if there are delays in product customization  our operating results could suffer 
due to the significant dollar amounts represented by a single customer order  the timing of the receipt of an order can have a significant impact on our revenue for a particular period 
because our revenue is concentrated among a small number of customers  a decline or a delay in the recognition of revenue from one customer in a period may cause our operating results in such period to be negatively affected 
the unpredictability of our sales cycle makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results of operations for any given period 
if we do not correctly predict the timing of our customers purchases  then the amount of revenue we recognize in a given quarter could be negatively impacted  which could harm our operating results 
if we fail to obtain new orders from customers or fail to collect outstanding accounts receivable our business may be negatively affected 
if we were to experience a delay in our orders  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts or investors expectations for a given quarter and ultimately result in the decrease of our stock price 
further  if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general  it would negatively affect the timing of our revenue recognition  which would cause us to fail to meet market expectations and our stock price to suffer 
we face risks from sales to foreign customers and foreign operations  which could reduce our operating results and harm our financial condition historically  a large portion of our total revenues has been derived from customers located outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal revenue from taiwan as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we anticipate that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of our total revenues in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
if our competitors denominate their sales in a currency that becomes relatively inexpensive in comparison to the us dollar  then we may experience fewer orders from international customers whose business is based primarily on the less expensive currency 
we are facing increased pressure from our customers in europe to denominate our sales to such customers in the european union euro 
in addition  present or future dislocations with respect to international financial markets may materially harm our business 
we intend to expand our sales  marketing and design activities in asia and europe 
we are currently establishing an engineering services and support facility in bangalore  india 
international expansion will result in increased costs and may not be successful  which could harm our business 
our expansion of international activity and dependence on customers outside the united states involves a number of risks including the impact of possible recessions in economies outside the united states  political and economic instability  including such instability arising from relations between taiwan and the peoples republic of china  exchange rate fluctuations  longer accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  compliance with  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  which could prevent us from delivering our products into markets outside the united states  reduced or limited protection for ip rights  significant difficulties in enforcement of contractual rights  such as royalty rights  ip rights  such as infringement claims  and other legal rights  export license requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  and tariffs and other trade barriers and potentially adverse tax consequences 
if we are unable to sustain or increase revenue derived from international customers or minimize the foregoing risks  our business may be materially and negatively affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on license revenue for a substantial portion of our revenue  and a decline in sales of licenses could cause our income to decline we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from license fees  including support and maintenance fees  associated with the sale of our products 
license fees accounted for of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that license revenue will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
if license revenue were to decline  our business would suffer in the short term  and our royalty revenue may decline in the long term as fewer semiconductors incorporate our products 
our future license revenue will depend in part on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new products 
because we rely on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline if our existing customers do not continue to purchase and use our products we have been dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our total revenues  although the customers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues and synopsys accounted for of total revenues 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues  sharp accounted for of total revenues and nec accounted for of total revenues 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future 
the companies considered to be our major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts and the number of designs produced that utilize our products 
none of our customers have a written agreement with us that obligates them to license future generations of products or new products from us  and we cannot be certain that any customer will license ip components from us in the future 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any of our customers will produce products incorporating our technology or that  if such production occurs  they will generate significant royalty revenue 
if one or more of our major customers stops licensing our products  reduces their orders  fails to pay license or royalty fees due or does not produce products containing our ip components  then our operating results could be materially and negatively affected 
tsmc  our largest customer  has announced that it intends to more aggressively supply internally developed ip components for its manufacturing processes to integrated circuit designers through multiple library and eda tool partners  including our competitors 
tsmc has substantially greater financial  manufacturing and other resources  name recognition and market presence than us and the internal design group at tsmc has greater access to technical information about tsmc s manufacturing processes 
distribution partners selected by tsmc may have greater resources  name recognition and distribution networks than us 
if tsmc is successful in supplying ip components to third parties either directly or through distribution arrangements with other companies  then our revenue and operating results could be negatively affected 
we face numerous risks in successfully obtaining orders from customers on terms consistent with our business model  including  among others  the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential customer before reaching an agreement with such party to license our products  persuading large semiconductor manufacturers to work with  to rely for critical technology on  and to disclose proprietary information to a smaller company  such as ours  and persuading potential customers to bear certain development costs associated with development of customized components 
there are a relatively limited number of semiconductor manufacturers to which we can license our technology in a manner consistent with our business model and we cannot be certain that such manufacturers will rely on merchant ip components or adopt our products 
if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  our ability to manage our business and continue our growth would be negatively impacted our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
none of our senior management  key technical personnel or key sales personnel is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key man life insurance covering our key personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group 
if we are unable to effectively integrate and utilize newly hired engineering  management or sales personnel  the execution of our business strategy and our ability to react to changing market conditions may be impeded and our business could suffer 
competition for personnel is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining effective personnel 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or experience delays in the integration of new personnel in the united states and abroad  our business and operations may suffer 
our historical growth and acquisitions have placed and future acquisitions might place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and we may be unable to effectively control our costs and implement our business strategies as a result our ability to license our products and manage our business successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
our historical growth  international expansion  acquisition of certain assets and personnel from synopsys in january and expected acquisition of nurlogic have placed  and are expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
we are currently in the process of establishing a design facility in india and we plan to open offices in china 
the number of our employees or full time equivalents has increased from on september  to on september  furthermore  approximately employees are expected to join us upon completion of our acquisition of nurlogic and establishment of our new office in bangalore  india 
despite the time and resources invested in the acquisition of nurlogic  there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated 
our international expansion is expected to result in increased costs associated with the commencement of operations 
if our international operations are unsuccessful  our business and results of operations would be negatively affected 
our customers rely heavily on our technological expertise in designing  testing and manufacturing products incorporating our ip components 
relationships with new customers generally require significant engineering support 
as a result  any increase in the demand for our products will increase the strain on our personnel  particularly our engineers 
our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures are also limited 
our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis 
if we fail to do so  our business could be harmed 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to implement our business plan 
we also cannot be sure that our revenue will continue to grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with our increased personnel 
if we are not able to effectively integrate and develop the operations of nurlogic or future acquisitions  our business may suffer our acquisition of nurlogic is expected to close  subject to customary closing conditions  in january upon the closing of this transaction  we intend to integrate the workforce and operations of nurlogic into our organizational structure and work towards the effective utilization of the additional workforce 
we face various risks as a result of this planned acquisition including  but not limited to  difficulty in satisfying the conditions to closing this acquisition  retaining and motivating nurlogic s employees  retaining and developing nurlogic s customers  combining the technology  operations and work force of nurlogic and realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisition  substantial unanticipated integration costs  and disruption of our ongoing business 
if we are not able to successfully develop and commercially exploit nurlogic s business  our business may be negatively affected in future periods  which may cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  if the value of intangible assets acquired becomes impaired  we may be required to write down the value of such assets  which would negatively affect our financial results 
if our efforts to refocus nurlogic s business and integrate it with our existing business are not successful  our future revenue and operating results could be negatively affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we may continue to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we buy a company or a division of a company  we may experience difficulty assimilating that company or division s personnel and operations  which could negatively affect our operating results 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities as we have in past acquisitions to pay for any future acquisition  the issuance of which would involve restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
our expected acquisition of nurlogic will make planning and predicting our future growth rates and operating results more difficult our expected acquisition of nurlogic may reduce our revenue growth rate and make prediction of our future revenue  costs and expenses and operating results more difficult 
we expect the strategic and operational integration of the nurlogic business to make prediction of our future revenue  costs and expenses and operating results more difficult because our results of operations in future periods will reflect an expanded workforce and product development effort and changed customer base 
due to the expected acquisition  we may not be able to accurately predict how the combined business will evolve  the possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of the combined businesses  the impairment of goodwill resulting from the acquisition  and the effect of new accounting standards or policy changes directed by the financial accounting standard board or other regulatory body on future operating results 
we are in the process of establishing our first remote engineering sites which  if not structured and managed effectively  could cause our product development efforts and our overall business to suffer we are currently in the process of establishing an engineering services and support office in bangalore  india 
in addition  subject to the closing of our proposed acquisition of nurlogic  we expect to have engineering services performed in san diego  california 
we have no prior experience in establishing or operating engineering centers outside of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our expansion of engineering operations to remotely situated offices presents a number of risks including increased difficulty in coordinating our engineering efforts  increased costs associated with establishing remote offices  obtaining required equipment and tools and training new personnel  increased communications and travel costs  and potential delays in our engineering efforts 
if we are not able to preserve the value of the ip included in our products  our business will suffer we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to enforce our patents  trademarks or copyrights or to protect our trade secrets  our business could suffer  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we cannot be certain that our ip rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in certain instances  we have elected to rely on trade secret law rather than patent law to protect our proprietary technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees and customers 
we cannot be certain that these contracts have not and will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
effective ip protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we may experience difficulty protecting our ip from misuse or infringement by others in foreign countries 
the risks associated with protection of our ip in foreign countries are likely to increase as we expand our international operations 
an infringement claim or a significant damage award would adversely impact our operating results substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding ip rights exist in our industry 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other ip rights to technologies that are important to our business 
we cannot be certain that we would ultimately prevail in any such dispute or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
any infringement claim brought against us  regardless of the duration  outcome or size of damage award  could result in substantial cost to us  divert our management s attention and resources  be time consuming to defend  result in substantial damage awards  cause product shipment delays  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by us could have a material negative affect on our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in any potential dispute involving our ip  our customers and strategic partners could also become the target of litigation 
this could trigger our technical support and indemnification obligations in our license agreements  which could result in substantial expense to us 
in addition to the time and expense required for us to supply such support or indemnification to our customers and strategic partners  any such litigation could severely disrupt or shut down the business of our customers and strategic partners  which in turn would hurt our relations with our customers and strategic partners and cause licenses for our products to decrease 
defects in our proprietary technologies and ip components could decrease our revenue and our competitive market share if the ip components we provide to a customer contain defects that increase our customer s cost of goods sold and time to market  these defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance of our ip components 
any actual or perceived defects with our products may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers  leading to a decrease in our revenue 
these defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new proprietary technologies or enhancements to existing proprietary technologies 
our ip components may contain errors not discovered until after customer utilization of the ip components provided by us 
if our products contain errors or defects  it could require us to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems  which could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts 
our future capital needs may require that we seek additional debt or equity funding which  if not available  could cause our business to suffer we intend to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the costs and timing of expansion of our international operations  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the costs and timing of future acquisitions  if any  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other ip rights  the level and timing of license and royalty revenue  and available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and other factors 
from time to time  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be certain that such funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  our business will be negatively affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 
semiconductor fabrication facilities are subject to risk of natural disasters  which  if they were to occur  could harm our revenue semiconductor fabrication facilities have in the past experienced major reductions in foundry capacity due to earthquakes in taiwan  japan and california 
for example  in taiwan experienced several earthquakes which impacted foundries due to power outages  physical damage and employee dislocation 
the royalty component of our revenue is directly related to the manufacture and sale of semiconductors containing our ip components  and  as a result  our business could suffer if a major customer s manufacturing capacity was adversely affected by a natural disaster such as an earthquake  fire  tornado or flood 
our stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control  and those fluctuations may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit the trading price of our common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our results of operations  announcements regarding our product developments  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  announcements of competitive product introductions by our competitors or our customers  release of reports by securities analysts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  changes in security analysts recommendations  and developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or other events 
if our revenue and results of operations are below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors  then significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could occur 
in addition  the securities markets have  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and which often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against that company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and would at a minimum divert management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  which could further reduce our stock price 
any adverse decision in such litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
our charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers or prevent changes in our management our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of such shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
if we issue any of these shares of preferred stock in the future  the rights of holders of our common stock may be negatively affected 
if we issue preferred stock  a change of control of our company could be delayed  deferred or prevented 
we have no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with any interested stockholder as defined by that statute 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
these provisions include cumulative voting for the election of directors  the elimination of actions by written consent of stockholders  and the establishment of an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals and director nominations to be acted upon at annual meetings of the stockholders 
on december   our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under this plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of our common stock 
each right initially entitles stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for however  the rights are not immediately exercisable 
if a person or group acquires  or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of a certain percentage of our common stock  then  unless the rights are redeemed by us for per right  the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders  except the acquiring person or group  for shares of our preferred stock or of the third party acquirer having a value of twice the right s then current exercise price 
these provisions are designed to encourage potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors and give our board of directors an opportunity to consider various alternatives to increase stockholder value 
these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy contests 
however  the potential issuance of preferred stock  our charter and bylaw provisions  the restrictions in section of the delaware general corporation law and our stockholder rights plan could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
such provisions and plans may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
future changes in accounting standards  specifically changes affecting methods of revenue recognition  could cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations future changes in accounting standards including those affecting revenue recognition  could require us to change our accounting policies 
if a change in accounting standards caused us to defer of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerate recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  we may not meet securities analysts and investors expectations 
any such shortfalls could have an adverse impact on our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our marketable securities 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers and the us government 
our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the carrying values approximate fair values at september  and all marketable securities mature in one year or less 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities carrying value at september  in thousands average rate of return at september  annualized carrying value at september  in thousands average rate of return at september  annualized cash and cash equivalents variable rate  money market funds variable rate cash and cash equivalents fixed rate  marketable securities fixed rate  total   currency risk historically  a large portion of our total revenues has been generated from outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenues was approximately for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal we anticipate that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of our total revenues in the future 
as all of our sales are currently denominated in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we face increasing pressure from our customers in europe to denominate our sales to such customers in euro 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have not historically engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions
