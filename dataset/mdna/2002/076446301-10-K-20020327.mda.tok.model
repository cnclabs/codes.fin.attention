such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the sections entitled potential factors affecting future operating results and qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk below 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof

critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to asset impairment  deferred assets  rental income recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that currently is available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
real estate investments are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of real estate includes the purchase price or development cost of the properties and other related acquisition costs 
development costs include interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction period and development fees paid to bedford acquisitions  inc bai 
see related party transactions for a description of bai 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed 
expenditures for asset replacements or significant improvements that extend the life or increase the property s value are capitalized 
real estate properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate an impairment of a property  the company will recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the property 
real estate investments that are considered held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and such properties are no longer depreciated 
costs incurred for debt financing and property leasing are capitalized as deferred costs 
deferred loan costs include amounts paid to lenders and others to obtain financing and amounts paid to bai 
such costs are amortized over the term of the related loan 
amortization of deferred financing costs is included in interest expense in the company s income statement 
deferred leasing costs include leasing commissions that are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the related lease 
deferred leasing costs are included with the basis when a property is sold and therefore reduce the gain on sale 
unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense in the event of debt prepayment or early termination of the lease 
base rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective lease agreements 
differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged  as applicable  to rent receivable 
the amount of straight line rent receivable is charged against income upon early termination of a lease or as a reduction of gain on sale of the property 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments  which results in a reduction to income 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual tenant receivables considering the tenant s financial condition  security deposits  letters of credit  lease guarantees and current economic conditions

liquidity and capital resources the company expects to fund the cost of acquisitions  capital expenditures  costs associated with lease renewals and reletting of space  repayment of indebtedness  share repurchases  and development of properties from i cash flow from operations  ii borrowings under the credit facility and  if available  other indebtedness which may include indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  and iii the sale of certain real estate investments 
the company s capital expenditures were approximately  in and  in these capital expenditures consist primarily of building improvements  tenant improvements  and lease commissions 
the company expects to have capital expenditures of approximately  for the company s cash and cash equivalents increased to  at december   from  at december  this increase is due to  of cash provided from operations  partially offset by  and  used by financing activities and investing activities  respectively 
net cash of  provided by operating activities consisted primarily of  of net income adjusted for non cash items  offset by  used in working capital and other activities 
net cash used in working capital and other activities resulted from expenditures incurred by the company in acquiring other assets and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in other liabilities 
net cash of  used for investing activities consisted of cash used for investments in real estate of  offset by net proceeds from sales of real estate investments of  cash used for investments in real estate of  consists of  in developments costs  and  of investments in existing properties 
net cash used by financing activities of  consisted of repayments of bank borrowings and mortgage loans of  payment of dividends and distributions of  the repurchase of  shares of stock for  and the redemption of  shares of op units for  offset by net proceeds from bank borrowings and mortgage loans of  and net proceeds from stock options exercised by employees and directors of  the company s ability to continue to finance its operations is subject to several uncertainties 
for example  the company s ability to obtain mortgage loans on income producing property is dependent upon the ability to attract and retain tenants and the economics of the various markets in which the properties are located  as well as the willingness of mortgage lending institutions to make loans secured by real property 
the company s ability to sell real estate investments is partially dependent upon the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at reasonable commercial rates 
in may  the company renewed its revolving credit facility with a bank group led by bank of america 
the facility  which matures on june   consists of a million secured line with an accordion feature which allows the company at its option to expand the facility to million  if needed 
interest on the facility is at a floating rate equal to either the lender s published reference rate or libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on the company s leverage level 
as of december   the facility had an outstanding balance of  and an effective interest rate of 
in august  the company obtained million of mortgage financing from washington mutual bank 
the loan has a year term and bears interest at a floating rate of a trailing one year treasury rate plus an effective rate of as of december  
the trailing one year treasury rate  which is calculated by averaging the previous twelve months rates  is adjusted every six months with a minimum and maximum change over the previous six month rate 
proceeds from the loan were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of the million line of credit 
in november  the company obtained  of new first mortgage financing from union bank of california 
the financing  a renewal of an existing mortgage with the same lender  consists of a three year loan  bearing interest at a floating rate of libor plus an effective rate of as of december  
the old loan  which had an outstanding balance of approximately million and a maturity date of january   carried a fixed interest of 
the  mortgage is collaterized by the same property pool as the expiring loan  namely nine properties located in california 
proceeds of the new mortgage loan were used to pay off the expiring mortgage and to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of the company s credit facility 
the company was in compliance with the covenants and requirements of its various debt financings during the year ended december  the company anticipates that the cash flow generated by its real estate investments and funds available under the above credit facility will be sufficient to meet its short term liquidity requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands amount of commitment expiring by period less than over year years years years total bank loan payable   mortgage loans payable      construction contract commitments   standby letters of credit   total      related party transactions the company s activities relating to the acquisition of new properties  sales of company owned real estate  development of real property  and financing arrangements are currently performed by bedford acquisitions  inc  bai  a corporation wholly owned by peter bedford  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the company uses the services of bai for its acquisition  disposition  financing and development activities because the company incurs expenses related only to those transactions which are successfully completed rather than incurring expenses related to unsuccessful efforts and associated overhead costs 
these services have been provided pursuant to written contracts renewable annually since january   which provide that bai is obligated to provide services to the company with respect to the company s acquisition  disposition  financing and development activities  and that bai is responsible for the payment of expenses incurred in connection therewith 
bai must submit to the company a cost estimate for the company s approval relating to each activity  setting forth the estimated timing and amount of all projected bai costs relating to such activities 
pursuant to the contract  mr 
bedford is obligated to pay bai s expenses described above if bai fails to make any such payments in a timely fashion  provided that mr 
bedford is not obligated to pay any such amounts exceeding million or following a termination of bai s obligations based on the expiration or termination of the term of the contract 
this arrangement provides that bai earns a success fee in an amount equal to of the purchase price of property acquisitions  of the sale price of dispositions  up to of the amount of any loans less third party commissions  and of the development costs 
the total amount of such fees payable to bai by the company is limited to the lesser of i the aggregate amount of such fees earned  or ii the aggregate amount of approved expenses incurred by bai through the time of such acquisition  disposition  financing or development 
the current agreement with bai has a one year term expiring december   which is automatically extended for an additional term of one year unless either party gives notice of its interest to terminate the agreement by october  for the years ended december    and  the company paid bai an aggregate amount of approximately   and  respectively  for acquisition  disposition  financing  and development activities performed pursuant to the foregoing arrangements 
as of december  and  the company had an accrued liability of  and  respectively  for fees earned by bai in excess of amounts paid to bai by the company under the agreement 
the company believes that since the fees charged under the foregoing arrangements i are comparable to those charged by other real estate service entities or other third party service providers under similar arrangements and ii are charged only for services on successful acquisitions  dispositions  financings and developed properties  such fees are properly includable as costs of acquisitions or dispositions or as capitalized costs of financings and developed properties 
if the company were to discontinue this arrangement it would first look to other service providers to meet most if not all of these services 
there is no assurance that the same level of quality and cost effectiveness would be achieved 
additionally  the company would likely incur additional internal costs to administer such services 
if acceptable service providers were not available for all or a part of these services  the company would evaluate its needs under circumstances existing at that time and consider additions to its staff to meet such requirements 
if such services were performed internally  pre acquisition costs associated with operating properties and costs associated with any unsuccessful efforts related to new borrowings would be expensed 
if service levels comparable to those required in   and were performed internally at the same expense levels incurred by bai  the company estimates that   and  could have been expensed in those periods rather than capitalized and amortized against future periods in the form of depreciation and amortization 
had such amounts been expensed in those periods  diluted earnings per share would have been  and less than corresponding amounts actually reported in   and  respectively 
at december  and  the company did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include the following economic environment both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which the company owns  manages and develops properties have been and continue to be in a recession 
the early indicators of how this affects the real estate industry in general  and the company in particular  are slightly reduced occupancy rates  flattening of growth in market rental rates  and reduced activity levels in the flow of prospective tenants for space currently available for lease 
the company s property types and locations provide some degree of risk diversification but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which the company operates 
although the company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead  it is possible that further reductions in occupancy rates and the absence of rental rate growth  or even reductions in market rental rates  will result in reduction of rental revenues  operating income  cash flows  and the market value of the company s shares 
prolonged recession could also affect the company s ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices 
these conditions and those that follow and many other factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be markedly outside of the company s current expectations 
interest rate fluctuations at the present time  borrowings under the company s credit facility  the million and million mortgage loans from union bank  the million mortgage loans from security life of denver insurance company  and the million mortgage loan from washington mutual bear interest at floating rates 
the floating interest rate on the million mortgage loans has been fixed for a period of one year with interest swap agreements which expire on july  the libor rate on the million mortgage loan has been fixed for a period of one year 
its effective interest rate of expires on december  the company recognizes that its results from operations may be negatively impacted by future increases in interest rates and substantial additional borrowings to finance property acquisitions  development projects and share repurchases 
lease renewals while the company historically has been successful in renewing and reletting space  the company is subject to the risk that certain leases expiring in and beyond may not be renewed  or the terms of renewal may be less favorable to the company than current lease terms 
the company expects to incur costs in making improvements or repairs to its portfolio of properties required by new or renewing tenants and expects to incur expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the reletting of space 
inflation most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation  including escalations in electricity costs in california and neighboring states  however  could result in an increase in the company s borrowing and other operating expenses 
government regulations the company s properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements such as local building codes and other similar regulations 
the company believes its properties are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements  although expenditures at its properties may be required to comply with changes in these laws 
no material expenditures are contemplated at this time in order to comply with any such laws or regulations 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances released on  above  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of such removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances  and the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non compliance or other claim in connection with any of its present or former properties 
accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that compliance with federal  state and local environmental protection regulations will have any material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that future discoveries or events at the company s properties  or changes to current environmental regulations  will not result in such a material adverse impact 
financial performance management considers funds from operations ffo to be one measure of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo during the three and twelve months ended december  was  and  respectively 
during the same periods in  ffo was  and  respectively 
ffo is used by financial analysts in evaluating reits and can be one measure of a reit s ability to make cash distributions 
presentation of this information provides the reader with an additional measure to compare the performance of reits 
ffo is generally defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  excluding extraordinary items such as gains losses from debt restructurings and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo was computed by the company in accordance with this definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s presentation

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company balances its borrowings between fixed and variable rate debt 
while the company has entered into interest swap agreements to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in thousands fair thereafter total value variable rate libor debt        weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt         weighted average interest rate as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
on june   the company entered into interest swap agreements with united california bank 
the swap agreements allow the company to hedge its exposure to variable interest rates on two mortgages with remaining principal balances totaling  by effectively paying a fixed rate of interest over the term of the swap agreement 
interest rate pay differentials that arise under these swap agreements are recognized in interest expense over the term of the contracts 
these interest rate swap agreements were considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the two mortgages 
the following summarizes the principal value and fair value of the company s interest swap contracts 
the principal value at december  provides an indication of the extent of the company s involvement in these contracts but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rate or market risks dollars in thousands principal fixed contract cumulative approximate liability amount rate maturity cash paid  net at december   july   july  the principal amount is included in the table of qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk as variable rate libor debt and fixed rate debt  as applicable 
represents the approximate amount which the company would have paid as of december  if the swap contracts were terminated 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments in accordance with sfas  the company uses the discounted cash flow method  which requires the use of assumptions about market conditions and risks existing at the balance sheet date 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of market value 
accordingly  estimated fair value is a general approximation of value  and such value may or may not actually be realized
