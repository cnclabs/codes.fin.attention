the company will evaluate acquisition opportunities and may use cash or stock for these acquisitions 
acquisitions have become a more important part of the company s growth strategy and could be substantial  while exploration is becoming less important 
in the event of a substantial acquisition  the company could seek additional debt or equity financing 
for instance  on september   the company announced it has entered into a letter of intent with the principal stockholder of high desert mineral resources inc to purchase of the company s common stock for approximately million shares of royal gold common stock  or million in cash  or a combination of cash and stock

critical accounting policies the preparation of royal gold s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most critical accounting principles are the assumptions regarding future gold prices and estimates of reserves and recoveries of mine operators 
the company relies on the operator s estimates and have found them to be reasonable 
such estimates and assumptions affect the potential impairment of long lived assets and the ability to realize income tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the rate at which depreciation and amortization are charged to earnings 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  however  actual amounts could differ from those based on such estimates and assumptions 
the operator based its reserves on a gold price and the company based its deferred tax asset on a gold pric e 
if the long term gold price is substantially lower  these estimates would need to change and could result in material adverse write offs of assets
