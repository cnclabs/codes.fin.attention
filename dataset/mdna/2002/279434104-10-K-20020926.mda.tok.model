table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of its seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures 
historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and with borrowed funds under the company s million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility 
due to the seasonal demand for the company s products  the company builds inventory during the company s first fiscal quarter in advance of the typically stronger selling periods during the company s second  third and fourth fiscal quarters

the line of credit agreement expires on february  under the revolving credit facility  the company is subject to certain customary restrictive financial requirements 
for all periods presented and as of september   the company is in compliance with all such financial covenants 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  more funds from operating activities are generated in its third and fourth fiscal quarters

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of any statements set forth above which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include such factors as the financial strength and competitive pricing environment of the automotive and motorcycle aftermarket industries  product demand  market acceptance  manufacturing efficiencies  new product development  the success of planned advertising  marketing and promotional campaigns  and other risks identified herein and in other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt which may be outstanding from time to time under the company s revolving credit facility with bank of america  nt sa 
the company s revolving credit facility is an million line of credit with an interest rate based on the bank s prime rate currently 
it expires on february  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  the company s cash flow may be affected by increases in the prime rate 
management does not  however  believe that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on the company 
as of fiscal year ended june  and as of september   the company s outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was zero 
even if the company were to draw down on the line prior to its expiration and an unpredicted increase in the prime rate occurred  it would not be likely to have a material effect
