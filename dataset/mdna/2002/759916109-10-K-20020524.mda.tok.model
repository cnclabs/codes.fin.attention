item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this report  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to us are included to identify forward looking statements 
repligen s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements and are a result of certain factors  including those set forth under certain factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
we are developing innovative therapeutic products for debilitating pediatric diseases 
our therapeutic product candidates are secretin for autism  uridine for mitochondrial disease and ctla ig for immune disorders 
these products are synthetic forms of naturally occurring substances which may correct improperly regulated biological processes with minimal toxicity or side effects 
our product candidates have the potential to produce clinical benefits not attainable with any existing drug in diseases for which there are few alternatives 
autism is a developmental disorder characterized by poor communicative and social skills  repetitive and repetitive behaviors and in some patients  gastrointestinal problems 
we have initiated two randomized  placebo controlled  double blind phase clinical trials to evaluate the impact of secretin on the social interaction deficits of autism in children to years of age 
each child will receive six doses of secretin or a placebo over weeks and be evaluated with the social interaction scale of the autism diagnostic observation schedule and with a clinical global impression of change 
in february  we were issued a broad us patent covering the use of secretin in the treatment of autism 
we are currently prosecuting additional patent applications in the united states  europe and japan 
there are currently no drugs approved by the fda for the treatment of autism 
in december  the company licensed from the university of california  san diego ucsd exclusive rights to a us patent application covering novel methods for the treatment of mitochondrial disease 
mitochondria are small bodies found in every cell  which produce energy for cellular processes 
mitochondrial diseases are characterized by impaired function of many systems and organs  particularly skeletal muscles weakness  poor motor skills  the nervous system seizures  poor cognition and dysfunction of the heart and kidney 
uridine is a naturally occurring substance required by all cells for the synthesis of rna  dna and other essential factors 
mitochondria are the only cellular non dietary source of uridine and its synthesis is often impaired in patients with mitochondrial disease 
in a phase study at ucsd  daily administration of uridine or a derivative of uridine was well tolerated by the patients and produced symptom improvements in some patients 
we are currently conducting a placebo controlled phase clinical trial to extend these observations 
for more information on our intellectual property rights to uridine and related compound for the treatment of mitochondrial disease  please see legal proceedings 
we are currently conducting a phase clinical trial of ctla ig in patients with refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura itp 
itp is an autoimmune disease in which the patient s immune system mounts an attack on their own blood platelets which can result in internal bleeding 
in march  we received a notice of allowance from the us patent and trademark office for the specific ctla ig composition which we are developing 
repligen has also obtained an exclusive license to the patent rights of the university of michigan which pertain to ctla ig and is prosecuting patents filed by the university related to therapeutic uses of ctla ig 
we also believe that the university of michigan and repligen are entitled to rights to certain us patents on compositions and therapeutic uses of ctla which have been issued to bristol myers squibb company 
for more information on our intellectual property rights to ctla ig  please see legal proceedings 
in october  we licensed exclusive commercial rights to two diagnostic products based on synthetic forms of porcine pig derived and human secretin from a private company 
both of these products have been evaluated in clinical trials for their safety and efficacy in diagnosing pancreatic function and gastrinoma 
in april  the fda approved the use of synthetic porcine secretin secreflo tm to aid in the assessment of pancreatic function and the diagnosis of gastrinoma  a form of cancer 
the fda has granted secreflo tm orphan drug designation  which means that we will have a seven year period of exclusivity to market the product in the us in december of  the fda issued an approvable letter for a synthetic form of human secretin which contained questions concerning the manufacture and quality control of the product 
prior to approval  chirhoclin will need to provide additional information to the fda to satisfy the fda s concerns 
the fda has granted this product orphan drug status which means we will have a seven year period of exclusivity following final approval to market this product 
we intend to market these diagnostic products directly to gastroenterologists in the us we develop  manufacture and market products for the production of therapeutic antibodies 
we currently market a line of products for the purification of antibodies based on a naturally occurring protein  protein a  which can specifically bind to antibodies 
repligen owns composition of matter patents for recombinant protein a in the united states which expire in in december  we entered into a ten year agreement to supply recombinant protein a to amersham pharmacia biotech  a leading supplier to the biopharmaceutical market 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supersedes certain aspects of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb 
in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the provisions of this statement are required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company does not expect the impact of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that reporting companies discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of this and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
the company s preparation of this annual report on form k requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements  and assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we generate product revenues from the sale of our protein a products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries 
we recognize revenue related to product sales upon shipment of the product to the customer 
licensing and royalties from our licensed technologies are recognized as earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab requires companies to recognize certain upfront nonrefundable fees over the life of the related alliance when such fees are received in conjunction with alliances that have multiple elements 
clinical trial estimates our clinical development trials related to our proprietary drug products are primarily performed by outside parties 
it is not unusual at the end of each accounting period to estimate both the total cost of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
we then need to adjust our estimates when final invoices are received 
to date  these adjustments have not been material to our financial statements  and we believe that the estimates that we made as of march  are reflective of the actual expenses incurred as of that date 
however  readers should be cautioned that the possibility exists that the timing or cost of certain trials might be longer or shorter or cost more or less than we have estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase in revenue is a result of increased protein a sales driven predominantly by the rapid market growth and success of antibody therapeutic drugs 
product revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is due to increased product shipments to amersham and increased demand from several monoclonal antibody producers during the year 
research and development revenues for fiscal were compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or

selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to increases in payroll and related expenses  and litigation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in non cash charges related to the issuance of warrants that were incurred during fiscal cost of product sold for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is largely attributable to increased protein a sales and to mix of product sales partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies 
gross margin for our product revenue in fiscal was of product revenues versus of product revenue for fiscal this increase is a result of changes in product mix and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
investment income investment income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is attributable to lower average funds available for investment and lower interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
we do  however  expect our cash balance to decline during fiscal and expect that our interest income will also decrease 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease in revenue is a result of the discontinuance of research collaborations and grants programs that occurred during fiscal as we focused our efforts on our own proprietary drug programs 
product revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
product sales under our supply agreement with amersham increased during fiscal partially offset by a decrease in sales of our protein a product as a result of the timing of large production scale orders

selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
during fiscal increases in payroll and related expenses  non cash charges related to the issuance of warrants  and increased shareholder communication expenses were partially offset by an early termination fee received in fiscal from a tenant and a decrease in financial advisory costs that were incurred during fiscal cost of product sold for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
gross margin for our product revenue in fiscal was of product revenues versus of product revenues for fiscal this decrease is a result of increased personnel costs and production costs relating to the amersham supply agreement 
investment income investment income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in investment income is due to higher average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as result of the common stock financings that took place during march liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and revenues derived from product sales  collaborative research agreements  government grants  and payments received from licensing and royalty agreements 
at march  we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  our operating activities in used cash of approximately  consisting of the net loss from operations for the year and increases in inventory  accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
these cash uses were offset by noncash charges for depreciation and amortization and an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable 
during fiscal  we purchased  of capital equipment  consisting of laboratory and office equipment 
we have leased  pursuant to a ten year lease agreement  a new corporate headquarters in waltham  massachusetts 
we expect to expend approximately  for leasehold improvements for this  square foot facility 
we incurred costs of  associated with our new facility in waltham during fiscal we anticipate that this new facility will increase operating efficiencies and manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand for our protein a products  and to better meet corporate goals and objectives 
we plan to relocate to these new facilities in the first quarter of in connection with this lease agreement  a letter of credit in the amount of  was issued to the company s landlord 
the letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit held by the bank that issued the letter of credit 
the certificate of deposit is included in restricted cash in the accompanying balance sheet as of march  in fiscal  we received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
we expect to incur significantly higher costs in fiscal as a result of expanded research and development costs associated with the expansion of activities associated with clinical trials of our proprietary drug candidates and the launch of our diagnostic product  secreflo tm 
during april and as required by the terms of our license agreement with chirhoclin  we paid a milestone payment of  in connection with the fda s approval of secreflo  our synthetic porcine secretin product 
also pursuant to such license agreement  we are required to issue to chirhoclin approximately   shares of our common stock no later than the end of the second quarter of fiscal we have not granted registration rights to chirhoclin with respect to the shares to be issued under the license agreement 
in addition  under terms of licensing agreement with chirhoclin  if the fda approves the nda for human secretin diagnostic  we will be required to pay chirhoclin future milestones in cash 
we will be required to pay royalties on sales of both synthetic porcine and human products 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twenty four months 
should we need to secure additional financing to meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates  beginning in  if not used 
net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders
