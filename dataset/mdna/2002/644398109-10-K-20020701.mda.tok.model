deferred taxes fas  accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  the separate recognition  measured at currently enacted tax rates  of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes

million for each respective year

critical accounting policies new frontier media s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  goodwill impairment  and prepaid distribution rights content licensing 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues for the subscription ppv tv group are primarily related to the sale of our network services to cable dbs affiliates 
the cable affiliates do not report actual monthly sales for each of their systems to the subscription ppv tv group until days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the subscription ppv tv group s historical experience for each affiliated system 
revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt by the subscription ppv tv group 
adjustments made to adjust revenue from estimated to actual have historically been immaterial 
the recognition of revenues for both the subscription ppv tv and internet groups is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for both the subscription ppv tv and internet groups 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event new frontier media were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should new frontier media determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain a reserve for chargebacks and credits for estimated refunds related to customers whose transactions were processed via credit cards for both the subscription ppv tv and internet groups 
should our actual chargebacks and credits be higher than estimated we would have an additional expense for the period in which this was experienced 
goodwill impairment our long lived assets include goodwill in the amount of million as of march  related to the subscription ppv tv group 
during  we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which generally required us to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of these assets 
no impairment losses were recorded related to goodwill during we are adopting sfas effective april  we have not yet determined the amount of the impairment loss but expect to complete that measurement by june  any further impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
prepaid distribution rights the company s subscription ppv group s film and content library consists of newly produced and historical film licensing agreements 
the company accounts for the licenses in accordance with fas financial accounting by broadcasters 
accordingly  the company capitalizes the costs associated with the licenses and amortizes the costs on a straight line basis over the life of the licensing agreement usually to years 
pursuant to fas the costs associated with the license agreements should be amortized based on the relative revenues earned for each showing of the film 
management has determined that it is appropriate to amortize these costs on a straight line basis under the assertion that each showing of the film is expected to generate similar revenues 
the company regularly reviews and evaluates the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis and assesses if an accelerated method would more appropriately reflect the revenue generation of the content 
through its analysis  management has concluded that the current policy of recognizing the costs incurred to license the film library on a straight line basis most accurately reflects the revenue generated by each showing of the film 
management periodically reviews the film library and assesses if the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the films 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film library  the company will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value of the film library to the fair market value

interest rate risk 
as of june   the company had cash in checking and money market accounts 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these assets 
furthermore  the company s borrowings are at fixed interest rates  limiting the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not have any foreign currency exposure because it currently does not transact business in foreign currencies
