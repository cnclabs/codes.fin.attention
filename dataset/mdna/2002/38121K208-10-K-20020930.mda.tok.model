significant accounting policies critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to its revenue recognition policy  the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  and the valuation of its long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
some of our significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies 
the policies described below have been identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition sales of bulk wine  juice and brandy are recognized at the time the product specifications of the purchase contract are met and the product has been accepted by the buyer  title has passed to the buyer  and there is no right of return in the contract 
in certain cases the contract requirements specify that we store such product after it has been sold and require the buyer to pay a storage fee 
sales of wine grapes and cased goods are recognized at the time of delivery to the customer 
wine processing and storage fees are recognized as those services are provided 
trade receivables substantially all accounts receivable are due from wine distributors and major wineries located in california 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral for its sales 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect expected credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments on such accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of the customer accounts receivable and the credit worthiness of each customer 
furthermore  these judgments must be continually updated and evaluated 
estimates of potential losses are based on historical as well as current data  including the aging of the receivables  recent bankruptcy trends  delinquency rates  historical charge off patterns  recovery rates and other data 
other factors  including the general economic environment in the wine industry  are also considered 
historically  our credit losses on receivables have been consistent and within expectations 
however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  adjustment to those estimates may be required 
inventories bulk wine  case goods and brandy are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value 
inventories of supplies are stated at the lower of the first in  first out method or market 
costs associated withe the current year s unharvested grape crop are deferred and recognized in the subsequent year when the grapes are harvested 
wine inventories are classified as current assets in accordance with recognized trade practice although some products will not be sold in the following year 
effective july   we changed our wine and brandy inventory costing method from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about historical usage  future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  assets held for sale and other assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
with respect to vineyards  we perform an evaluation of whether an impairment charge should be made whenever particular vineyards experience unfavorable operating results 
a vineyard s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows over its estimated life to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the discounted future cash flows of the vineyard is recognized 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a variety of factors  including historical experience with yields and expected grape sales prices 
various uncertainties  including but not limited to bad weather  pests and diseases  and excess inventory levels in the industry could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by a vineyard 
in fiscal  we recognized an impairment reserve of approximately million to reflect the anticipated loss on the sale of lost hills vineyard currently in escrow 
this loss was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent note payable to a related party of million 
in june the company s board of directors approved a plan to sell certain excess assets 
these assets  which include a bulk wine and bottling facility  a warehouse  a tasting room and certain vineyards  are included in the accompanying financial statements as assets held for sale 
we expect that proceeds from the sale of the excess assets will be used for debt reduction and or operating purposes 
if actual performances of the remaining vineyards are less favorable than our projections  future asset impairment charges may be necessary 
similar procedures are used when analyzing other corporate assets for impairment 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that they would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
recent developments our bulk wine business unit continues to experience downward pressure on sales volumes and margins 
this is a result of continued softness in the wine industry due to surplus domestic and international bulk wine inventories and a reduction in the number of long term bulk wine sales contracts relative to previous years 
as a result  the company s bulk wine inventory at june  is million greater than at june  and substantially in excess of committed sales contracts 
although management believes that this excess inventory can be sold on the spot market at sales prices at or above the carrying value  no assurance can be given that the company will not experience losses on the sale or disposition of a portion of the inventory  and such losses could be material 
the company has recorded an inventory lower of cost or market reserve of approximately million as of june  based on management s current assessment of market conditions 
in our march  form q  we reported that we were notified by a significant customer that they are reducing their requirements by approximately two thirds for custom processing  storage and barreling services relative to the crush 
revenues attributable to this customer for the year ended june  were approximately million or of bulk wine segment revenues 
we have negotiated replacement contracts and contract buy outs with this customer to attempt to cover this anticipated revenue shortfall 
our new ready to drink rtd bottling unit did not meet our originally anticipated profit levels for the year due to lower than expected customer demand  higher than expected start up costs  unplanned capital expenditures and expenditures to maximize bottling line throughput 
furthermore  the largest of our three rtd customers exercised a contract provision providing for termination of the contract within a specified number of months 
a termination agreement to buy out the remaining contract production requirement was entered into in august the agreement requires this customer to pay approximately million to us in lieu of providing further production services 
revenues for the year ended june  related to this contract were approximately million or of case goods segment revenues 
based on the termination of the contract  management is actively pursuing alternate customer relationships 
we have been in the process of implementing a new enterprise wide technology platform over the past two years 
in january  we implemented all of the modules of the system with the exception of the bulk wine module 
due to significant remaining programming and training costs and additional ongoing resources needed to operate the bulk wine module  we have elected not to implement the bulk wine module 
accordingly  in fiscal the company has written off approximately million included in selling  general and administrative expense of such costs 
on july   the company renewed its revolving line of credit to provide million through february  and million thereafter with variable interest based on interest rate options elected by the company 
we completed the sale of approximately acres of our vineyards located in fresno county 
we recorded a gain of approximately million on this sale as an offset to wine grape cost of sales 
the property collateralized long term debt and the lender required the proceeds of million to be applied to the loan principal and to a prepayment penalty of  in august  the company entered into an agreement to sell the entire lost hills vineyard 
an asset impairment reserve was recognized of approximately million included in wine grape cost of sales in fiscal to reflect the anticipated loss on this sale 
this loss was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent note payable to a related party of approximately million 
in september  greg j 
forrest and peter w 
mullin resigned as directors of the company 
the board has appointed david gale as a new director of the company  effective september  mark a 
larson  the company s president and chief operating officer  departed the company effective may  the company and mr 
larson have finalized severance arrangements including a payment representing one year s salary or  in june mr 
larson had options to purchase approximately  shares of stock but such options reverted back to the stock option plan upon expiration in august management believes that it has sufficient executive management personnel to direct its current business volume 
in light of the foregoing developments  the company is currently reducing its cost structure and increasing operating efficiencies including labor reductions in june  july and august approximately positions primarily involved in plant operations were eliminated during this period 
the table below sets forth summary statement of operations data for the three fiscal years ended june  in fiscal  the company changed its wine and brandy inventory costing method from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method and all prior years have been restated to give effect for that change summary statement of operations data in thousands year ended june  revenues    cost of sales    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    write down on systems cost  income loss from operations    interest expense    income loss before income taxes    income taxes    net income loss    the following table reflects summary statement of operations data shown above  expressed as a percentage of revenues percentage of revenues year ended june  revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses write down on systems cost income loss from operations interest expense income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss seasonality and quarterly results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
because of the inherent seasonality of our operations  we have historically reported our highest revenues and net income in our second fiscal quarter as we sell most of our bulk wine in the second quarter  immediately after crush  and perform many of our wine processing services in the first and second quarters 
as a result  we typically report lower revenues and net income loss in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in the current fiscal year  we have experienced decreased bulk wine revenues as a result of a reduced number of long term bulk wine sales contracts relative to previous years 
we believe such decrease in long term bulk sales contracts is attributable to plantings of new vineyards current and anticipated lower bulk wine market prices higher levels of wine inventory held by our customers and increased international competition 
we anticipate that these market pressures will continue

bulk wine and related services 
for fiscal  revenues from bulk wine and related services were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to revenues of million in the period to period decrease was a result of a reduction of bulk wine contract and spot sales of approximately million gallons or approximately million at lower average sales prices per gallon totalling approximately million partially offset by approximately million in increased bulk wine storage revenues 
wine grapes 
in fiscal  revenues from grape sales were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to revenues of million in fiscal wine grape revenues include sales of grapes grown on the company s vineyards and grapes purchased from outside growers and resold to various third parties or resold grapes 
the decline in this segment s revenues is due to reduced volume of wine grapes sold of approximately million  partially offset by price increases totalling approximately million 
the reduction in sales of company grown grapes is consistent with our plan to use more company grown grapes in our operations 
resold grape volume decreases totalled approximately million partially offset by increased prices totalling approximately million 
case goods and related services 
for fiscal  revenues from case goods and related services were million  an increase of million or  as compared to revenues of million in fiscal the increase is a result of revenues recognized on custom bottling services for malt based alcoholic beverages of million in fiscal malt based alcoholic beverage custom bottling services commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal brandy 
for fiscal  revenues from the sale of brandy and grape spirits were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to revenues of million for fiscal the period to period decrease in brandy revenue was due to decreased proof gallons sold or approximately million at reduced contracted prices with an effect of approximately million 
cost of sales 
for fiscal  total cost of sales was million  a decrease of or  from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales for fiscal was  an increase from for fiscal the increase in cost of sales on a percentage of revenue basis was a result of various vineyard transactions as follows in august  the company entered into an agreement to sell the entire lost hills vineyard comprising approximately acres 
an asset impairment reserve was recognized of approximately million included in wine grape costs of sales in fiscal to reflect the anticipated loss on this sale 
this loss was partially offset by a reversal of a note payable to a related party of approximately million  in spring  the company began removal of approximately acres of underperforming vineyards resulting in a million charge  together partially offset by in spring  the company sold approximately acres of vineyards located in fresno county realizing a gain of approximately million 
another factor impacting the increased percentage of cost of sales to revenues was reduced pricing per proof gallon of brandy sold 
partially offsetting factors include the decreased grape cost component of bulk wine and case goods costs relative to sales prices 
gross profit in fiscal  we realized gross profit of million  a decrease of million or  as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  gross profit for fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal  for reasons discussed above under cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of million or  from million in fiscal the period to period increase was due to increased payroll and related expenses including certain severance expenses and post production service and support of our new enterprise wide technology platform partially offset by elimination of accrued bonuses in the current year 
write down on system cost in fiscal  a write off of million was recorded related to the bulk wine module of our new enterprise wide technology platform 
management elected not to implement the bulk wine module due to significant remaining programming and training costs and additional ongoing resources needed to operate the bulk wine module 
we will continue to use our existing bulk wine tracking software which is adequate for our current needs 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense was million  an increase of million or  as compared to interest expense of million in fiscal the period to period increase resulted from increased average borrowings on our line of credit and long term debt and decreased interest capitalized related to an increased average balance of capital projects in progress partially offset by lower overall interest rates 
in addition  approximately  of prepayment penalties were incurred in fiscal due to lender requirement to pay down long term debt with proceeds on sale of certain vineyards located in fresno county 
interest capitalized in fiscal and was approximately and million  respectively 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate of our income tax benefit was for fiscal as compared to our income tax rate of for fiscal the income tax benefit effective rate for fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in manufacturing tax credits 
net income loss for fiscal  net loss was million  a decrease of million  as compared to net income of million in fiscal net loss for fiscal was impacted by factors covered above 
earnings loss per share for fiscal  diluted loss per share was compared to diluted earnings per share of for fiscal fiscal years ended june  and revenues total revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or  as compared to revenues of million in fiscal the overall slight increase in revenues was primarily due to increased revenues in the bulk wine and case goods segments largely offset by decreased wine grape sales resulting from the planned reduction in sales of company grown grapes and from decreased volume of resold grapes  both at lower prices as compared to the prior year 
bulk wine and related services 
for fiscal  revenues from bulk wine and related services were million  an increase of million or  as compared to million during fiscal increased custom processing volumes and bulk wine volumes resulted in million increased revenues partially offset by lower pricing on bulk wine sales of approximately million during fiscal wine grapes 
in fiscal  revenues from wine grape sales were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to revenues of million for fiscal revenues from company grown grapes decreased approximately million or from approximately million for fiscal year to million for fiscal  consistent with the company s plan to use more company grown grapes in its operations 
the decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower unit prices realized in fiscal resold grape revenue decreased to million from million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in resold grape revenue resulted from lower volume and lower unit pricing realized in fiscal case goods and related services 
for fiscal  revenues from case goods and related services were million  an increase of million or  as compared to revenues of million for the first nine months of fiscal the period to period increase in case goods and related services revenues was due to increased volume in international case goods sales of million and increased prices on international sales of million 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company commenced custom bottling services for malt based alcoholic beverages on its million high speed bottling line 
revenues related to such production were approximately 
million in fiscal initial production levels were not at peak capacity 
the company expects production levels and related revenues to increase in fiscal brandy 
for fiscal  revenues from the sale of brandy and grape spirits were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to revenues of million in fiscal the decrease in brandy revenues in fiscal is primarily due to lower unit pricing stemming from the lower cost of brandy grapes used in production in fiscal of approximately million  partially offset by increased volume in fiscal totalling approximately million 
cost of sales 
for fiscal  total cost of sales was million  a decrease of million or  from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales for fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales on a percentage of revenue basis was primarily the result of higher margins on bulk wine sales favorably impacted by lower grape costs which were partially offset by lower unit pricing 
in addition  vineyard removal costs decreased from million to million from fiscal to fiscal respectively 
case goods cost of sales were negatively impacted by additional costs associated with integrating new bottling activity into the company s historical bottling programs  and by write offs of certain dry goods and packaged products 
gross profit in fiscal  the company realized gross profit of million  an increase of million or  as compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  gross profit for fiscal was  an increase from for fiscal the company s gross profit and gross margin for fiscal were the result of items discussed above under cost of sales

the charge includes preliminary engineering costs incurred and estimated losses on the resale of such equipment 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense was million  a decrease of million or  as compared to million in fiscal the period to period decline is primarily due to decreased weighted average borrowings on the company s line of credit and long term debt and increased capitalized interest relative to increased capital expenditures

net income for fiscal  net income was million  a decrease of million or  as compared to net income of million in fiscal net income was impacted by factors discussed above 
earnings per share for fiscal  diluted earnings per share was compared to diluted earnings per share of for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our working capital position at june  was million  compared to million at june  the decrease in working capital is due to cash expenditures funded with short term debt 
historically  our investments in receivables and inventories are at their highest in the second quarter and are reduced in the third and fourth quarters  however  investments in inventories remain high due to current difficult market conditions 
we maintain a revolving line of credit for working capital purposes which is secured by inventory  accounts receivable  the current year s wine grape crop and other collateral 
borrowings under the line typically peak in november  during our second fiscal quarter 
the revolving line of credit balance was million at june   with no outstanding balance at june  unused availability under the line of credit was million at june  on july   we renewed the revolving bank line of credit to provide million through february  and million thereafter 
the line expires july  and we intend and expect to renew the line at that time 
the company s revolving line of credit and long term debt financing agreements contain certain financial covenants 
as a result of the factors discussed above under recent development  the company was not in compliance with cash flow and working capital minimum requirements of its bank credit agreement as of june   but a waiver was subsequently obtained in september these financial ratios are measured only at june of each fiscal year 
in addition  the company was not in compliance with a fixed charge coverage requirement of its insurance company loan agreement as of june   but a waiver was subsequently obtained in september as well as an amendment to the loan agreement regarding this covenant effective for each quarter beginning september  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to net cash provided by operations of million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operations resulted from reduced income and increased inventories 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal we have funded these expenditures in from our working capital line 
we intend to partially refinance these expenditures and finance future capital expenditures through long term financing arrangements 
because we successfully renewed and increased our existing line of credit  we believe operating and working capital line sources are adequate for our current operating needs as well as our capital expenditure program 
we have classified a bulk wine facility  a warehouse  a tasting room and certain vineyards with a net book value of million net of impairment charge of million as assets held for sale at june  proceeds from the sale of these assets will be used for operating purposes and or debt reduction 
in october  a principal payment of million plus interest is due on a note payable to an insurance company 
vineyards included in assets held for sale collateralize this note 
we intend to pay off the note with proceeds from this sale 
we are negotiating with the lender to extend the maturity should a sale not occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we can choose from several variable rate options on certain of our debt 
all of our balance sheet items and sales are in us dollars  therefore we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these financial data 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
certain of our debt is subject to variable interest rate options 
the following chart indicates our fixed and variable rate long and short term debt at june   and estimates the balances of such debt in future periods millions june  bank line of credit variable rate average outstanding weighted average rate per period long term debt fixed rate average outstanding weighted average rate per period based on current anticipated cash flow  we believe that our bank line of credit will be periodically used to fund operations in our peak season 
during our annual business cycle  we utilize a variable interest rate working capital line at various borrowing levels 
our existing working capital loan agreement offers interest rate options at spreads over libor and or lender cost of funds  at maturities we selected 
for fiscal  the average outstanding balance under this line was approximately million  with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
at june   the balance on our fixed rate long term debt was million and carried a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the weighted average interest rate for fiscal for all our debt was approximately 
for strategic reasons  we enter into forward product sales and material supply contracts  most of which have staggered maturity dates 
under sfas and the corresponding amendments under sfas  these contracts qualify as normal sales and purchases contracts  under which we expect to take physical delivery 
of our four primary lines of business  bulk wine  grape sales and brandy production are subject to multi year contracts  while case goods sales occur on a short term basis 
the primary raw material component for most of our products is wine grapes 
we enter into long and short term grape purchase contracts to ensure an adequate and cost effective source of raw material for production 
we currently have several contracts to purchase grapes at costs anticipated to exceed market for the crush 
we are in the process of renegotiating such contracts but no assurance can be given that such efforts will be successful 
product sales contracts are substantially fixed over the term of the contract as to quantity and price 
wine grape contract terms are similarly fixed at inception for the term of the contract  although a portion of these contracts contains annual harvest market price adjustment clauses  including individual harvest year minimum pricing 
for fiscal  or the harvest year  none of our total wine grape purchases on a dollar basis were adjusted upward against contract minimum prices following the harvest 
a certain portion of our annual wine and brandy production is committed under sales contracts 
we maintain a certain amount of uncommitted product inventory to meet customer demand 
bulk wine sold under long term contracts decreased from million gallons in fiscal to million gallons in fiscal at june   our reported inventory value of bulk wine and brandy was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  is committed to sales contracts 
uncommitted inventory of approximately million  or is reserved for future case goods sales and for spot market bulk wine sales 
we generally match preproduction contractual sales with contracted material supply agreements and will continue to maintain certain uncommitted inventory
