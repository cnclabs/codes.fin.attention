overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objectives are to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are backed by leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds or others  with a particular emphasis on senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we may acquire existing loans that meet this profile from leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds and others 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we seek out small and medium sized businesses that meet certain criteria  including the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering by the borrower or by exercise of our right to require the borrower to buy back its warrants 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
our loans typically range from million to million  mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at a fixed or variable rate that exceeds the prime rate 
a number of our loans have a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind or pik interest  and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
because our loans will generally be subordinated debt of private companies who typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were in fact rated  and therefore we cannot determine whether or not they could be considered to be investment grade quality 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
in addition  as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
we provide these services  for which we receive fees  through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone advisers  inc such fees are typically paid in part at the time a prospective portfolio company signs a non binding term sheet with us  with the remainder paid at the closing of the investments 
these fees are generally non recurring  however in some instances they may have a recurring component 
the specific services we provide vary by portfolio company  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital and providing general financial advice 
we record these fees as managerial assistance fee revenue in the period in which the fees are earned 
our business plan calls for managerial assistance fee revenue to equal or exceed our operating expenses excluding interest expense 
however  during the fiscal year ended september   operating expenses excluding interest expense exceeded managerial assistance fee revenue by approximately million 
because we typically generate managerial assistance fee revenue only when we make new loans  our relatively slow pace of loans during the fiscal year led to this shortfall 
in the future  we will need to make loans at a faster pace in order to meet this objective 
however  we believe that  as the economic environment improves  we will be able to make sufficient new investments so that over time our managerial assistance fee revenue will equal or exceed our operating expenses excluding interest expense  although there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business and reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan 
typically  upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower pays us a non refundable fee for our services rendered through the date of the non binding term sheet 
we recognize this fee as revenue upon execution of the non binding term sheet 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction 
any amounts collected are recognized as other income in the quarter in which such reimbursement is received 
also  in the event that we have incurred significant legal fees in connection with the transaction  we will typically also seek reimbursement for these expenses from the proposed borrower 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements 
the only significant continuing revenue associated with the investments we have already closed is interest paid and  potentially  capital gains received in connection with the liquidation of any associated equity interest eg  warrants 
while in some instances we may also receive on going managerial assistance fee revenue in connection with a consummated investment  any such amounts are insignificant 
the general economic climate during the fiscal year ended september  was unfavorable 
many businesses saw their sales and business prospects decline during the year 
consequently  many of these companies were forced to lay off employees and engage in other cost cutting measures 
as a result of the difficult business climate  we determined it prudent to proceed cautiously in making loans during the fiscal year 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made eleven different loans to  or investments in  eight companies for a total of approximately million including the maximum aggregate amount outstanding under an million line of credit in favor of one of our portfolio companies  that has subsequently been retired 
this was below our objective set at the beginning of the fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  one of our investments  including all amounts outstanding under a million senior term loan and an million senior line of credit  was repaid in full 
in spite of the economic environment  we are earnestly working toward the consummation of more investments 
these prospective loans are subject to  among other things  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of each borrower  acceptance of terms and structure and necessary consents 
with respect to each prospective loan  we will only agree to provide the loan if  among other things  the results of our due diligence investigations are satisfactory  the terms and conditions of the loan are acceptable and all necessary consents are received 
our management has initiated its due diligence investigations of the potential borrowers  however we can not assure you that we will not discover facts in the course of completing our due diligence that would render a particular investment imprudent or that any of these loans will actually be made 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
as disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
we value our investment portfolio each quarter 
members of our senior management prepare the portfolio company valuations using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
these individuals also consult with the respective principal who is managing the portfolio investment relationship to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development  and other operational issues 
the valuations are presented to our board of directors  which reviews and approves the portfolio valuations in accordance with the following valuation policy 
we carry our investments at fair value  as determined by our board of directors 
securities that are publicly traded  if any  are valued at the closing price on the valuation date 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded which  to date  constitutes all of our investments  or for which we have various degrees of trading restrictions  are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
in making such determination  our board of directors will value non convertible debt securities at cost plus amortized original issue discount and pik interest  if any  unless adverse factors lead to a determination of a lesser valuation 
in valuing convertible debt  equity or other securities  our board of directors determines the fair value based on the collateral  the issuer s ability to make payments  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  sales to third parties of similar securities  the comparison to publicly traded securities and other pertinent factors 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
managerial assistance fees the act requires that a business development company make available managerial assistance to its portfolio companies 
we provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with our investments through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone advisers  inc and receive fees for our managerial assistance services 
these fees are normally paid at the closing of our investments in our portfolio companies  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned 
the managerial assistance services we provide vary by investment  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  and providing general financial advice 
from time to time  we are invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction 
in the event that we do not provide significant managerial assistance services in connection with our investment  loan fees paid to us in such situations are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
loan grading and performance we grade all of our loans on a scale from to this system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower s business  the collateral coverage of the loans and other factors we consider relevant 
loan grade loans with a grade of involve the least amount of risk in our portfolio 
the borrower is performing above expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable 
loans graded involve a level of risk that is similar to the risk that existed at the time of our investment 
the borrower is performing as we expected and the risk factors are favorable 
all new loans are initially graded loans graded involve a borrower performing below our expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased since our investment 
the borrower may be out of compliance with debt covenants  however  loan payments are not more than days past due 
for loans graded  our management will increase procedures to monitor the borrower and the fair value generally will be lowered 
a loan grade of indicates that the borrower is performing materially below our expectations and that the loan risk has substantially increased since our investment 
the borrower is out of compliance with some or all of the debt covenants and payments are delinquent 
loans graded are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered 
to date  all portfolio investments are grade and have been since our initial investments 
we will stop accruing interest on an investment when we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
our valuation analysis described above serves as a critical piece of data in this determination 
to date we have not placed any investments on non accrual 
at september   no payments were past due on any of our outstanding loans 
credit statistics we monitor a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
these key statistics include debt to ebitda ratio the sum of all debt with equal or senior security rights to our debt investments divided by the total adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  of the most recent twelve months or  when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
interest coverage ratio the total scheduled cash interest payments required to have been made by the portfolio company during the most recent twelve month period divided by ebitda 
debt service coverage ratio the total scheduled principal amortization and the total scheduled cash interest payments required to have been made during the most recent twelve month period divided by ebitda 
we require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements  we calculate the statistics described above 
for purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies  we may make certain adjustments to ebitda to reflect the pro forma results of a company consistent with a change of control transaction  to reflect anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring  costs related to new product development  compensation to previous owners  and other acquisition or restructuring related items 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal year ended september  to the period from inception may  through september  operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately million as compared to  for the period from inception may  through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year as contrasted to our limited operations during the prior period 
in addition  during the fiscal year  we began investing the proceeds of our initial public offering in debt securities of private companies 
these debt securities provide a higher yield than the short term investment grade securities that represented substantially all of our assets as of september  interest income from our investments in debt securities of private companies was approximately million for the fiscal year ended september   including  of pik interest 
because we did not make any such investments prior to november  we did not record interest income from debt securities of private companies for the period from inception through september  the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately million  as compared to approximately  for the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of our investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering for the full year 
by comparison  the results for the period from inception through september  include interest income earned on the investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering from august  the date of the closing of our initial public offering through september  as we continue to acquire debt securities of private companies  which we anticipate will be at interest rates significantly greater than the rates that we are currently receiving on our deposited cash and cash equivalents  we expect that income from invested cash and cash equivalents will decline as a percentage of total revenue and that interest income from debt securities will increase and become our predominant source of revenue 
for the fiscal year ended september   we recorded approximately  in interest income from loans to our employees in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  as compared to approximately  in interest income from such loans for the period from inception through september  the increase is primarily the result of the inclusion in the results of operations for the year ended september  of a full year of interest income on the majority of such employee loans which were made at the time of our initial public offering and  to a lesser extent  the inclusion of interest income on employee loans entered into during the fiscal year 
by comparison  the results for the period from inception through september  include interest earned on such employee loans from the time of exercise of such options august  through september  managerial assistance fees were approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  fee income for the fiscal year ended september  consists primarily of managerial assistance fees received in connection with investments we closed during the fiscal year 
it also includes approximately  in fees associated with a line of credit we extended to one of our portfolio companies that is no longer outstanding 
because we did not make any investments in debt securities of private companies prior to november  we did not record any managerial assistance fee income for the period from inception through september  other income was approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  this amount was comprised of approximately  in up front fees received in connection with five proposed investments that ultimately were not consummated and approximately  in other fees 
because we did not experience the termination of any such negotiations during the period from inception through september   we did not record any other income for such period 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  compared to approximately  for the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  however  this increase was partially offset by substantial nonrecurring costs associated with the organization of the company and our commencement of operations incurred during the period from inception through september  salaries and benefits for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  as compared to approximately  for the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  salaries and benefits also increased as a result of our hiring additional employees during the year 
we expect salaries and benefits to continue to increase as we hire additional personnel 
general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of insurance  office operations  travel and stockholder related expenses  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  general and administrative expense also increased as a result of the general expansion of our operations during the year 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and audit fees  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  rent expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  this amount also increased as a result of our relocation of our principal executive offices following the completion of our initial public offering 
directors fees for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  we anticipate that annual directors fees will approximate  per non employee director over time 
we believe that our current level of operating expenses is not necessarily indicative of our future operating expenses 
we estimate that over time  as we continue to more fully deploy the proceeds of our initial public offering  our operating expenses will be approximately two percent of our net assets 
net operating income as a result of the operating income and operating expenses described above  we had net operating income of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  based on a weighted average of  basic and  diluted shares outstanding  our net operating income per common share for the fiscal year ended september  was basic and diluted 
for the period from inception through september   we incurred a net operating loss of approximately  based on a weighted average of  shares outstanding  our net operating loss per common share for the period from inception through september  was  basic and diluted 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had investments in debt securities of  or loans to  seven private companies  totaling approximately million of total investment assets 
this number includes approximately  in accrued pik interest  which as described in overview  is added to our carrying value of our investments 
the following table summarizes the contractual principal amortization and maturity of our investment portfolio by fiscal year year amount thereafter  total  cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september   consisting primarily of the items described in results of operations  was approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  the net cash used consisted of investments in our portfolio companies  partially offset by a net increase in cash of approximately million in connection with repurchase agreements and the repayment  by our portfolio companies  of investments in principal amount of approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  and consisted primarily of the payment of dividends of approximately million and the repayment of accrued costs of approximately  associated with our initial public offering 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash and cash equivalents decreased from approximately million at the beginning of the year to approximately million at the end of the year 
this decrease of approximately million was largely the result of our investing activities  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents in connection with the repurchase agreement described below 
on september   we entered into a repurchase agreement with ubs paine webber for approximately million 
the repurchase agreement was fully collateralized by a united states treasury bill with a fair value of approximately million that matured on october  the interest rate on the repurchase agreement was 
this repurchase agreement was reflected on our balance sheet as of september  as an increase in cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors of million  along with a corresponding liability for the same amount 
the repurchase agreement was settled on october  in the future  we plan to use a similar form of repurchase agreement as an investment option or in order to satisfy certain asset diversification requirements and maintain our status as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
in order to qualify as a regulated investment company and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required  under subchapter m of the internal revenue code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of   and per share on our common stock for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  of the fiscal year ended september  aggregate dividends declared and paid for the fiscal year were approximately million 
we declared these dividends based upon our estimate of net operating income for the year 
because of the difficult economic climate during the year  our investment pace was slower than we had originally anticipated  and consequently  our net operating income was lower than we had originally projected 
this resulted in our dividends related to our fiscal year exceeding our net operating income for the year by approximately million 
additionally  dividends related to our fiscal year exceeded our current and accumulated earnings and profits and  as a result  a portion of our dividends will be treated as a return of capital to our stockholders 
we anticipate borrowing funds and issuing additional equity securities to obtain additional capital once the proceeds of our initial public offering have been fully invested 
to this end  we have filed with the sec a registration statement that would permit us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  preferred stock and or debt securities 
we may not issue any such securities until the registration statement has been declared effective by the sec and we currently have no immediate plans to issue any securities under the registration statement 
in addition to borrowing funds and issuing additional equity securities  we also intend to pursue a strategy of securitizing our loan portfolio in approximately one to two years 
we would use the cash we receive upon the sale of interests in our loans to repay bank borrowings and make additional loans 
we can not assure you that this securitization strategy will be successful 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we expect that ultimately approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates  however  to date all of our loans have been made at fixed rates 
we expect to borrow funds to finance future lending activities after we have substantially fully invested the proceeds of our initial public offering 
these future borrowings may be at fixed rates or variable rates 
to date  we have not yet borrowed any funds 
we expect to hedge against interest rate fluctuations in the future by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse fluctuations in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments
