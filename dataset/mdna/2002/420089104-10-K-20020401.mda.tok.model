item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at december   approximately percent  or million  of the company s debt obligations bear interest at a variable rate 
to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations  in january  the company entered into an interest rate swap essentially converting million notional amount of its variable rate debt to a fixed base rate of percent 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flow to be exchanged and does not represent exposure to credit loss 
the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to the company would be approximately million 
the following table presents total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments of the company as of december  in millions total thereafter contractual cash obligations revolver term loan senior notes capital lease and other obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of the company s receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and the company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time 
the company currently does not hedge its foreign currency exposure and  therefore  has not entered into any forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
the company has operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in italian lira  canadian dollars  mexican pesos and chinese renminbi 
because the company has foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
the unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of december  are not expected to result in a significant impact on earnings or cash flows
