cleco power management s narrative analysis of the results of operations the following analysis should be read in combination with the financial statements and notes of cleco power contained in item of this report 
cleco power is providing the following narrative analysis of the results of its operations in lieu of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in accordance with instruction i a to form k omission of information by certain wholly owned subsidiaries 
revenues of cleco power are affected by the following factors retail rates for residential  commercial  and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the lpsc 
retail rates consist of a base rate and a fuel rate 
base rates are designed to allow recovery of the cost of providing service and a return on utility assets 
fuel rates fluctuate while allowing recovery of  with no profit  the majority of costs of purchased power and fuel used to generate electricity 
rates for transmission service and wholesale power sales are regulated by the ferc 
energy marketing revenues are based on the electric and natural gas markets  which are affected by supply and demand of those commodities and marketing strategies 
residential customers demand for electricity is affected by weather 
weather is generally measured in cooling degree days and heating degree days 
a cooling degree day is an indication of the likelihood of a consumer utilizing air conditioning  while a heating degree day is an indication of the likelihood of a consumer utilizing heating 
an increase in heating degree days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days because customers can choose an alternative fuel source for heating  such as natural gas 
normal heating and cooling degree days are calculated for a month by separately calculating the average actual heating and cooling degree days for that month over a period of approximately years 
commercial and industrial customers demand for electricity is less affected by the weather and is primarily dependent upon the strength of the economy in the service territory and the nation 
cleco power s two largest customers manufacture wood products  so its sales to industrial customers are affected by the worldwide demand for those products 
sales growth to retail electric customers has averaged over the last five years  and we expect it to range from to per year during the next five years 
the levels of future sales will depend upon factors such as weather conditions  customer conservation efforts  retail marketing and business development programs  and the economy of the service area 
some of the issues facing the electric utility industry that could affect sales include deregulation  retail wheeling  other legislative and regulatory changes  caption retention of large industrial customers and municipal franchises  changes in electric rates compared to customers ability to pay  and access to transmission systems 
energy marketing sales primarily are affected by demand and supply of energy  market prices  and transmission constraints 
fuel and power purchased are affected by the following factors changes in fuel and purchased power expenses reflect fluctuations in fuel used for generation  fuel costs  availability of economic power  and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through fuel adjustment clauses in subsequent months 
historically  changes in the cost of generating fuel and purchased power have not affected net income because substantially all such costs are passed on to customers through fuel adjustment clauses 
these adjustments are audited monthly and are regulated by the lpsc representing about of the total fuel cost adjustment and the ferc 
until approval is received  the adjustments are subject to refund 
coal and lignite are obtained both under long term contracts and through the spot market 
natural gas is purchased under short term contracts 
cleco power has several power contracts with two power marketing companies for mw of capacity in and  increasing to mw of capacity in power is purchased from other utilities and other marketers to supplement cleco power s generation at times of relatively high demand when the purchase price of the power is less than cleco power s cost of production 
however  transmission capacity must be available to transport the purchased power to cleco power s system in order for cleco power to be able to utilize the power 
during  of cleco power s energy requirements were met with purchased power  up from in and in in future years  cleco power s power plants may not supply enough power to meet its growing native load 
because of its location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on one main supplier of electric transmission  and constraints sometimes limit the amount of purchased power it can bring into its system 
the power contracts described above are not expected to be affected by such constraints 
an affiliate of cleco owns and operates natural gas pipelines at two of cleco power s power plants where natural gas is used as a primary fuel 
these pipelines increase access to natural gas markets and lower the cost of gas supplies 
other expenses other operations expenses are affected  among other things  by the cost of employee benefits  such as health care  the number of employees  changes in actuarial assumptions  and capacity charges 
maintenance expense generally is driven by the physical characteristics of the plant as well as planned preventive maintenance 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  cleco power s net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the decrease largely was due to lower margins from marketing and trading operations as well as lower base revenues from retail customer sales  which were partially offset by higher transmission and wholesale revenues 
there was a million increase in operating expenses in compared to primarily because of higher operations expense and purchases for energy marketing

offsetting this decrease was an increase of million in transmission related base revenues and a million increase in miscellaneous base revenues  resulting in a net million decrease in base revenues compared to the following chart indicates the percentage variance from normal conditions and from the prior year for cooling heating degree days 
cooling heating degree days for the year ended december  cooling degree days increase decrease from normal increase decrease from prior year heating degree days increase decrease from normal increase decrease from prior year short term electric sales to other utilities increased significantly during the increase primarily was due to sales to the city of lafayette under a one year replacement energy contract that began in december  and sales to the city of ruston under a three year contract to supply all of its power beginning june  fuel cost recovery revenues collected from customers increased primarily because the average per unit cost of fuel was per mmbtu in versus per mmbtu in the increase in the average per unit cost of fuel was primarily a result of a increase in the per unit cost of natural gas for compared to an earnings review settlement was reached with the lpsc in under which accruals for estimated customer credits are sometimes required 
cleco power accrued million during compared to million in the amount of credit due customers  if any  is determined by the lpsc annually  based on results for the month period ending september of each year 
for additional information  see the notes to cleco power s financial statements note accrual of estimated customer credits in item of this report 
energy marketing revenues for increased million compared to the increase in energy marketing revenues primarily is due to excess natural gas marketed and an increase in the price of natural gas in compared to cleco power s energy trading activity does not qualify for normal purchases normal sales exemption as defined by sfas no 
sfas no 
requires those open positions to be reported at fair market value or marked to market 
the mark to market related to these open positions was a gain of less than million for versus a gain of million in energy marketing operations for the year ended december  variance change thousands energy trading revenue mark to market total energy trading expenses net margins operating expenses increased million  or  during compared to energy marketing expenses increased million for compared to largely because of the same factors that caused increases in energy marketing revenues 
fuel expense increased million because of increased energy prices mainly driven by increases in the price of natural gas 
this increase was offset by a one time million adjustment reflecting the recognition of the recovery of fuel related costs that had not been previously collected from utility customers 
the fuel cost recovery was approved by the lpsc to be collected from customers and was therefore recognized  along with associated interest  in the fourth quarter of purchased power expense decreased million during compared to principally as a result of a decrease in the price of power purchased 
the increase in other operations expense for compared to primarily was due to a million increase in capacity payments  a million increase in vacation accrual  and an increase of million in employee benefits 
interest income increased million for compared to largely because of the interest related to the recognition of the recovery of fuel related costs that had not been previously collected from utility customers 
because the recovery of the fuel related costs is a one time adjustment  we do not expect the amount of interest income in future periods to be as much as experienced in interest expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in medium term notes and a decrease in the interest rates paid on commercial paper 
afudc increased to million in from million because of an increase in average construction 
allowance for funds used during construction represents cleco power s estimated cost of financing lpsc and ferc rate regulated construction and is not a current source of cash 
regulatory bodies allow for a return on and recovery of afudc when setting rates for utility services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cleco consolidated for information concerning the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition financial risk management on pages of the annual report to shareholders  which is filed as exhibit to this report and incorporated herein by reference 
cleco power financial risk management the market risk inherent in cleco power s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential change arising from changes in the short  medium and long term interest rates  the commodity price of electricity and the commodity price of natural gas 
generally  the market risk sensitive instruments and positions are considered normal purchases normal sales as defined by sfas no 
 as amended and clarified by the dig and are excluded from mark to market accounting 
however  cleco power does have positions that are required to be marked to market 
cleco power s exposure to market risk  as discussed below  represents an estimate of possible changes in the fair value or future earnings that would occur  assuming possible future movements in the interest rates and the commodity price of electricity and natural gas 
management s views on market risk are not necessarily indic ative of actual results  nor do they represent the maximum possible gains or losses 
the views do represent  within the parameters disclosed  what management estimates may happen 
interest cleco power has entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
see the notes to cleco power s financial statements  note debt in item of this report for details 
the calculations of the changes in fair market value and interest expense of the debt securities are made over a one year period 
as of december   the carrying value of cleco power s long term  fixed rate debt was approximately million  with a fair market value of approximately million 
fair value was determined using quoted market prices 
each change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately million in the fair values of these instruments 
if these instruments are held to maturity  no change in stated value will be realized 
as of december   the carrying value of cleco power s short term  variable rate debt was approximately million  which approximates the fair market value 
each change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately  in our pre tax earnings 
cleco power monitors its mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations  which consist of commercial paper  in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under its variable rate commercial paper program with fixed rate debt 
market risk management believes cleco power has in place controls to help minimize the risks involved in marketing and trading 
controls over marketing and trading consist of a back office accounting and mid office risk management independent of the marketing and trading operations  oversight by a risk management committee comprised of company officers and a daily risk report which shows var and current market conditions 
cleco s board of directors appoints the members of the risk management committee 
var limits are set and monitored by the risk management committee 
cleco power engages in marketing and trading of electricity and natural gas and provides fuel for generation and purchased power to meet the electricity demands of customers 
financial positions that are not used to meet the electricity demands of customers are marked to market 
at december   the net mark to market impact for those positions was a gain of less than million 
cleco power utilizes a var model to assess the market risk of its positions that are used in marketing and trading operations  including derivative financial instruments 
var represents the potential loss in fair values for an instrument from adverse changes in market factors for a specified period of time and confidence level 
the var is estimated using a historical simulation calculated daily assuming a holding period of one day  with a confidence level for natural gas positions and a confidence level for electricity positions 
total volatility is based on historical cash volatility  implied market volatility  current cash volatility and option pricing 
based on these assumptions  the high  low and average var for cleco power for the year ended december   as well as the var at december   and  is summarized below for the year ended december  at december  high low average thousands cleco power the following table summarizes the market value maturities of contracts with prices actively traded at december  fair value of contracts at period end contractual obligations maturity less than year maturity years maturity over years total fair value thousands assets cleco power liabilities cleco power
