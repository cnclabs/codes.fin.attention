item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the synthetic leases 
around the world  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
any failure by us to comply with present and future regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
item legal proceedings we from time to time are involved in various litigation and legal matters including those described below 
we are not a party to legal proceedings that individually or in the aggregate are believed to be material to our business 
on august   atel leasing corporation  a lessor of manufacturing equipment to us  filed suit against us in the california superior court for the city and county of san francisco atel leasing corp 
v 
solectron corp  case no 
 alleging that atel is entitled to recover as liquidated damages and not as a penalty amounts equal to the stipulated loss value of all of the equipment leased to us by atel under two equipment lease agreements  even though the equipment in question was neither lost nor damaged  and even though we were current on all lease installment payments and had paid all applicable late payment fees under the leases 
atel s complaint seeks liquidated damages of approximately million  plus additional interest allegedly accruing thereon  and litigation expenses 
we believe atel s claims are without merit  and that we have meritorious defenses  including that the liquidated damages provision upon which atel relies is an unenforceable penalty under california law 
in fact  the united states district court for the northern district of california ruled in a march opinion atel financial corp 
v 
quaker coal company  f 
supp 
d that a liquidated damages provision which atel had attempted to enforce in that case was an unenforceable penalty under california law 
while atel has appealed that ruling  we believe the us district court s decision was correct  and that the liquidated damages provisions which atel is attempting to enforce against us should similarly be held unenforceable under applicable california law 
we have filed a crosscomplaint against atel seeking damages and other appropriate relief 
on september   one of our former employees filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california  santa clara county  against us asserting two claims for wrongful termination 
the case is encaptioned ronald sorisho v 
solectron corporation  et al  case no 
cv in the complaint  plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully terminated by us in supposed retaliation for his alleged efforts to ensure that we timely recognized a charge for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory in the technology solutions business unit 
plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in an amount not less than million as well as punitive damages 
we believe mr 
sorisho s claims of wrongful termination are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves

we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported when we prepare financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  our accounting for contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  and restructuring costs 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our net sales are primarily derived from full product manufacturing including  but not limited to  pcba  sub system and complete system assembly and manufacturing of memory products and embedded systems 
we also offer services consisting of repair  warranty and end customer technical support services 
revenue from manufacturing services is recognized upon shipment of the manufactured product 
revenue from other services is recognized as the services are performed 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
estimated loss contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
inventory reserves the majority of our inventory purchase commitments are based upon demand forecasts that our customers provide to us 
the forecasted period is generally three months  except for long lead time items for which the period is longer 
customers frequently make changes to their forecasts  thereby often requiring that we make changes to our inventory purchases  commitments  and production scheduling and may require us to cancel open purchase commitments with our vendors 
this process may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of the customer s revised needs  or parts that become obsolete before use in production 
we execute supply agreements with our most significant customers in our global operations business unit 
under these supply agreements  the responsibility for excess or obsolete inventory related to raw materials that we purchased or ordered to meet customers demand forecasts lies with the customers 
however  we are responsible for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from inventory purchases in excess of inventory needed to meet customer demand forecasts at the time the purchase commitments were made  as well as inventory purchases generally not covered by our supply agreements with our customers or for inventory purchases for customers with whom we have no supply agreements as is generally the case in our business units other than global operations 
each supply agreement specifies the agreed upon definition of excess and obsolete inventory and the procedures for disposition including our right to sell the inventory back to the customer 
the supply agreements generally allow a period of time during which we and our customers work together to reduce or eliminate the amount of potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
after the expiration of the specified time period  we may exercise our contractual right to sell the remaining excess and obsolete inventory back to the customer 
the time period allowed to mitigate excess and obsolete inventory can be up to months 
consequently  there will be time lags between when excess or obsolete inventory is first identified and when we are paid from the exercise of our right to sell this inventory to the customer 
we do not provide inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventory when i the supply agreement provides us with the contractual right to sell inventory that is considered excess or obsolete back to our customers  and ii we believe the customer is capable of honoring its contractual obligation to purchase the inventory 
if our customers do not comply with their contractual obligations  the inventory reserves included in our financial statements may be understated 
for example  we are subject to the risk that a customer may not comply with its contractual obligation to purchase the excess and obsolete inventory under a supply agreement because the customer is experiencing weakening financial conditions 
in fiscal  several of our customers  including customers who accounted for or more 
table of contents of our fiscal revenue  were in the telecommunications industry  an industry that has experienced declining revenue  large losses  negative cash flows  and several bankruptcies or defaults on borrowing arrangements 
there is a risk that these customers may not purchase inventory back from us which could harm our financial condition 
during  no material customer informed us that it would be unable to honor its contractual obligation under a supply agreement to purchase excess or obsolete inventory from us 
for our global operations business unit  we record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory for inventory which we have determined that our customers are not responsible for or for which we believe they are unable to live up to their obligation to purchase such inventory from us 
for our other business units  we make judgments with respect to recording inventory reserves based on various factors such as the aging and anticipated future demand of the inventory 
in these other units  we generally do not have the right to require our customers to purchase excess or obsolete inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has been incurred 
such events or circumstances may include significant adverse changes in the general business climate  among others 
we perform the impairment tests at the reporting unit level which we have determined to be consistent with our business units as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements except for our technology solutions and global services business units which were disaggregated further 
the tests are performed by determining the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted future cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values of the reporting units  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we then allocate the fair value of the unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit s fair value was the purchase price to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts  discount rates and various reporting unit allocations 
other intangible assets we perform quarterly impairment tests for other intangible assets 
our intangible assets are primarily related to supply agreements and intellectual property obtained from asset acquisitions 
such an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset  if any  exceeds its fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model 
while our cash flow assumptions and estimated useful lives are consistent with our business plans  there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets 
restructuring and related impairment costs we have recorded restructuring and impairment costs in light of customer demand declines and economic downturns 
these restructuring and impairment charges include employee severance and benefit costs  costs related to leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased and owned facilities no longer used by us which will be disposed of  costs related to leased equipment that will be abandoned and impairment of owned equipment that will be disposed of 
for owned facilities and equipment  the impairment loss recognized was based on the fair value less costs to sell  with fair value estimated based on existing market prices for similar assets 
severance and benefit costs are recorded in compliance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  the estimated lease loss is accrued for future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less any estimated sublease income 
in order to estimate future sublease income  we work with an independent broker to determine the length of time until we believe we can sublease a facility generally estimated at months and the amount of rent we expect to receive 
as of august   the majority of the facilities we plan to sublease have not been and  accordingly  our estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the real estate market  among others 
for owned facilities and equipment held for disposal  the impairment losses recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of are based on the fair value estimated using existing market prices for similar assets less the costs to sell 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  restructuring for further discussion of our restructuring activities 

table of contents results of operations the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
these and other factors affecting the electronics industry  or any of our major customers in particular  could materially harm our results of operations 
see risk factors for additional factors relating to possible fluctuations of our operating results 
results of operations for years ended august   and the following table summarizes certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development goodwill amortization expense acquisition costs restructuring and impairment costs operating income loss net interest income expense gain on retirement of debt income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales for the year ended august   net sales fell to billion  a decrease of from fiscal net sales of billion in fiscal were greater than fiscal the sales decline in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to continued weakness in customer demand  particularly in our telecommunications sector  resulting from the worldwide economic slowdown 
the decrease was partially offset by revenues from our recent acquisitions including c mac which contributed approximately to of our total revenues in fiscal the sales growth in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to increased demand from our personal computer  notebook computer  consumer and automotive business sectors in the first half of fiscal  and our acquisitions during fiscal we are organized in four business units including global operations  technology solutions  global services and the newly established microsystems created from our acquisition of c mac in december our largest business unit  global operations  provided  and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and our technology solutions business unit contributed   and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and our global services business unit contributed  and of net sales  respectively  in fiscal  and our microsystems business unit contributed of net sales during fiscal 
table of contents global operations business unit fiscal net sales declined to billion  a decrease of from fiscal year this decrease was due to continued weakness in customer demand  particularly in our telecommunications sector 
fiscal net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal this increase was due to higher demand growth from our customers during the first half of fiscal and the acquisition of natsteel electronics ltd nel and shinei as well as two sony manufacturing plants during fiscal technology solutions business unit net sales for fiscal years  and were million  billion and billion  respectively 
the reduction in fiscal of from fiscal and the decrease in fiscal of from fiscal were principally due to sluggish demand and declines in average selling prices of memory components 
global services business unit net sales were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our recent acquisitions of stream international and artesyn solutions  inc were the main contributors to the increase as well as higher demand by customers for after sales support service provided by this business unit 
the increase of in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to stronger customer demand and acquisitions of ibm netherlands service facilities as well as mcc sequel during fiscal microsystems business unit this new business unit was formed as a result of our acquisition of c mac 
our microsystems business unit is a provider of sensors  controllers  actuators and other sophisticated componentry for key sectors of the economy such as automotive and aviation 
net sales were million in fiscal international sales net sales from our international sites  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  have grown over the last three fiscal years 
international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the increase was primarily due to project transfers from sites in the united states to asian sites 
these transfers are primarily due to lower costs in asia 
as a result of our international sales and facilities  our operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
see risk factors for additional factors relating to possible fluctuations of our international operating results 
while these dynamics have not materially harmed our results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact in the future 
major customers net sales to major customers as a percentage of consolidated net sales were as follows years ended august  nortel hp compaq cisco ericsson less than percents in all periods presented reflect the combined net sales to hp and compaq due to their merger in may our top ten customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we are dependent upon continued revenues from nortel  cisco and hp compaq as well as our other large customers 
we cannot guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could materially harm our results of operations 

table of contents we believe that our ability to grow depends on increasing sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations and on successfully attracting new customers 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be ensured 
in addition  we cannot assume that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
consequently  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
gross profit our gross margin percentages were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory 
this charge recorded in cost of sales resulted in reduction of gross margin and included excess and obsolete inventory identified in our product oriented technology solutions and other business units 
in addition  our gross margin was affected by inefficiencies associated with reduced workload and restructuring activities 
we continue to shift capacity to low cost locations 
those transfer costs were accounted for as operational costs versus restructuring costs and  consequently  they affected our gross margins 
for our global operations business unit  we anticipate a larger percentage of our sales may be derived from systems build projects that generally yield lower profit margins than pcba 
we expect most of our technology solutions sales may continue to be derived from turn key projects  which typically yield lower profit margins than consignment projects 
in addition  factors affecting technology solutions profit margins include the sales mix of specialty memory modules  standard memory modules  communication card products and embedded computer systems  as well as changes in average memory densities used in memory products 
in the foreseeable future  our overall gross margin will depend primarily on several factors  including but not limited to  product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  percentage of sales derived from systems build and turn key projects  pricing within the electronics industry  component costs and delivery linearity  and the cost structure at individual sites 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for solectron as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
increases in the systems build business or turn key projects  additional costs associated with new projects  and price erosion within the electronics industry could harm our gross margin 
in addition  we have in the past experienced component shortages 
while the component availability fluctuates from time to time and is subject to lead time and other constraints  this could possibly have a negative impact on our sales and gross margins in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we cannot assure that our gross margin will not fluctuate or decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses remained consistent in fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from a large reduction in net sales and the fact that some portions of these expenses were fixed 
the increases in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were due to higher human resource costs  information systems costs  and higher sg a resulting from our acquisitions of nel  centennial  mcc sequel  shinei and two sony manufacturing facilities

goodwill amortization expense we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective september   and discontinued amortization of goodwill in fiscal the goodwill amortization expense of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the nel acquisition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased all of the outstanding issued share capital and convertible bonds of nel for approximately billion and million  respectively 
the nel acquisition was accounted for under the purchase accounting method and  as a result  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill that was amortized over ten years prior to our adoption of the new standard in fiscal 
table of contents acquisition costs during fiscal  we recorded million in acquisition and integration costs  which were primarily related to the nel acquisition and were not includable in the purchase price 
a charge for acquisition costs of million was incurred in fiscal as a result of our pooling transactions with smart  americom and bluegum during fiscal our acquisition costs consisted of investment banker fees  legal fees  accounting fees  registration fees and other direct costs 
restructuring and impairment costs restructuring beginning in fiscal  we embarked on a restructuring plan to review our operations in light of the economic downturn and began undertaking several measures to restructure the company 
the measures  which included reducing the workforce  consolidating certain facilities and changing the strategic focus of a number of sites  were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand as well as rationalize our footprint worldwide 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and impairment costs related to this plan of million against earnings 
these restructuring and impairment charges occurred primarily in the second and third quarters  included employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased of million  costs related to leased equipment that will be abandoned of million  impairment of equipment of million  impairment of facilities of million  impairment of it software and other assets of million and other exit costs of million 
the employee severance and benefit costs included in these restructuring charges relate to the elimination of approximately  full time positions worldwide and all such positions have been eliminated under this plan 
approximately of the positions eliminated were in the americas region  were in europe and were in asia pacific 
the employment reductions primarily affected employees in manufacturing and back office support functions 
facilities and equipment subject to restructuring were primarily located in the americas and europe within the global operations business unit 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  the lease costs represent future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less estimated sublease income 
for owned facilities and equipment  the impairment loss recognized was based on the fair value less cost to sell  with fair value based on estimates of existing market prices for similar assets 
during fiscal  we recorded total restructuring and impairment costs of million against earnings 
these restructuring and impairment charges occurred primarily in the third and fourth quarters  included employee severance and benefit costs of million  costs related to leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased of million  costs related to leased equipment that will be abandoned of approximately million  impairment of equipment of million  impairment of facilities of million  impairment of goodwill  intangible and other assets related to closed facilities of million and other exit costs of million 
the employee severance and benefit costs included in the fiscal restructuring charges related to the elimination of approximately  full time positions worldwide and all such positions have been eliminated under this plan

we recorded restructuring costs of million in fiscal primarily related to the consolidations of certain facilities acquired in the smart and sequel mergers 
in furtherance of the implementation of the restructuring plan  we expect to incur restructuring related charges in the range of an aggregate of million over the next few quarters  although no certainty can be attributed to this amount or the timing of its recognition 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure relative to our revenue levels and may take additional restructuring charges in the future 
if we incur additional restructuring related charges  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
goodwill and other intangible asset charges in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated lives to their estimated residual values  and be reviewed for impairment according to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 

table of contents sfas no 
required that we evaluate existing intangible assets and goodwill that we acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform to the new criteria in sfas no 
 business combinations  for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and no significant changes were deemed necessary 
we were also required to test the intangible assets for impairment within the first interim period and no impairment loss was deemed necessary 
for the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas no 
required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption  or step one of the impairment test 
to accomplish this  we identified the reporting units to be consistent with the business units as defined in note except for our technology solutions and global services business units which were disaggregated further 
we then determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by allocating the assets and liabilities  including the goodwill and intangible assets  to the units as of the date of adoption 
we had up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill is impaired and we are required to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we performed step one of the transitional test and concluded that there was no impairment and no second step was necessary 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
which included step one as described above for each of our reporting units 
results of step one indicated that an impairment existed within our global operations business unit since the estimated fair value  based on expected future discounted cash flows to be generated from the unit  was less than its carrying value 
pursuant to the second step of the test  we compared the implied fair value of the unit s goodwill determined by allocating the unit s fair value  based on the expected future discounted cash flows  to all its assets  recognized and unrecognized  and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business to its carrying amount 
in connection with allocating the fair value of the global operations business unit  we also obtained independent valuations of certain unrecognized intangible assets as well as our fixed assets 
the discounted cash flow models used to determine the fair values of the reporting units in the tests were prepared using revenue and expense projections based on our current operating plan 
the revenue projections are our best estimates considering current and expected economic and industry conditions 
the discounted cash flow model also included a terminal value for years six and beyond that assumes future free cash flow growth ranging from to based on our estimates and standard industry rates used by analysts monitoring our industry 
the cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital ranging from to which is our best estimate considering the debt and equity structure of the company and external industry data 
the discounted cash flows related to the terminal value represents approximately of total expected future discounted cash flows 
significant negative industry and economic trends affecting our current and future operations as well as a significant decline in our stock price contributed to our fourth quarter impairment test resulting in an impairment of our goodwill related to our global operations business unit of approximately billion 
in addition  we performed our quarterly impairment test of other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we recorded an impairment charge related to a supply agreement with a major customer of approximately million 
this impairment occurred due to reduced expectations of our realized sales under our supply agreement with that customer and was measured by comparing the intangible asset s carrying amount to the fair value as determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the impairments referred to above were recorded within restructuring and impairment costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the quarter and year ended august  the process of evaluating the potential impairment is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts  discount rates and various reporting unit allocations 
we may continue to experience goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges in the future as a result of adverse changes in the electronics industry  customer demand and other market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
net interest income expense net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and net interest income of million in fiscal the net interest expense increase in fiscal primarily resulted from our issuance of the adjustable conversion rate equity security units aces and the senior notes due during the second quarter of fiscal which bear interest at a higher rate than the liquid yield option notes lyons securities they effectively replaced 
the net interest expense in fiscal primarily resulted from our issuances of  and lyons and senior notes 
the net interest income in fiscal was attributed primarily to interest income earned on cash and investments from the proceeds of the lyons which were issued in may trademark of merrill lynch co  inc 
table of contents gain on retirement of debt during fiscal  in our continuing effort to strengthen our balance sheet  we retired approximately billion of accreted values of lyons for cash of approximately billion resulting in a gain of million 
see footnote to our unaudited quarterly financial information 
due to our early adoption of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements nos 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  such gains were reclassified from extraordinary to a separate line within non operating income expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
also  there was a loss of million resulting from retirement of other long term debt 
income taxes we reported income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal arising from the loss incurred in those periods 
income tax expense was million in fiscal our effective income tax benefit rates were and in fiscal and  respectively 
our effective income tax expense rate was in fiscal our benefit rate in fiscal was less than the fiscal rate due principally to goodwill impairment expense  which for the most part is nondeductible for tax purposes 
our benefit rate in fiscal was lower than our expense rate in preceding years because we did not recognize certain income tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions for which future realization is uncertain 
in general  the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and international operations 
our international operations  taken as a whole  have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to several of our overseas sites in malaysia  singapore  and china 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through july  subject to some conditions  including maintaining certain levels of research and development expenditures 
the singapore tax holiday is effective through march  subject to some conditions 
seven of our china sites have separate tax holiday agreements 
each agreement expires five years from the first profitable year for each site 
five of these sites have tax holidays expiring from december through december two sites have not yet incurred a profitable year  thus the expiration of the tax holiday status for those sites has not yet been determined 
the net impact of these tax holidays was to decrease net loss by approximately million  or per diluted share  in and approximately million  or per diluted share  in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to billion at august  from billion at august  we also had million in restricted cash and cash equivalents 
our short term investments decreased to million at august   from million at august  in addition  we had million of restricted short term investments at august  our restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are restricted primarily related to leasing transactions see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements and collateral for our obligations under the aces securities in an amount equal to the next five quarterly interest payments 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of cash used in financing activities of approximately billion 
we also used million in investing activities primarily for capital expenditures  business and asset acquisitions 
the decrease was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of approximately billion 
through our recent offering of aces due and the senior notes due  we raised net proceeds of approximately billion and million  respectively 
we used approximately billion of our available cash towards repurchase of approximately billion of accreted value of our lyons during fiscal we also repaid other debt including c mac s outstanding debt assumed upon acquisition of approximately million 
accounts receivable decreased to approximately billion at august  from approximately billion at august  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to our revenue reduction and our collection efforts during fiscal inventories decreased to billion at august  from approximately billion at august  the inventory decrease was primarily due to the sale of excess raw materials inventory back to customers and continued efforts on inventory management 
as of august   we had available a million revolving line of credit that expires on february   and a million revolving line of credit that expires on february  each of our revolving lines of credit is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of equity interest in certain of our subsidiaries and notes evidencing intercompany debt 
borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest  at our option  at the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin of based on our current senior unsecured debt ratings  or the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or bank of america na s publicly announced prime rate 
as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit 
these credit facilities are subject to compliance with certain covenants including capital expenditures  consolidated tangible net worth  cash interest coverage  liquidity and other restrictions 
as of august   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
on december   moody s investor s service and standard poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba and bb  respectively  with a negative outlook 
on march   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bb with a negative outlook 
on may   moody s investors services further downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to 
table of contents ba with a stable outlook 
these rating downgrades will increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving lines of credit  and may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future 
such capital raising activities may be on terms that may not be acceptable to us or otherwise not available 
in addition  we had million in committed and million in uncommitted foreign lines of credit and other bank facilities as of august  a committed line of credit obligates a lender to loan us amounts under the credit facility as long as we adhere to the terms of the credit agreement 
an uncommitted line of credit is extended to us at the sole discretion of a lender 
the interest rates range from the bank s prime lending rate to the bank s prime rate plus 
as of august   borrowings and guaranteed amounts were million and million under committed and uncommitted foreign lines of credit  respectively 
borrowings were payable on demand 
the weighted average interest rate was for committed and for uncommitted foreign lines of credit as of august  we have purchased in the past and may continue to purchase in the future our remaining lyons on an opportunistic basis 
in addition  our liquidity could be adversely affected if we require substantial amounts of cash in connection with our obligations to purchase our lyons as they become due 
instead of repurchasing the lyons with cash  we may elect to offer holders our common stock or a combination of our cash and common stock 
at the time of such election  it may be in the best interest of our shareholders to satisfy such obligation in cash  however  we may not have sufficient cash available and we may not be able to finance the required amount on acceptable terms if at all 
as a result  we may be required to satisfy such obligations with our common stock  which would be extremely dilutive at our current stock prices 
see risk factors our obligations under lyons may cause dilution and reduction of earnings per share 
based on the aggregate amount outstanding on august   holders of our lyons due have the option to require us to repurchase their notes in an amount of per  principal amount for a total of million on may  these lyons due are classified as short term debt as of august  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet

the synthetic leases have expiration dates in at the end of the lease term  we have an option  subject to certain conditions  to purchase or to cause a third party to purchase the facilities subject to the synthetic leases for the termination value  which approximates the lessor s original cost  or may market the property to a third party at a different price 
we are entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the properties to third parties in excess of the termination value 
in connection with our restructuring of these synthetic leases  we and our subsidiaries provided loans to the lessor under each synthetic lease  equaling approximately of its initial termination value 
these loans are repayable solely from the sale of the properties to third parties in the future  are subordinated to the amounts payable to the lessor at the end of the terms of the synthetic leases  and may be credited against the termination value payable if we or our subsidiaries purchase the properties 
the approximate maximum termination values and loan amounts for each of the synthetic leases are provided below in millions 
termination value loan amount a milpitas  ca for land b milpitas  ca for improvements c san jose  ca d columbia  sc e fremont  ca f fremont  ca total cash collateral  in an aggregate amount of million is pledged for the difference between the termination values and the loan amounts 
each lease agreement contains various affirmative and financial covenants 
a default under a lease  including violation of these covenants  may accelerate the termination date of the arrangement 
as of august  we were in compliance with all such covenants 
monthly lease payments are generally based on the termination value and day libor index as of august  plus an interest rate margin  which may vary depending upon our moody s investors services  and standard and poor s ratings and are allocated between the lessor and us and our subsidiaries based on the proportion of our loan amount to the total termination value for each synthetic lease 
after the restructuring  we have continued to account for these synthetic lease arrangements as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
our loans to the lessor are included in long term other assets in our consolidated balance 
table of contents sheet as of august  the cash collateral is included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of august  if we should determine that it is probable that the expected fair value of the property at the end of the lease term will be less than the termination value  we will recognize any expected loss on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  lines of credit and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure  debt service and investment requirements through at least the next months

recent developments on june   we completed our acquisition of magnetic data technologies mdt  a global provider of after sales services for the communications  computer and electronic storage markets for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business 
on may   we announced the completion of a three year supply agreement to produce optical networking equipment for lucent 
as part of the three year supply agreement  we purchased equipment and inventory related to lucent s optical product lines for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
subsequently  as a result of significant changes in the marketplace and decreased demand  both parties reached a mutual agreement in principle on october  to unwind this supply agreement 
we have agreed in principle with lucent to unwind the outsourcing and asset purchase transaction involving lucent s optical networking systems in andover  massachusetts 
we expect to enter into with lucent a definitive agreement to unwind the may  transaction in our first quarter of fiscal under the general terms of the agreement in principle  lucent will repurchase the equipment and unused inventory that we acquired in may we will continue to produce and support a portion of lucent s optical networking products through march of we do not anticipate any losses on changes to this supply agreement 
risk factors we are exposed to general economic conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of unfavorable general economic conditions in the us and internationally  and reduced capital spending as well as end market demand  our sales have continued to decline in recent fiscal quarters 
we began to see a sales decline in the telecommunications  workstation and server equipment manufacturing industry worldwide during the second half of fiscal in particular  we depend on the telecommunications industry for a significant amount of our revenues 
continued weakness in this industry or any further deterioration in the business or financial condition of our customers in this industry could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if the economic conditions in the united states and the other markets we serve worsen  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have significant debt leverage and debt service obligations 
for the fiscal year ended august  our fixed charges exceeded our earnings by billion as compared to our ratio of earnings to fixed charges of x for fiscal year the fixed charge excess is primarily due to our operating losses and interest expense growing at a greater rate since the second half of fiscal and during fiscal year we have computed the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing earnings available for fixed charges by fixed charges 
the computations include us and our consolidated subsidiaries 
for these ratios  earnings represents income loss before taxes and before adjustment for minority interests  plus fixed charges excluding capitalized interest  plus amortization of capitalized interest 
fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness and amortization of debt discount and expense  plus capitalized interest  plus an interest factor attributable to rentals under operating leases 
as of august   we had approximately million of short term indebtedness  including million of current portion of long term indebtedness  and billion of long term indebtedness which in the case of all liquid yield option notes were the accreted values as of that date 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  as well as future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
in addition  we may require substantial amounts of cash in connection with our obligations to repurchase our lyons 
in connection with our tender offer for our lyons due  which expired on july   we purchased billion aggregate principal amount at maturity of these 
table of contents lyons and million aggregate principal amount at maturity of these lyons remained outstanding as of august  based on the aggregate amount outstanding on august   on may   holders of our lyons due will have the option to require us to repurchase their notes in an amount of per  principal amount for a total of up to approximately million 
based on the aggregate amount outstanding on august   on may   holders of our lyons due will have the option to require us to repurchase their notes in an amount of per  principal amount for a total of approximately billion 
instead of repurchasing the lyons with cash  we may elect to offer holders our common stock or a combination of our cash and common stock 
at the time of such election  it may be in the best interests of our shareholders to satisfy such obligation in cash  however  we may not have sufficient cash available and we may not be able to finance the required amount on acceptable terms if at all 
as a result  we may be required to satisfy such obligations with our common stock  which would be extremely dilutive at our current stock prices 
our ability to meet our cash requirements depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to meet our cash requirements including our debt service obligations is dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements from operations we would be required to fund these cash requirements by alternative financings 
the degree to which we may be leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes  could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures  or could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in the electronics manufacturing industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing  that any such financing would be on acceptable terms  or that we will be permitted to do so under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  make future acquisitions  react to adverse operating results  meet our debt service obligations or fund required capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to sell excess or obsolete inventory to customers or otherwise which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
the majority of our inventory purchases and commitments are based upon demand forecasts that our customers provide to us 
the customer forecast  and any changes to the forecasts  including cancellations  may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of the customer s revised needs  or that become obsolete 
we execute supply agreements with our most significant customers in our global operations business unit  which accounts for a majority of the inventory we purchase 
under the supply agreements  the responsibility for excess or obsolete inventory related to raw materials that were previously purchased or ordered to meet a customer s demand forecast lies with the customer 
if our customers do not comply with their contractual obligations to purchase excess or obsolete inventory back from us  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
in addition  enforcement of these supply agreements may result in material expenses or delays in payment for inventory 
we are solely responsible for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from inventory purchases in excess of inventory needed to meet customer demand forecasts at the time the purchase commitments were made  as well as inventory purchases generally not covered by our supply agreements or for inventory purchased for customers with whom we have no supply agreements as is generally the case for the customers in our technology solutions  global services and microsystems business units 
in these instances  since we do not have the right to sell back excess or obsolete inventory to our customers  we must bear the economic loss of any such excess or obsolete inventory which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory 
this charge resulted in a reduction in our gross margin and included excess and obsolete inventory identified in our product oriented technology solutions and other business units 
the agreements governing our existing and future debt contain and will contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business 
the agreements and instruments governing our existing and future debt and our secured credit facilities contain and may  in the future  contain various restrictive covenants that  among other things  require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios thereby restricting our ability to incur debt  incur or maintain liens  redeem and or prepay subordinated debt  make acquisitions of businesses or entities  
table of contents make investments  including loans  guarantees and advances  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  consolidations or certain sales of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or engage in stock redemptions  and enter into certain restrictive agreements 
our secured credit facilities are secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our material domestic subsidiaries  of the capital stock of our first tier material foreign subsidiaries and certain of our intercompany loans 
our ability to comply with covenants contained in our existing debt and our secured credit facilities and other indebtedness to which we are or may become a party may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
our failure to comply with our debt related covenants could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness and cross defaults under our other indebtedness  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants  the restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financings  mergers  acquisitions and other corporate opportunities 
in light of our recent financial performance  we amended our credit facilities on june  in order to make them less restrictive 
we amended the liens  capital expenditures  consolidated tangible net worth and cash interest coverage ratio covenants as well as certain other terms of the credit facilities 
we also added a liquidity ratio covenant 
these amendments were effective as of may  most of our net sales come from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our net sales could decline significantly 
most of our annual net sales come from a small number of our customers 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately   and of net sales in fiscal   and respectively 
some of these customers individually account for more than ten percent of our annual net sales 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other major customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly  and we may not be able to reduce the accompanying expenses at the same time 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain any of our largest customers or any other accounts  or that we will be able to realize the expected revenues under existing supply agreements with these customers 
our business  market share  financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend significantly on our ability to obtain orders from new customers  retain existing customers  realize expected revenues under existing supply agreements  as well as on the financial condition and success of our customers and their customers 
in addition to the above  some industry sources have projected that our market share by revenues may decline in the near term 
net sales may decline in future periods due to the continued weakness in customer demand  particularly in our telecommunications sector  resulting from the worldwide economic slowdown 
in addition  net sales may be adversely affected due to our unwinding of the lucent supply agreement which was expected to generate billion in revenues over the next three years 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or locations  or delay production 
electronics manufacturing services ems companies must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
although we have long term contracts with a few of our top ten customers  including ericsson and nortel  under which these customers are obligated to obtain services from us  only nortel is obligated to purchase any minimum amount of services 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will receive any net sales from these contracts or any of our other contracts with customers 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
many of our customers industries are experiencing a significant decrease in demand for their products and services 
the generally uncertain economic condition of several of the industries of our customers has resulted  and may continue to result  in some of our customers delaying the purchase orders on some of the products we manufacture for them  and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers would seriously harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products manufactured by us for the customers and delivered in that period  as well as causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins 
in addition  customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to achieve cost and other objectives 
such transfers  if unanticipated  can result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and related strains on our resources at the other 

table of contents our strategic relationships with major customers create risks 
in the past couple of years  we have completed several strategic transactions with oem customers 
under these arrangements  we generally acquire inventory  equipment and other assets from the oem  and lease or in some cases acquire their manufacturing facilities  while simultaneously entering into multi year supply agreements for the production of their products 
we intend to continue to pursue these oem divestiture transactions in the future 
there is strong competition among ems companies for these transactions  and this competition may increase 
these transactions have contributed to a significant portion of our past revenue growth  and if we fail to complete similar transactions in the future  our revenue could be harmed 
as part of these arrangements  we typically enter into manufacturing services agreements with these oems 
these agreements generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchases by the oem  and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated 
the arrangements entered into with divesting oems typically involve many risks  including the following we may pay a purchase price to the divesting oems that exceeds the value we may realize from the future business of the oem  the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly  we  rather than the divesting oem  bear the risk of excess capacity  we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies  we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions  and if demand for the oem s products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems 
as a result of these and other risks  we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements  and they may not result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
additionally  other oems may not wish to obtain logistics or operations management services from us 
if we are unable to manage our acquisitions and cost effectively assimilate new operations  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we have experienced rapid growth over many years 
concurrently  we have established operations in different locations throughout the world 
during fiscal  we completed acquisitions of c mac and mdt  among others 
we intend to consider making acquisitions of companies and strategic assets under our acquisition strategy subject to compliance with any restrictions that may exist under certain of our financing instruments 
these acquisitions may be for cash  capital stock or any combination of cash and capital stock  or other property  and may include the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and a reduction of our available cash 
in order to achieve anticipated revenue and other financial performance targets  we must manage our assets and operations efficiently and integrate our acquisitions 
our acquisitions place a heavy strain on our personnel and management  manufacturing and other resources 
our ability to manage and integrate our acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions  will require progressive increases in manufacturing infrastructure  as well as enhancements or upgrades of accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation of a variety of procedures and controls 
we cannot assure that significant problems in these areas will not occur 
any failure to enhance or expand these systems and implement such procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  should we continue to expand geographically  we may experience inefficiencies from the management of geographically dispersed facilities 
as we manage and continue to expand new operations  we may incur substantial infrastructure and working capital costs 
we incurred million of restructuring related charges in fiscal and expect to incur approximately million of such charges over the next few quarters 
see the risk factor entitled if we incur more restructuring related charges than currently anticipated  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
possible fluctuation of operating results from quarter to quarter and factors out of our control could affect the market price of our securities 
our quarterly earnings and or stock price may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including the following differences in the profitability of the types of manufacturing services we provide 
for example  high velocity and low complexity printed circuit boards and systems assembly services have lower gross margins than low volume complex printed circuit boards and systems assembly services  our ability to maximize the hours of use of our equipment and facilities is dependent on the duration of the production run time for each job and customer  
table of contents the amount of automation that we can use in the manufacturing process for cost reduction varies  depending upon the complexity of the product being made  our customers demand for our products  and their ability to take delivery of our products and to make timely payments for delivered products  our ability to optimize the ordering of inventory as to timing and amount to avoid holding inventory in excess of immediate production needs  our ability to offer technologically advanced cost effective  quick response  manufacturing services  fluctuations in demand for our services or the products being manufactured  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of components  timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our target markets  expenses associated with acquisitions  announcements of operating results and business conditions by our customers  announcements by our competitors relating to new customers or technological innovation or new services  economic developments in the electronics industry as a whole  credit ratings downgrades may have a negative impact on our stock price  and political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations  and general market conditions 
if our operating results in the future are below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our outstanding securities could be harmed 
if we incur more restructuring related charges than currently anticipated  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
in furtherance of the implementation of the restructuring plan we announced in fiscal  we expect to incur restructuring related charges in the range of an aggregate of million over the next few quarters  although no certainty can be attributed to this amount or the timing of its recognition 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure relative to our revenue levels and may take additional restructuring charges in the future 
if we incur additional restructuring related charges  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we depend on limited or sole source suppliers for critical components 
the inability to obtain sufficient components as required would cause harm to our business 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide key components used in our products 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  delays in component deliveries  which in turn could cause delays in product shipments and require the redesign of certain products 
also for our technology solutions business unit  we are dependent upon certain limited or sole source suppliers for critical components used for our memory module  communications card and embedded computer products 
the electronics industry has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  shortages in semiconductor devices  including application specific integrated circuits  dram  sram  flash memory  certain passive devices such as tantalum capacitors  and other commodities that may be caused by such conditions as overall market demand surges or supplier production capacity constraints 
the inability to continue to obtain sufficient components as required  or to develop alternative sources as required  could cause delays  disruptions or reductions in product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with current or prospective customers and increase inventory levels  thereby causing harm to our business 

table of contents we potentially bear the risk of price increases associated with shortages in the availability of electronics components 
at various times  there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry leading to increased component prices 
one of the services that we perform for many customers is purchasing electronics components used in the manufacturing of the customers products 
as a result of this service  we potentially bear the risk of price increases for these components if we are unable to purchase components at the pricing level anticipated to support the margins assumed in our agreements with our customers 
our net sales could decline if our competitors provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at a lower cost 
we compete with different contract manufacturers  depending on the type of service we provide or the geographic locale of our operations 
the memory module  communications card and embedded computer subsystem industries are also intensely competitive 
these competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  r d and or marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
our inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than our competitors could cause our net sales to decline 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater value added performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  or profit margin compression 
we depend on the continuing trend of oems to outsource 
a substantial factor in our past revenue growth was attributable to the transfer of manufacturing and supply based management activities from our oem customers 
future growth is partially dependent on new outsourcing opportunities 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  our future growth would be unfavorably impacted 
our non us locations represent a significant and growing portion of our net sales  we are increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
in fiscal  approximately of net sales came from sites outside the united states  while approximately of net sales came from sites outside the united states in fiscal as a result of our foreign sales and facilities  our operations are subject to a variety of risks that are unique to international operations  including the following adverse movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar in which our results are reported  import and export duties  and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports  potential restrictions on the transfer of funds  disruption of local labor supply  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws  economic and political risks in emerging or developing economies  and exposure to increased inefficiency as a result of a work stoppage caused by a labor dispute between dockworkers and shipping companies 
we have been granted tax holidays  which are effective through  subject to some conditions  for our malaysian and singapore sites 
we have also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
it is possible that the current tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays that we may seek will not be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified  if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future or when our current tax holidays expire  our effective income tax rate would likely increase 

table of contents we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency receivables  investments and payables 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on the foreign currency receivables  investments  and payables recognized in earnings 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative purposes 
our foreign exchange forward contracts related to current assets and liabilities are generally three months or less in original maturity 
we periodically hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses with foreign exchange forward contracts 
these transactions are treated as cash flow hedges 
these foreign exchange forward contracts generally have original maturities of months or less 
as of august   we had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately million 
the change in value of the foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates would be offset by the remeasurement of the related balance sheet items 
the net result would not be significant 
as of august   the majority of our foreign currency hedging contracts were scheduled to mature in approximately three months and there were no material deferred gains or losses 
in addition  our international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
although approximately of our net sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than us dollar  we do not believe our total exposure to be significant because of natural hedges 
we have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our sites 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the currency of the exposure and the functional currency of our sites could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time  maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august   approximately of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than six months 
in addition  our investments are diversified and of relatively short maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our investment portfolios 
we had million of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk as of august  the weighted average interest rate of these balances as of august  was 
the fair value of these cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately million as of august  interest on long term debt instruments is payable at fixed rates 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
during the quarter ended may   we entered into interest rate swap transactions under which we pay variable rates and we receive fixed rates 
the interest swaps effectively convert billion of our long term debt with a fixed interest rate into debt with a variable rate of interest 
our interest rate swaps have a total notional amount of billion as of august  the first million relates to our billion aces and expires on november  the second million relates to the million senior notes and expires on february  under each of these swap transactions  we pay an interest rate equal to the month libor rate plus a fixed spread 
as of august   the interest rates we paid were for the first million and for the second million 
in exchange  we receive fixed interest rates of on the first million and on the second million 
since our investment portfolio earns variable interest rates  the interest rate swaps allow us to partially offset the variable rate risk from the investment portfolio 
we may increase our variable rate exposure if there were to be material borrowings under our revolving lines of credit 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
our ability to effectively compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we hold a number of patents and other license rights 
these patents and license rights may not provide meaningful protection for our manufacturing processes and equipment innovations  which could result in litigation 
any resulting litigation could be lengthy and costly and could harm our financial condition 

table of contents we could become involved in intellectual property disputes 
in the past we have been and may from time to time continue to be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties 
in the event of an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop a non infringing alternative or to obtain licenses 
solectron may not be successful in developing such an alternative or obtaining a license on reasonable terms  if at all 
any litigation  even without merit  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on solectron s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
as a company in the electronics manufacturing services industry  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
although we have never sustained any significant loss as a result of non compliance with such regulations  any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant costs to comply with regulations 
the addition of numerous production and manufacturing service facilities as a result of our recent combination with c mac could generate additional risks that we have yet been unable to evaluate fully 
the investigations of the c mac facilities to date indicate that there are some contaminated sites for which c mac has been indemnified by third parties for any required remediation  sites for which there is a risk of the presence of contamination  and sites with some levels of contamination for which c mac may be liable and which may or may not ultimately require any remediation 
we have obtained environmental insurance to mitigate certain environmental liabilities posed by c mac s operations and facilities 
we believe  based on our current knowledge  that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean up that may be required at c mac facilities would not materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  the process of remediating contamination in soil and groundwater at the facilities is costly and cannot be estimated with high levels of confidence  and there can be no assurance that the costs of such activities would not harm our business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
our rating downgrades makes it more expensive for us to borrow money 
on december  moody s investor s service and standard poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba and bb  respectively  both with negative outlooks 
on march   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bb with a negative outlook 
on may   moody s investor services further downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba with a stable outlook 
these rating downgrades will increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving lines of credit  and may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
in addition  any further ratings downgrades may further negatively impact the price of our common stock and may have other negative implications on our business  many of which are beyond our control 
our obligations under lyons may cause dilution and reduction of earnings per share 
on may   we may become obligated to purchase  at the option of the holders  all or a portion of the outstanding lyons at a price of per note 
on may  we may become obligated to purchase  at the option of the holders  all or a portion of the outstanding lyons at a price of per note 
we have the option to pay the purchase price of lyons in cash or common stock or any combination thereof 
at the time of such election  it may be in the best interests of our shareholders to satisfy such obligation in cash  however  we may not have sufficient cash available and we may not be able to finance the required amounts on acceptable terms  if at all 
as a result  we may be required to satisfy such obligations with our common stock 
if we elect to pay the purchase price  in whole or part  in shares of our common stock  the number of shares of common stock to be delivered shall equal the purchase price divided by the average of the sale prices of the common stock for the five trading day period ending on the third business day prior to may  or may   as the case may be 
on each respective repurchase date the lyons or the lyons are convertible into common stock at a price of per share or shares per lyon in the case of the lyons or at a price of per share or shares per lyon  in the case of the lyons 
in the event that our stock price remains below per share at may  or below per share at may   as the case may be  we may have to issue a significant amount of additional shares to such holders 
accordingly  our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution and our earnings per share may be significantly reduced 
failure to attract and retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
losing the services of key personnel could harm us 
our business also depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could harm our operations 

table of contents our anti takeover defense provisions may deter potential acquirors and may depress our stock price 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of solectron 
these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock and impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions
