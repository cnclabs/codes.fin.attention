overview the company s revenues are largely based on the level of assets under management in its businesses as well as the level of fees associated with its various investment products 
growth in revenues generally depends on good investment performance  which increases assets under management by increasing the value of existing assets under management  contributing to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitating the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels 
growth in assets under management is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels  which is usually based on several factors  including performance and service 
historically  the company depended primarily on direct distribution of its products and services  but since has increasingly participated in third party distribution programs  particularly ntf programs 
a majority of the company s cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through these channels since fluctuations in financial markets also have a substantial effect on assets under management and results of operations  although the company s extensive use of variable compensation programs tends to moderate the effects of fluctuations in revenues 
the company s largest source of revenues is investment advisory fees  which are based on the amount of assets under management in its mutual funds and separate accounts 
advisory fees from the mutual funds are computed daily or weekly  while advisory fees from the separate accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter 
these revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions  financial market conditions and the fee structure for assets under management 
revenues derived from the equity oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios 
commission revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of mutual funds  institutional and high net worth clients as well as investment banking revenue  which consists of underwriting profits  selling concessions and management fees associated with underwriting activities 
distribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fees payable in accordance with rule b b of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues 
distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of assets under management and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by the company and through various distribution channels 
during  the b plans for of the open end mutual funds were restructured as compensation plans with annual fees set at basis points of average assets under management 
previously  these plans reimbursed the company for actual distribution expenses incurred  up to basis points of average assets under management 
compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to the officers  portfolio managers  sales  trading  research and all other staff members of the company 
other operating expenses include product distribution and promotion costs  clearing charges and fees for the company s brokerage operation  rental of office space and electronic data equipment and services  insurance  client servicing and other general and administrative operating costs 
interest and dividend income  interest expense and net gain loss from investments which includes both realized and unrealized gains is derived from proprietary investments of the company s capital in various public and private investments 
prior to the date of the reorganization  net gain loss from investments was derived primarily from the assets that were distributed to gfi and also included the results of gfi s hedging activities 
as part of an overall hedge of the risks associated with gfi s proprietary investment portfolio  gfi entered into transactions in domestic equity index contracts 
these financial instruments represented future commitments to sell an underlying index for specified amounts at specified future dates 
in connection with the formation transactions  the company distributed most of the proprietary investment portfolio which included the hedging activities to gfi 
as a result of the offering  the company became taxable as a c corporation for federal and state income tax purposes and paid taxes at an effective rate considerably higher than when gabelli asset management inc and certain of its subsidiaries were treated as subchapter s corporations

at december  and  the company had equity investments  including mutual funds largely invested in equity products  of million and million  respectively 
investments in mutual funds  million and million at december  and  respectively  generally lower market risk through the diversification of financial instruments within their portfolios

the company s exposure to interest rate risk results  principally  from its investment of excess cash in government obligations 
these investments are primarily short term in nature and the fair value of these investments generally approximates market value 
the company s revenues are largely driven by the market value of its assets under management and are therefore exposed to fluctuations in market prices of these assets  which are largely readily marketable equity securities

management fees earned on institutional and separate accounts  for any given quarter  are determined based on asset values on the last day of the preceding quarter 
any significant increases or decreases in market value of assets managed which occur on the last day of the quarter will result in a relative increase or decrease in revenues for the following quarter
