certain statements contained herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed herein are the following the failure of our markets to continue growing and expanding in the manner we anticipated  the failure of our customers to grow and expand as we anticipated  the effects of natural or other events beyond our control  the economic environment s effect on us and our customers  the growth of  acceptance of and the demand for our products and technologies in various markets and geographical regions  including cable  satellite  consumer electronics  retail and interactive tv and home automation  not materializing as we believed  our inability to add profitable complementary products which are accepted by the marketplace  our inability to continue to maintain our operating costs at acceptable levels through our cost containment efforts  our realization of tax benefits from various tax projects initiated from time to time  the continued strength of our balance sheet  our inability to continue selling our products or licensing our technologies at higher or profitable margins throughout and beyond  the failure of the various markets and industries to grow or emerge as rapidly or as successfully as we believed  the continued growth of the digital market  our inability to obtain orders or maintain our order volume with new and existing customers  the possible dilutive effect our stock option program may have on our earnings per share and stock price  our inability to continue to obtain adequate quantities of component parts or secure adequate factory production capacity on a timely basis  and other factors listed from time to time in our press releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  more information about risk factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled factors that may affect financial condition and future results in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  inventories  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on the sale of products when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment when the customer acceptance can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
for sales of new products or when the customer acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue and the related cost of goods sold are deferred until customer acceptance 
for the majority of our sales  recognition occurs when products are shipped 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly estimate returns and sales allowances  revenue could be overstated 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivables and historical bad debts  customer credit  current economic trends and changes in customer payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories consist of wireless control devices  including universal remote controls  wireless keyboards  antennas  and related component parts and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  and based on the carrying value of the asset being less than the undiscounted cash flows  we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we will cease to amortize approximately million of net unamortized goodwill 
we recorded approximately  of amortization during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we expect to complete our initial review during the second quarter of currently  we do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 

table of contents income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and international income taxes 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated income statements 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances quarterly 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
