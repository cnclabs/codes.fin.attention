item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year ending total assets were lower  in thousands primarily as a result of depreciation of fixed assets that exceeded purchases of new assets and amortization of intangible assets 
current assets declined as a result of reduced sales activity to slower paying international customers  offset by slightly higher ending inventories 
as a result  utmd continued to increase its total asset turns which had a favorable impact on return on equity roe 
net fixed assets declined because depreciation exceeded new purchases  and net intangible assets declined because of the amortization of goodwill and intellectual property 
year ending net intangible assets represented of total assets compared to at the end of in  asset turns are expected to benefit from projected sales growth while working capital remains about the same  excluding cash 
depreciation of fixed assets should continue to exceed purchases 
net intangible assets will not materially change  absent a new acquisition  because of adoption of fasb rule no 
discussed below 
cash accumulation which results after eliminating the line of credit balance in early  may reduce asset turns in the absence of a new acquisition or share repurchases 
management targets total asset turns at or higher than in order to not negatively affect roe 
the trends in net property  plant and equipment pp e and net pp e turns explain the trends in total assets 
net pp e after accumulated depreciation in the us decreased  while ireland decreased the current book value of consolidated pp e is of its purchase price 
management believes pp e to be in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity 
as a result  going forward  reported performance should be enhanced by slowing rates of depreciation expense and continuing higher pp e turns 
in june  the fasb financial accounting standards board changed the accounting for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
companies are required to adopt statement no 
in their fiscal year beginning after december  under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
income statement performance would only be affected in the case of impairment 
the amount of goodwill associated with an acquisition depends on the price paid for the acquisition 
large  actively acquisitive companies that use their stock as acquisition currency tend to pay higher valuations for acquisitions 
the goodwill on utmd s balance sheet is the result of two acquisitions in and which were made in cash at conservative valuations 
as of december   the goodwill on the balance sheet resulting from the two acquisitions had been reduced by from the acquisition price  as a result of utmd using previous gaap for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
the gesco neonatal products and cmi business acquired continue to be viable  and a vibrant part of utmd s overall business activities  representing of total sales activity in therefore  utmd does not expect its goodwill intangible assets to become impaired in the foreseeable future 
average inventory turns  although excellent at  decreased slightly in because of slightly lower sales and modestly higher average inventories compared to management expects to achieve its targeted average inventory turns in because sales should increase without the need for an increase in inventories 
year ending accounts receivable a r balances declined 
calculated average days in a r at based on q shipment activity were within management s objective 
aged a r over days from invoice date were about of total a r at year end  consistent with year end the company believes these older a r are collectible or within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was unchanged from year end because sales activity remained about the same as the prior year  cash generated from operations went to repay long term debt and the company consistently and effectively managed its other current assets and liabilities 
excluding the possibility of a new acquisition or additional share repurchases  utmd expects that working capital will increase as a result of cash generated from operations after bank debt is repaid 
b liabilities 
in the three years  utmd s total liabilities and total debt ratio have been driven by the timing of debt incurred for financing share repurchases  not in providing cash to operate its business 
except for the oregon building inherited as part of the cmi acquisition and a portion of its utah parking lot  utmd generally owns its pp e assets  dominated by its utah and ireland facilities  molds  manufacturing tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software 
at the end of  utmd s total debt ratio declined to from at the end of as utmd reduced its line of credit balance by million 
the company had previously borrowed million in july to complete a tender offer repurchase of million shares and another million in september to complete a tender offer repurchase of another million shares 
the cost of those repurchases including fees and transaction costs was share 
without additional significant share repurchases or a new acquisition  utmd will be able to eliminate its remaining bank debt in  yielding a total debt ratio less than by the end of the year 
results of operations 
a revenues 
total annual us domestic sales were essentially the same in as  while foreign international sales declined 
global consolidated sales declined 
utmd divides its domestic sales into two primary distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part another company s product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct sales represented compared to and in and respectively 
in each of the three years  us direct sales represented of global consolidated sales 
foreign sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to and in years and respectively 
of the foreign sales  were made in europe compared to and in and ireland operations shipped of foreign sales in us dollar terms in compared to in and in shipments from utmd ltd 
ireland were down in irish pound terms and down in us dollar terms compared to the prior year 
utmd groups its sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease  including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including gaining vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components for invasively monitoring blood pressure on a continuous basis with pressure transducer systems  along with other components and products sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and typically have differentiated product features protected by patents 
revenues by product category worldwide obstetrics product sales decreased and represented of total sales in obstetrics sales dollars were  in compared to  in and  in of the decline in total obstetrics sales  was from decreased utilization of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads by us hospital customers 
despite hospital concern  utmd agrees with acog the american college of obstetricians gynecologists that using vads remains the trained physician s best choice in many operative deliveries  and will continue its educational programs regarding appropriate indications and proper use of the procedure 
direct sales of the market leading iup catheter  intran r plus  declined under active competition from tyco kendallo ltp with its gpo contracts and softrans imitation of intran plus 
on january   in the united states federal district court for the district of utah  a twelve member jury rendered a verdict in favor of utmd that the tyco kendallo ltp softrans intrauterine pressure catheter infringes utmd s intran patent 
as part of any final judgment that may be entered in favor of utmd  the company intends to seek an injunction against the further marketing of kendallo ltp s infringing product 
in addition  cheaper  less clinically effective products continue to represent significant competition where administrators have primary say so in purchase decisions 
foreign obstetrics sales increased even though utmd s largest foreign distributor of obstetrics products went out of business early in the year 
worldwide gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales increased overall in  and represented of total revenues 
gyn es uro sales dollars were  in compared to  in and  in electrosurgery product sales increased  direct urology product sales increased  oem urology product sales decreased and sales of gynecology tools and instruments  including the endocurette  increased 
foreign sales in this category increased 
a number of utmd products in this fragmented category are differentiated  so sales should continue to grow as physicians learn more about them 
worldwide neonatal product sales increased  and represented of total sales 
neonatal product sales were  in compared to  in and  in in  utmd stopped distributing the bard access systems per q cath r neonatal picc  replacing it with utmd s newly developed picc nate tm 
utmd sales of per q cath were  and in  and respectively 
excluding per q cath  global neonatal product sales increased 
foreign neonatal product sales excluding per q cath increased 
worldwide blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales declined  and represented of total revenues 
sales of bpm and accessories products were  in compared to  in and  in the primary factor causing the overall decline was a decline in foreign deltran dpt sales 
utmd depends on the marketing efforts of its foreign distribution partners to differentiate deltran from other bpm products 
the decline in foreign sales of deltran dpt also explains the decline in utmd ltd 
sales activity since the ireland facility is responsible for manufacturing the product for foreign customers 
domestic oem sales in this category excluding sales to baxter increased 
utmd expects to be able continue to increase us oem sales of bpm products in  and is working with its foreign distributors to identify how it can help improve sales activity 
foreign sales of ob gyn and neonatal products increased and totaled  for as a result of this increase and the decline in dominant foreign bpm sales  the share of ob gyn and neonatal product sales increased to of foreign sales compared to in and in b gross profit 
utmd s average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus after costs of manufacturing  sterilizing  packaging  inspecting and shipping products cogs are subtracted from net revenues  was a company record compared to in and in royalties paid to others are also included in cogs 
utmd experienced a decline in lower margin foreign bpm product sales and an increase in higher margin domestic direct ob gyn sales  resulting in a favorable product mix 
manufacturing efficiencies for the year were excellent and certain license agreements expired reducing royalties paid to others 
with respect to gross profits in utmd s sales channels  oem sales are sales of utmd products that are marketed by other companies in conjunction with their product offerings  and are not sold under utmd s label 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem product sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur the significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overheads cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
utmd targets an average gpm greater than or equal to  which it believes is necessary to successfully support the significant operating expenses required in a highly complex and competitive marketplace 
management expects to achieve its gpm target again in expected favorable influences include growth in sales volume without a similar increase in manufacturing overhead expenses  a larger percentage of total sales from higher margin products and a continued emphasis on reengineering products to reduce costs 
expected unfavorable influences are continued competitive pressure on pricing  especially in foreign bpm sales  and higher wage rates 
utmd expects to retain average gpms in consistent with c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  research and development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
operating profit increased compared to the prior year 
in  operating profit was  compared to  in and  in utmd was able to substantially decrease operating expenses as a percentage of sales to in from in and in utmd s operating profit margin  operating profits divided by total sales  was a company record in the operating profit margin was in  compared to in and in looking forward to  assuming consistent gpms  holding r d and s m expenses consistent as a ratio of sales  utmd expects to achieve an even higher operating margin as a result of the changes in g a expenses described below 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly for us business activity 
s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions and processing orders 
contract administration fees paid to gpos are also included in s m expenses 
although revenues and gpms increase when the same unit sales are made by directly employed sales representatives in lieu of independent distributors or oem customers  s m operating expenses increase as an offset 
year s m expenses decreased to million from million in and million in as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in utmd management began to actively monitor and in detail address the productivity of its direct sales people in when direct domestic sales declined 
utmd was able to stop the domestic sales decline in with  lower s m expense compared to because of the time lag in realizing increased sales from better trained  more productive sales people  utmd expects some of the benefits of the changes made in to accrue to sales activity 
without including consideration for the impact of an ultimate favorable outcome to its patent infringement lawsuit with tyco kendallo ltp  utmd expects to achieve an increase in its domestic sales in for the first time since looking forward  utmd plans higher s m expenses during due to group purchasing organization fees  increased advertising expenses and new marketing initiatives  but intends to manage s m expenses to remain less than of total sales 
r d expenses in were of sales compared to of sales in and in in dollar terms  internal r d expenses were in  in and in new products developed in included an alternative break away introducer for picc nate  a picc repair kit  a new electrosurgical pen  a family of specialized microdissection needles named optimicro tm  and a family of picco catheters developed in collaboration with pulsion medical systems to be used in pulsion s proprietary semi invasive cardiac output monitoring systems 
the optimicro electrosurgery needles will be introduced to the marketplace in q in addition  a number of improvements to existing gesco neonatal products were completed  and continued collaborative work with manufacturing engineering led to improvements in manufacturing costs and techniques 
the manufacturing improvements are evident in utmd s substantially improved gpms 
in  utmd will opportunistically employ r d resources and invest r d expenditures where management anticipates it can get a significant return on its investments with future new product sales 
those expenses are most likely to be in the range of of sales 
g a operating expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  risk management and protection of intellectual property 
in addition to employing the personnel required to manage the preceding functions  g a expenses include outside legal counsel  independent accounting audit fees  k administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  business insurance costs  corporate contributions to charitable organizations  and goodwill amortization associated with acquisitions gwa 
g a expenses were  in   in and  in as a percent of sales  g a operating expenses were in  in and in gwa was in each of the three years  or about of sales 
because of the new fasb accounting rules regarding intangible assets  gwa will be zero in in addition  all three years included considerable litigation expenses relating to the patent infringement lawsuit with tyco kendallo ltp 
although additional litigation expense is required  including the actual trial in january and later responding to a probable tyco kendallo ltp appeal  utmd anticipates lower litigation expenses in taking these changes into consideration  utmd expects g a expenses in will be less than of total sales 
d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing unutilized property to others  interest earned and capital gains from investing the company s cash  and gains or losses from the sale of assets offset by non operating expenses like interest expenses and bank fees on the revolving line of credit 
non operating income was in  in and in royalties received were in  in and in royalties vary from period to period depending on the success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the applicable patents 
interest expenses and bank fees associated with the line of credit which reduce non operating income were in  in and in interest costs in were lower when compared to because both interest rates and the average loan balance were lower 
assuming current interest rates remain about the average for the whole year of and no new borrowing for acquisitions or share repurchases  management expects total non operating income to be about higher in than earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt were  in   in and  in ebt in were higher than in because of a record operating profit margin on only slightly lower sales combined with higher non operating income 
given the projections noted above including a new record operating profit margin year in on higher sales than in  and an increase in non operating income  management expects higher ebt in e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
net income increased to  in  from  in and  in net income did not increase in the same proportion as ebt or operating profit increased because utmd s effective tax rate increased 
the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  amount of exercised employee options which result in a tax benefit to the company  differences in distribution of state income taxes  differences in profitability of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  and other factors such as r d tax credits and actual litigation costs versus accrued expenses 
the gwa associated with the columbia medical  inc acquisition is not tax deductible 
in  since gwa will not be an expense  there will be a favorable impact on the average tax rate 
however  an offsetting unfavorable factor results from the fact that marginal tax rates increase by for ebt above million 
utmd expects its income tax rate to be about the same as  excluding consideration for a large damages award in the tyco kendallo ltp patent infringement lawsuit 
utmd is proud that its net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for years  and  respectively 
this profitability performance is the primary driver for utmd s return on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were a company record  up to from 
in eps in were 
when total sales were higher 
since  the combination of higher profitability and substantially fewer shares have created a substantial improvement in shareholder value in the form of higher eps 
in the four years since  utmd has increased eps at a rate of per year 
utmd management believes shareholder value is improved primarily by consistently increasing eps 
the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  and  shares in and  respectively 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
roe in was compared to in and in this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support growth in revenues without issuing more stock 
record profitability and higher utilization of assets offset reduced financial leverage in creating an outstanding roe result 
in utmd s opinion  achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
management s goal is to consistently achieve roe in excess of 
utmd s roe has averaged per year over the last years 
although the accumulation of cash in the absence of share repurchases or acquisitions could reduce total asset turns  and the elimination of long term debt would reduce financial leverage that enhances roe  management expects to be able to achieve its roe objective again in primarily by accomplishing another record year in profitability 
liquidity and capital resources 
a cash flows 
cash and equivalent balances were at the end of utmd effectively maintains zero balance sweep cash account balances that minimize the line of credit balance  except for amounts held to meet operating requirements in ireland and separate physical reserves set aside for litigation expenses and other contractual commitments where cash has been committed 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in compared to  in and  in the reason that the cash provided was about the same in as was that the increase in net income in when working capital remained consistent with the prior year  was about the same in magnitude as the working capital decrease in the prior year when net income was lower 
in  utmd s net income was comparable with  so the million higher amount of cash provided in compared to resulted essentially from a million reduction in receivables and inventories 
the company expended during for investing activities  comprised entirely of purchases of property and equipment 
during  the company used a total of to purchase property and equipment and intangible assets  offset by that utmd received for selling used equipment it had replaced or no longer needed 
essentially all of the utmd used in for investing activities was for purchases of property and equipment 
in  utmd received from issuing  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and repurchased  shares of stock at a cost of employee option exercises were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options and paid  to repurchase  shares 
in  utmd received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options and paid  to repurchase  shares 
during  utmd made repayments of  on its note payable while receiving in proceeds from the note 
in  utmd made loan repayments of  and received  in proceeds from the note 
in the company made loan repayments of  and received  in proceeds from the note 
the and loan proceeds were used to pay for utmd share repurchases as the result of tender offers through which utmd bought a combined million of its shares at a total cost of  management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will allow the liquidity needed to finance growth plans and repay debt 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to the capital expenditures  utmd plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock remains undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
utmd plans to use any cash not needed for the above pursuits during to eliminate the line of credit balance 
the revolving credit line will continue to be used for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time 
other financial measures ebitda ebt  plus depreciation and amortization expenses  plus interest expense is a term used for measuring a company s ability to generate cash from its operations without regard for changes in working capital  cash consumed for fixed asset purchases  its cost of borrowing or income tax burden 
utmd s ebitda in was million  or as a ratio of sales 
utmd s ebitda has averaged of sales over the last five years 
the extraordinarily strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of outstanding operating profit performance  a substantial non cash charge to earnings from amortization of goodwill and royalty income from others use of utmd s technology 
management projects performance factors will remain intact for that will allow approximately million again in ebitda 
please note that ebitda is not defined or described by generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  it is not prepared in accordance with gaap  is not a measure of liquidity  and is not a measure of operating results 
however  the components of ebitda are prepared in accordance with gaap  and utmd believes that ebitda is an important measure of the company s operating performance and financial well being 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to realize improved results from initiatives to expand sales activity  continue outstanding operating performance  and set new company records for profitability as a percent of sales  sustain the patent infringement verdict and recover damages  and actively look for new acquisitions to build a platform for continued growth 
as a first indication of improving sales activity  q was the first quarter in eight consecutive calendar quarters that utmd achieved positive revenue growth relative to the same quarter in the prior year 
the following factors provide optimism that will demonstrate renewed top line growth the direct us sales team has been revitalized as a resource for achieving utmd s objectives to help clarify clinician needs  responsively provide valuable solutions for those needs and assure timely support for clinical customers use of utmd s solutions 
key us hospital accounts that were converted back to utmd s flagship products during will add significant business activity simply by virtue of being back purchasing products during a full year 
utmd terminated its last speciality distributor  on which it relied for promotional sales activities  effective not including national jit distributors that continue on request of hospital customers to perform inventory functions 
the terminated distributor was responsible for of total domestic direct sales in if utmd can retain the prior business activity  sales will increase because direct customer prices for the same products will be higher than utmd s previous wholesale prices to the distributor 
historically  utmd s direct sales representatives have consistently been able not only to retain prior business activity but substantially increase it after the termination of a regional distributor 
utmd expects that new products that did not materially contribute to performance will make a more material contribution in  eg  picc nate  endocurette and optimicro needles 
all offer important clinical benefits 
internationally  specialty ob gyn product sales grew rapidly in and should continue the momentum in the new pulsion picco catheter should materially add to foreign sales if pulsion and its marketing partners prove successful in gaining broader acceptance of the advanced method of measuring cardiac output 
utmd achieved some success in in gaining more oem interest in utilizing its capabilities  and expects some of those projects may begin to come to fruition in of course  utmd feels strongly about the merits of its infringement claims regarding its patented flagship product  intran plus 
the lawsuit has been in process for five years  and has required a huge commitment of limited utmd resources  which negatively affected past performance 
in utmd s opinion  copying strategies work as a business approach for large commodity oriented not innovative companies because small specialized single product companies do not command the financial resources to fight a protracted complex legal battle in the courts to defend their technologies 
utmd s employees are gratified that the utah federal district court jury found that utmd s patent was valid and that graphic controls  now tyco kendallo ltp  infringed it 
since tyco kendallo ltp introduced softrans their copy of intran plus in  which was found to have infringed the utmd patent  they have significantly diminished utmd s market share aided by their gpo contracts for broad commodity product lines and greater sales and marketing resources 
tyco kendallo ltp appears to have taken about of utmd s previous iupc business 
the jury awarded utmd million in damages  representing an estimate of the profits that utmd has lost to date 
if tyco appeals as they have indicated they will  utmd will work to protect the verdict  although we expect a significant struggle based on the last five years experience with the amount of money and lawyers that tyco will deploy 
given the uncertainty of a complex legal process  utmd will reserve its projection of the significant impact that an ultimate victory would have on its business until the case is finally closed 
however  the appeal process will not require new discovery or new testimony by witnesses  and therefore should be completed before the end of utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from large commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
our passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus  and does not seek to become big as a primary motivation 
we just want to do an excellent job in meeting our customers needs  and provide our shareholders with excellent returns 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represents significant clinical benefits as well as minimal total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product  period 
utmd is hopeful that recent federal congressional attention on the activities of gpo s will begin to shine a brighter light on their anti competitive practices that are not in the best interest of us patients or their physicians 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed new business partners 
in  utmd expects its ireland subsidiary  which shipped only of foreign sales in because of weak bpm product sales  to improve from its performance and make a more important contribution to utmd s overall performance 
we expect the oregon operation to continue the excellent oem performance it demonstrated in in  utmd again demonstrated a high positive cash flow reflected by record ebitda performance of of sales  managing its working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures substantially below its rate of depreciation of existing assets 
enough time has passed allowing reduction of debt that utmd s balance sheet is back in shape for another acquisition without diluting shareholders interest by issuing more stock 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies that will enhance its specialist focus 
when we acquire a company  it probably will be for cash  with the idea that we will be able to retain key resources that helped make it successful  and not gut the acquired company simply to gain financial benefits 
because current market values seem closer to acquisition values that will allow realistic accretive results  utmd intends to increase its acquisition search activity in utmd s technologies are current  and ideas often leading  but we believe in the old fashioned approach of building a long term stable business that will achieve predictable future results allowing job security for our employees who are diligent in their work  consistent returns for our shareholders and continued excellent services for customers who depend on us 
rather than devoting limited resources to a large public relations effort promoting the company s stock  we focus our resources on company business 
over the last four years  utmd has achieved some significant accomplishments compounded eps growth of per year  repurchase of of the ownership of the company net of all option exercises for million million net shares at an average cost of per share including commissions and other repurchase costs  two acquisitions costing million which accounted for of total sales in  and  an apparent successful effort defending the patent rights of utmd s flagship product technology and core franchise of utmd s market identity  plus a million lost profits award 
looking back  utmd s eps were up in  and the ending share price was up relative to the end of the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia were all down   and respectively 
with eps of  utmd s year end price to earnings ratio per was still only  suggesting that a combination of per expansion to closer to the market average and continued increase in eps performance could again provide exceptional shareholder returns in accounting policy changes 
in july  sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were issued 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
it requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
sfas is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after december  according to the requirements of sfas  the company will no longer amortize the goodwill associated with its and acquisitions and will begin to regularly assess its goodwill for impairment 
the book value of goodwill related to these acquisitions at december  was in thousands  the fasb recently issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement  which amends sfas no 
 establishes accounting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires all entities with a legal obligation to retire tangible  long lived assets to record the retirement costs as a liability on an entity s balance sheet 
the effective date for this statement is june  management does not believe the adoption of statement will have any material effect on its financial statements since the company does not hold title to any tangible assets which would have to be retired under a legal obligation 
the fasb recently issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the new guidance resolves implementation issues related to fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe the adoption of statement will have any material effect on its financial statements since goodwill is no longer required to be allocated to long lived assets when testing for impairment 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk prior to january   the company had manufacturing operations  including related assets  in ireland denominated in irish pounds  and sold products under agreements denominated in various western european currencies 
the irish pound and other currencies are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond the control of utmd 
the exchange rate for the irish pound was  
and 
per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
please see note  page f on january   utmd converted its irish operations and assets to the euro currency  consistent with conversion of ireland and many other western european countries to the new common euro currency 
utmd manages its foreign currency risk without separate hedging transactions by converting currencies as transactions occur
