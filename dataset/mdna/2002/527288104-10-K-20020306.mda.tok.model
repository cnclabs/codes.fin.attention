the company s investment in automobile loans was  and  at december  and  respectively

as of december   the principal amount of fidei s remaining euro denominated outstanding debt  all of which is non recourse to the company  was   euros

the company s debt instruments require maintenance of minimum tangible net worth  limit distributions to shareholders and limit indebtedness  as defined in the agreements

the  commitment expiration in the less than one year period results from actual principal payments received under the berkadia loan that were used to reduce the balance due under berkadia s financing 
to the extent that future principal payments are received under the berkadia loan prior to maturity  such amounts will be used to paydown the berkadia financing and the remaining  guarantee will expire at an earlier date than reflected above 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries have or have had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes  the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the tax loss carryforwards  the company s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision that is charged to expense 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was  or of the related outstanding loan receivable balance of  the allowance for loan losses is an amount that the company believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of existing loans based on the company s evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
factors considered by the company include actual experience  current economic trends  aging of the loan portfolio and collateral value 
during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses generally increase 
these periods may also be accompanied by decreased demand and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default 
in addition  incentives offered by the automobile industry on new cars affect the supply of used cars and the value the company may realize upon sale of repossessed automobiles 
the allowance is based on judgments and assumptions and the ultimate loss may differ 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period 
similarly  if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
in addition  the internal revenue service irs is in the process of concluding its audit of the company s consolidated federal income tax returns for the years through the irs has issued notices of proposed adjustments that  if sustained  would result in approximately  of tax  plus interest 
the company is contesting these proposed adjustments 
the company believes that it is adequately reserved for this exposure 
the company accounts for its investment in berkadia under the equity method of accounting 
although the company has no cash investment in berkadia  the company has a contingent liability resulting from its guarantee of of the third party financing provided to berkadia 
the total amount of the company s guarantee is  as of february  while the company does not expect that berkadia will suffer losses resulting in the company having to fund its guarantee obligation  actual results could differ 
as of december   the carrying amount of the company s investment in the mining properties of mk gold was approximately  the recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of mk gold s mining project at the las cruces copper deposit in the pyrite belt of spain 
mining will be subject to obtaining required permits currently underway  obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project  engineering and construction 
recently  the market price of copper has been depressed  reflecting generally weak global economic conditions 
the amount of financing which can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper 
in addition  the actual price of copper and the operating cost of the mine will affect the recoverability of this asset 
based on the current status of the project and mk gold s estimate of future financing costs and future cash flows  the company believes the asset is recoverable 
actual results could differ 
banking and lending finance revenues  which reflect the level and mix of consumer instalment loans  increased in each of the last two years due to greater average loans outstanding 
average loans outstanding were   and  for  and  respectively 
although finance revenues increased in as compared to  pre tax results declined primarily due to a larger provision for loan losses  changes in market values of interest rate swaps  higher interest paid on interest rate swaps  charges recorded in connection with the company s decision to stop originating new subprime automobile loans and to consolidate all operations in salt lake city  and higher interest expense due to the increased customer banking deposits through september of in  the banking and lending segment s provision for loan losses increased  as compared to the prior year 
this increase primarily reflects higher net charge offs  for which the company believes a weaker economy and increased bankruptcies were contributing factors  and an increase in the rates used by the company to establish the allowance for loan losses in recognition of its increased loss experience 
in an effort to reduce losses  the company exited certain states and automobile dealer relationships with historically higher loan losses  but losses continued to increase throughout this loss experience  combined with the increasingly difficult competitive environment  resulted in the company s decision in september to stop originating any new subprime automobile loans 
the company will continue to service the remaining automobile portfolio as well as originate other products  although it is anticipated that new loan originations will be substantially less than originations previously generated in the subprime automobile portfolio 
the company will also seek to acquire loan portfolios that meet its credit criteria if these portfolios can be purchased on attractive terms 
pre tax results for the banking and lending segment for also reflect  of charges primarily resulting from a mark to market loss on its interest rate swaps 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits 
although the company believes that these derivative financial instruments serve as economic hedges  they do not meet certain effectiveness criteria under sfas  and therefore are not accounted for as hedges 
in an effort to increase operating efficiencies  the company has filed an application with the occ to merge aib and aif 
although the company anticipates that the merger will be approved during the first quarter of  no assurance can be given that it will be approved 
as a result of its decision to stop originating new subprime automobile loans and this planned merger  the company has been consolidating all operations in salt lake city 
pre tax results for the banking and lending segment include  of charges related to this consolidation  primarily resulting from the closing of aib s indianapolis office 
the increase in finance revenues in as compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of the operations of a subprime lender and increased new loan originations 
pre tax results declined in as compared to primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses  higher interest expense due to increased customer banking deposits and higher interest rates thereon  and higher salaries expense as a result of the acquisition 
the higher loan losses were principally caused by the poor performance of the subprime automobile portfolio acquired in  for which the actual collection experience was less than expected  a larger amount of loans outstanding  including the purchased portfolio  that were reaching the age of peak losses  generally twelve to eighteen months after origination  the increased loan originations and a weaker economy 
foreign real estate fidei s revenues and pre tax income declined in as compared to principally due to decreased rent income due to a smaller base of remaining real estate properties and decreased gains from sales of real estate properties 
during  fidei sold real estate properties  resulting in pre tax gains of  properties remain at december  the company expects to complete the sale of fidei s real estate holdings during pre tax results for also reflected lower interest expense as a result of the maturity and early extinguishment of certain debt  lower depreciation expense due to the reduction in real estate properties and lower selling  general and other expenses  which were partially offset by a charge of  related to value added taxes assessed for a sold property 
fidei s revenues declined in as compared to primarily due to decreased rent income from the smaller base of remaining real estate properties and decreased gains from sales of real estate properties  partially offset by increased investment income 
during  fidei sold real estate properties resulting in pre tax gains of  pre tax results for also reflected lower depreciation expense due to the reduction in real estate properties and lower selling  general and other expenses 
domestic real estate the reduction in revenues and pre tax income from domestic real estate in as compared to the prior year was principally due to the foreclosure gains recorded in and less gains from property sales  net of costs 
during  the company sold residential sites and a school site resulting in pre tax gains of  at its largest domestic real estate investment  a master planned community project located in san diego county 
the increase in revenues and pre tax income relating to domestic real estate in as compared to primarily resulted from greater net gains from sales of various properties and  of gains recorded upon the foreclosure of certain shopping centers 
during  the first residential lot sales occurred at the company s project located in san diego county  residential sites were sold resulting in pre tax gains of  manufacturing manufacturing revenues  gross profit and pre tax results for the plastics division declined in as compared to of the  decline in manufacturing revenues in  the most significant reductions were in the consumer products market  which declined by  this decline was primarily due to a customer for the asian market no longer using one of the company s products and a lower than anticipated demand for consumer dust wipe products 
in addition  increased competition in the agriculture  home furnishing and packaging markets and customer inventory reductions in the construction and certain industrial markets also contributed to the reduction in sales in gross profit for declined primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in sales and higher fixed costs related to the belgium manufacturing facility 
the decline in pre tax income in was partially offset by a  gain resulting from a contract termination payment received from a customer 
for  manufacturing revenues for the plastics division modestly increased to  as compared to  for gross profit and pre tax income for the plastics division declined slightly in primarily due to higher raw material costs 
other investment and other income declined in as compared to in part from income recognized in totaling  consisting of foreclosure gains from certain domestic real estate properties  a prepayment penalty related to certain promissory notes and a gain from the sale of a corporate owned aircraft 
in addition  investment and other income declined in due to decreased gains from sales of real estate properties and rental income related to fidei  decreased gains from sales of various domestic real estate properties  and a reduction in revenues related to mk gold 
such decreases were partially offset by a gain of  from the sale of the company s investment in two inactive insurance companies and increased revenues from the company s oil and gas operations 
investment and other income declined in as compared to primarily due to gains recognized in from the sale of caja de ahorro y seguro sa  the sperry hutchinson company  inc  its russian joint venture with pepsico  inc  and an equity interest in an associated company 
investment and other income also decreased in due to a reduction in investment income  resulting primarily from the payment of the dividend and debt repurchases in and decreased rent income and gains from sales of real estate properties related to fidei 
this decrease was partially offset by increased net gains from sales and foreclosures of various domestic real estate properties  a prepayment penalty related to certain promissory notes  and revenues relating to mk gold  which the company began consolidating in the fourth quarter of net securities gains losses for include pre tax security gains related to the company s investments in fidelity national financial  inc  and jordan telecommunication products  inc 
for  the company recognized  of losses from its equity investments in associated companies as compared to  of income for the loss in was primarily due to a loss of  representing the company s share of the loss recorded by berkadia 
the company s share of berkadia s loss consists of the following in thousands net interest spread on the berkadia loan of total  amortization of berkadia loan discount related to cash fees of total  amortization of berkadia loan discount related to finova stock of total  share of finova loss under equity method of total  equity in loss of associated companies berkadia  as more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  berkadia s initial investment in the fnv shares and the berkadia loan are determined based upon the relative fair values of the securities received in exchange for the funds transferred to finova 
the fair value assigned to the fnv shares is based upon the trading price of finova s common stock on the day the fnv shares were received  was far in excess of finova s net worth and is inconsistent with the company s view that the finova common stock has a very limited value 
subsequent to acquisition  and principally as a result of the terrorist attacks on september   berkadia recorded its share of finova s losses in an amount that reduced berkadia s investment in finova s common stock to zero 
at december   the book value of the company s equity investment in berkadia was negative  the negative carrying amount was due to berkadia s distribution of the berkadia loan fees and its recognition of its share of finova s losses under the equity method of accounting 
this loss recognized by berkadia is a non cash loss that will be reversed over the term of the berkadia loan 
as a result of the application of these accounting rules  the negative carrying amount of the company s investment in berkadia effectively represents an unamortized discount on the berkadia loan  which will be amortized to income over the term of the loan 
the company s loss related to berkadia was partially offset by income from other equity investments  the most significant of which related to jpof ii 
the company recognized income from its investment in jpof ii of  and  in and  respectively 
equity in income losses of associated companies increased in as compared to primarily due to income related to jpof ii 
the increase in interest expense for as compared to primarily reflects increased customer banking deposits and higher interest rates thereon  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to debt repurchases in salaries expense in primarily reflects decreased expenses related to lower bonus expense 
salaries expense in reflects an increase in employees  primarily at the banking and lending segment 
selling  general and other expenses increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and charges recorded in connection with consolidating the banking and lending operations  and the value added taxes assessed on fidei  all as described above  partially offset by lower expenses related to mk gold 
the increase in selling  general and other expenses in as compared to principally reflects higher provisions for loan losses at the banking and lending segment  and expenses related to mk gold 
income taxes for reflect a benefit of  for the favorable resolution of income tax contingencies 
income taxes for reflect a benefit of  from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards  of which  was previously included in the valuation allowance 
income taxes for also reflect a benefit of  for the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax contingencies 
property and casualty insurance discontinued operation in december  upon approval by the company s board of directors to commence an orderly liquidation of the empire group  the company classified as discontinued operations the property and casualty insurance operations of the empire group 
the empire group had historically engaged in commercial and personal lines of property and casualty insurance  principally in the new york metropolitan area 
the empire group will only accept new business that it is obligated to accept by contract or new york insurance law  it will not engage in any other business activities except for its claims runoff operations 
the voluntary liquidation is expected to be substantially complete by the company has written down its investment in the empire group to its estimated net realizable value based on expected operating results and cash flows during the liquidation period  which indicate that the company is unlikely to realize any value once the liquidation is complete 
accordingly  the company recorded a  pre tax charge as loss on disposal of discontinued operations to fully write off its investment 
while this estimated net realizable value represents management s best estimate  the amount the company will ultimately realize could be  but is not expected to be  greater 
the company has no obligation to contribute additional capital to the empire group 
excluding the loss on disposal  the empire group recorded pre tax losses from operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the empire group s net earned premiums were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  these decreases resulted from the empire group s efforts to exit unprofitable lines of business and to terminate its relationships with unprofitable agents 
the losses recorded by the empire group were significantly impacted by the recognition of adverse reserve development recorded during each of the last three years as described below 
during  the empire group recorded adverse loss reserve development of  in addition  during  the empire group expensed  of deferred policy acquisition costs  as their recoverability from premiums and related investment income was no longer anticipated 
during  the empire group increased its reserve estimates for its commercial package policies lines of business  primarily due to increases in severity of liability claims for accident years and prior 
the empire group has exposure for third party liability claims in many of its lines of insurance 
during  there were several settlements and court decisions on third party liability cases for amounts that are greater than the industry s or the empire group s historical experience for similar claims  which had formed the basis for the empire group s estimated loss reserves 
while many of these decisions are being appealed  these results may signal a change in the judicial environment in the empire group s marketplace 
accordingly  the empire group has increased its loss reserve estimate by  due to an estimated increase in severity for these exposures 
reserve increases in also resulted from unfavorable development principally in automobile lines of business for the through accident years  primarily relating to personal injury protection coverage pip and in its workers compensation lines of insurance 
the empire group believes that the increased loss estimates for pip are consistent with recent trends in the industry  and has increased loss reserves for all automobile lines by  for in addition  the empire group also increased its reserve for loss adjustment expenses by  as a result of the increases to its loss reserves and an increase in future overhead costs which will be allocated to settle claims currently incurred 
during the period between and  the empire group entered into certain retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts covering substantially all lines of business  except workers compensation 
under these contracts  the empire group paid the reinsurer provisional premiums that are subject to adjustment based on subsequent loss development 
ceded premiums accrued under these contracts reduce both net written and earned premiums during the period the retrospective reinsurance premiums are accrued 
if additional unfavorable loss development emerges in future periods  the empire group may be required to accrue additional retrospective reinsurance premiums 
as a consequence of its reserve increases  the empire group reduced premiums and pre tax profits in by  to recognize reinsurance premiums due for and prior years under retrospectively rated reinsurance agreements 
during  the empire group recorded adverse loss reserve development of  principally in the through accident years 
this development was attributable to an increase in the severity of pip claims and an increase in the frequency of liability claims in the private passenger automobile line  an increase in the frequency of liability claims in the commercial automobile line  an increase in the frequency and severity of pip claims in the assigned risk automobile line  and an increase in the severity of certain liability claims in the commercial package policies lines of business 
the increases in severity and frequency of claims in automobile lines of business  particularly with respect to pip claims  are consistent with emerging industry trends in the new york city marketplace 
in addition  the empire group increased its estimate for loss adjustment expenses by  as a result of the decision to outsource a significant amount of claim handling functions in claim files for workers compensation  automobile no fault and automobile and other liability claims were outsourced at a cost greater than the reserves previously recorded to handle the claims internally 
the empire group has also increased its reserve estimate for claims handled internally 
during  the empire group recorded adverse loss reserve development of  principally due to an increase in severity of accident year losses in the assigned risk automobile and voluntary private passenger automobile lines  and accident year losses in certain classes of the commercial automobile line 
as a result  the empire group increased its reserves by  for assigned risk automobile   for voluntary private passenger automobile and  for commercial automobile lines

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio  its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale  and consequently  is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders equity 
included in the company s investment portfolio are fixed income securities  which comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at december  these fixed income securities are primarily rated investment grade or are us governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately years at december  the company s fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company s investment portfolio also includes its investment in wmig  carried at its aggregate market value of  this investment is approximately of the company s total investment portfolio  and its value is subject to change if the market value of the wmig stock rises or falls 
at december   fixed income securities comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of years 
at december  and  the company s portfolio of trading securities was not material 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt and the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the company 
generally  the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall  and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
the company s banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature or reprice in specified periods 
the principal objectives of the company s banking and lending asset liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs
