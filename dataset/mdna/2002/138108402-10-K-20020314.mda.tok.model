results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues overall revenues decreased by  in fiscal over fiscal revenues in the training and consulting segment reflected a net decrease of  
this decrease however was the result of a significant reduction in revenues from existing subsidiaries of  primarily calc canterbury  offset by the addition of revenues from the newly acquired usertech subsidiary totaling  during the fourth quarter of fiscal there were a number of factors which contributed to the revenue reduction from existing subsidiaries primarily calc canterbury in this business segment 
the events of september  in new york city had a significant effect on total revenues in the fourth quarter of the year 
training in the metro new york city area came to a virtual standstill while the businesses affected by the tragedy struggled to cope with the devastation 
many classes were cancelled  and there was very little sales activity for the last three months of the year 
several of our largest customers were located at ground zero 
consulting assignments were delayed or cancelled due to the chaos in and around new york city 
the company s business interruption insurance policy provided limited relief to the economic impact of the terrorist attacks 
proceeds from the policy netted the company approximately  which was received in the first quarter of fiscal even prior to september   the economic downturn in the technology sector had softened demand for certain training and consulting products during several large clients had reduced their training budgets in the second canterbury consulting group  inc 
form k half of the year in response to their own fiscal situations 
new software rollouts were delayed and application and technical training revenues suffered during the year as a result 
as the first quarter of fiscal progresses  the company is seeing signs that the level of activity by our customers is beginning to improve 
the new york city client base is regrouping and the amount of training and consulting opportunities are increasing 
the company is working to expand its sales presence in this market to capture the apparent pent up demand caused by the soft fourth quarter of fiscal also  the acquisition of usertech provides the company with even more expertise in distance learning 
all of the company s training subsidiaries are beginning to work together to blend existing course content with e learning delivery capabilities 
for clients in and around new york city  as well as the rest of the world  the company will have the capacity to provide a distance learning solution to those who may choose not to attend classroom training in the future 
revenues in the value added hardware reseller segment decreased by  in fiscal versus again much of this shortfall occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year as overall technology spending slowed 
the reduction in sales volume was more than offset by a significant increase in gross profit from these sales 
margins increased to in fiscal from in  as the sales staff was more selective in making proposals coupled with very strong manufacturer rebate program participation 
revenues in the technical staffing segment increased by  in fiscal due to the fact that the acquisition of dmi canterbury occurred part way through fiscal  and did not contribute for a full year 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased by  in fiscal versus gross profit on service revenue declined from in fiscal to in due to the effects of the revenue decline from training and consulting coupled with a fairly high fixed cost delivery component 
product margins  which include hardware and software sales of the company increased to in from a level of in fiscal consolidated gross margins for the company increased to in versus in fiscal selling expense increased by  in fiscal over  of the increase was due to selling expense incurred by usertech after the september  acquisition 
the balance of the difference can be attributed to the fact that dmi  which was acquired in august   had a full year of operations in fiscal versus only four months in general and administrative expense increased by  
again a portion of the increase can be accounted for by the addition of usertech  and the incremental cost associated with a full year of operations for dmi 
other components of the increase include increased provision for bad debt of  increased salaries of  and other miscellaneous non cash corporate write offs approximating  which were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 
canterbury consulting group  inc 
form k also during fiscal the company recorded  of goodwill impairment charges 
 of this charge was reflected in the second quarter of the year and the balance was recorded in the fourth quarter 
management made the decision to treat the carrying value of goodwill conservatively 
dmi canterbury goodwill was written down to total charge of  due to the uncertainty in the technical staffing marketplace caused by the dot com bust and the softening of spending in this business segment 
the net goodwill related to the acquisition of calc canterbury training and consulting segment totaling  was also written off 
the lingering current effects of september  as well as the uncertainty of future business growth due to the change in business climate surrounding new york city are the major reasons for this impairment charge 
finally  the net goodwill of  resulting from the acquisition of atm canterbury software development segment was also written off 
recent operating results may be indicative that the book value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
management believes that these impairment charges reflect the net carrying value of goodwill on the november  balance sheet under a conservative valuation approach due to the current operating losses and uncertain business environment of calc canterbury  dmi canterbury and atm canterbury 
all goodwill impairment expense is reflected under corporate in the segment reporting footnote 
interest expense was reduced by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal strong operating cash flow allowed for reductions in borrowings related to the usertech acquisition and lower floating interest rates provided expense relief during the year 
other expense of  was comprised of two components 
first a charge of  was recorded during the fourth quarter related to the impairment of an investment available for sale 
the approximately  shares of the publicly traded company were accepted by the company from until early as payment for services delivered to this start up organization 
current market value coupled with the organization s poor balance sheet gave rise to the need for this charge in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of the company also recorded an investment impairment charge of  for another security held for sale 
also reflected in other expenses for fiscal is a loss of  related to the sale of real estate during the second quarter of the year 
fiscal results of operations included many non cash  non recurring charges to the income statement 
the following list will summarize these charges goodwill impairment  investment impairment  loss on sale of land  reserve for uncollectible accounts  debt issuance cost write off  total  if these non cash  non recurring charges were eliminated from the fiscal canterbury consulting group  inc 
form k statement of operation  the company would have shown a pretax profit of approximately  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased by  in fiscal over fiscal the majority  of this increase is attributable to the revenues generated for a full fiscal year by usc canterbury  which was acquired in october  the revenues for the other existing subsidiaries remained fairly constant with technical services consulting revenues making up the difference in revenue increase for fiscal over the previous year 
the company continues to develop alternative revenue streams such as on line learning  technical staffing  technical services and web development 
it is believed that these additional revenue streams will become more significant in fiscal and beyond 
costs and expenses costs and expenses increased by  in fiscal over the previous year 
again  the most significant portion of this increase  is attributable to costs associated with usc canterbury 
while gross profit increased from  in fiscal to   gross profit percentage declined from in fiscal to in fiscal this was due to the change in product mix from year to year 
product revenue  as a percent of total revenue  increased from in to in fiscal product revenue had an associated gross profit of  while service revenue gross profit for fiscal was 
the full year contribution of usc canterbury  a value added reseller  again contributed to this shift 
selling expense increased by  
the increase was a result of the increase in selling expense for a full year of usc canterbury activity  as compared to only one and a half months in fiscal general and administrative expense increased by  in fiscal over fiscal  of the increase was due to the additional expense of usc canterbury for a full year 
 related to the expense for dmi  which was added to the business during the third quarter of fiscal other income for fiscal increased by  over fiscal the net increase was primarily due to recognized other income of  related to the receipt of stock for assisting in raising capital for a related party
