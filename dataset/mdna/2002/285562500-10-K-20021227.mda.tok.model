critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred taxes  reserve for doubtful accounts  goodwill amortization  capitalization of software costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
all processing and transaction revenues are recognized at the time the transactions are processed by the customer 
processing and transaction revenues are principally based on the number of transactions processed and a percentage of dollar volume processed 
terminal sales are recorded when product is shipped and title transferred to the customer 
reserve for doubtful accounts 
the company established a reserve for doubtful accounts equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts 
the company s estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of account receivable 
it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of the reserve for doubtful accounts will change from time to time 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
research and development expense 
expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred 
such expenditures amounted to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year goodwill amortization 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over tangible and other intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations and is being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  issued in june  requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting unit for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas also requires companies to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
the company is required to adopt these statements effective the first quarter of fiscal the company has completed the step goodwill impairment test  as prescribed by sfas  utilizing discounted cash flow analysis for the check services reporting unit that has goodwill 
the results of this analysis indicate potential goodwill impairment for this reporting unit 
the company has begun  but not completed  step measurement of the impairment loss  by evaluating the fair value of the check services business segment through discounted cash flow models and other analytical means 
the company expects to record any impairment loss as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of capitalization of software costs 
the costs of purchased and internally developed software used to provide services to customers or internal administrative expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or estimated useful life 
under the provisions of statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  the company capitalizes software costs when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its financial statements and the results of its operations

processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense and transaction and check processing expense  increased for the year  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase reflects a increase in processing and transaction revenues for the year  as well as the higher costs of processing 
gross margin from processing and transaction services decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin was due to a combination of factors such as higher personnel and infrastructure costs  increased costs paid to a third party service provider  the departure of several higher volume high margin credit card merchants  and a lower rate charged to u haul as a result of a contract negotiation

the increase is due to the million long term note portion of the legal settlement expense for premiere lifestyles international corporation  which carries an interest rate 
interest income declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a decline in interest rates and lower average cash balances 
effective tax rate 
benefit for income taxes of  in fiscal was due to the operating loss incurred of  the company s effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal and a tax provision rate of for fiscal see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for further explanation of the income tax expense and a reconciliation of reported income taxes to the amount utilizing the statutory rate

segment results bankcard and transaction processing 
bankcard processing and transaction revenue increased  from  in fiscal to  for fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to an approximately increase in bankcard processing volume as compared to last year and was the result of the company s successful marketing programs  including the merchantamerica web offerings and other sales programs 
the increase in bankcard processing revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenue as a result of a rate reduction offered to u haul  a major transaction processing customer  and the loss of several high volume  high margin merchants 
in fiscal  the bankcard and transaction processing segment generated operating income of  or of associated revenues  as compared to  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in operating income is attributable to a  increase in research and development expense  a  increase in inventory allowance and a  decrease in other revenue 
additionally  gross margin decreased due to the departure of several high margin merchants combined with higher overall operating costs 
the company implemented a rate increase in october to its credit card processing merchants  which is expected to offset the higher operating costs and to improve the gross margin from credit card processing activities in fiscal the company anticipates significant service enhancements and cost savings as it integrates with the oasis payment processing system being acquired from oasis technologies for approximately million of which  progress payments were made through september  this project is expected to be completed by the last quarter of this system will process card payments more efficiently and with more features and flexibility  thus free up the company s technical staff to speed up the development of new services and further integrate the multiple merchant related services 
with its direct settlement framework  oasis will offer pricing advantages by eliminating a key component of the company s cost structure by eliminating a third party processor  a savings of approximately ten basis points for every credit card dollar processed 
the implementation of this system will give the company a greater flexibility to price its credit card processing services  allowing the company to attract and retain larger merchants as well as the small and mid market merchants that have been its target market 
check related products

check services revenue made up of the total processing and transaction revenues for fiscal as compared to in the prior year

the visa program is continuing as planned 
the company is currently working with six visa member banks that have chosen to participate in this visa pilot program 
during the pilot phase  small numbers of merchants have been testing the visa program in conjunction with the banks 
the company will not be generating significant revenue from this visa program until the member banks have completed the pilot phase and begin to offer this program to their merchant base 
development and testing of the visa pos check services platform was largely completed by the end of fiscal  and some member banks have now begun to actively market the service to their merchant base 
management believes that the visa pos check services program will provide the company with significant opportunities to develop strategic relationships with some major banks  which could result in an increase in our check services revenue in the coming years 
other

the company entered into an amended contract with u haul in september and thereby extended the contract for another three year term 
the company currently serves approximately  u haul dealers nationwide 
check related products 
check related revenues increased from  for fiscal year to  in fiscal  a increase 
this was attributable to the additional check services being offered to the merchants in the current fiscal year and the continued higher growth experienced in the check related business segment 
check services revenue made up of total processing and transaction revenues in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
check related operating loss was  in fiscal  as compared to a loss of  in fiscal management believes that the growth in check related activities will continue to outpace the growth in the bankcard processing activities 
during fiscal  the company fully integrated its check services  such as check verification  check conversion  check guarantee  check re presentment  along with debit and credit card transactions through a verifone terminal platform 
this is one of the first terminal applications available in the market today that includes check conversion and captures check images with a scanner 
other 
other revenue increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal  an increase of due to more billable software development work 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had available cash of  restricted cash of  in reserve with its primary processing banks and working capital of  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased to  at september  from  at the end of fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects chargeback losses and dues to visa and mastercard increased to  at the end of the fiscal from  at september  this increase was attributable to the higher processing volume in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal the reduction in cash from operations was primarily attributable to the net loss  including the  cash portion of legal settlement expenses incurred during the quarter ended march  during fiscal  the company used  for the purchase of equipment and capitalized software costs 
as of november  the company negotiated a  lease line with a leasing company for the purpose of future computer equipment purchases 
the company is also finalizing a  loan with its primary sponsoring bank to fund the remaining scheduled payments of the oasis software in fiscal year total net cash used in investing activities was  for the current fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year in april  the company received  in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of certain computer software and hardware purchased 
the company used  for the repayment of capitalized leases in fiscal year as compared to  in fiscal year this increase was due to the additional new capitalized leases completed in the current fiscal year 
total net cash provided by financing activities was  for the current fiscal year as compared to net cash used by financing activities of  for fiscal year at september   the company had the following cash commitments payment due by period contractual less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt including interest      capital lease obligations    operating leases    total contractual cash obligations      the company s primary source of liquidity is expected to be cash flow generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents currently on hand 
management believes that its cash flow from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet its working capital and other commitments 
risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks  which could affect operating results and liquidity  including  among others  the following dependency on bank relationships 
the company currently relies on cooperative relationships with  and sponsorship by  banks in order to process its visa  mastercard and other bankcard transactions 
the company s banking relationships are currently with smaller banks with assets of less than 
even though smaller banks tend to be more susceptible to mergers or acquisitions and are therefore less stable  these banks find the programs more attractive and the company believes that it cannot obtain similar relationships with larger banks at this time 
a bank could at any time curtail or place restrictions on the processing volume 
a bank might do this because of its internal business policies or due to other adverse circumstances 
if a volume restriction is placed on the company  it could materially adversely affect the business operations by restricting the company s ability to process credit card transactions and receive the related revenue 
the company s relationships with its customers and merchants would also be adversely affected by its inability to process these transactions 
to limit this problem  the company currently maintains relationships with two banks 
however  the company cannot assure that these banks will not restrict its processing volume or that the company will always be able to maintain its present banking relationships or establish new banking relationships 
even if new banking relationships are available  they may not be on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s failure to maintain these banking relationships and sponsorships would have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations 
business relationship with u haul international 
the business relationship with u haul is important to the company but due to the growing merchant and check business and the full deployment to all u haul dealers  u haul has gradually become a less significant customer over the years 
u haul accounted for approximately of echo s revenue in and of the revenue in the company believes it has a good relationship with u haul and that its services are highly valued by u haul and its dealers  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the business relationship with u haul  or that sales to u haul will continue at the same levels as previous years 
losing u haul as a customer still could have a significant impact to the company 
bankcard fraud 
the company significantly relies on the processing of bankcard transactions 
if any merchants were to submit or process unauthorized or fraudulent bankcard transactions  depending on the dollar amount  echo could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations 
these types of losses are handled by the sponsoring banks as follows first regional bank echo assumes and compensates the bank for bearing the risk of these types of losses 
the berkshire bank echo assumes and compensates the bank for bearing the risk of these types of losses 
the company has implemented systems and software for the electronic surveillance and monitoring of fraudulent bankcard use 
the company also maintains a dedicated reserve of  at its primary bank specifically earmarked for such activity 
despite a long history of managing such risk  the company cannot guarantee that these systems will prevent fraudulent transactions from being submitted and processed or that the funds set aside to address such activity will be adequate to cover all potential situations that might occur 
the company does not have insurance to protect it from these losses  but the company does allocate ten basis points 
of daily processing activity as a reserve against these types of losses 
there is no assurance that this reserve will be adequate to offset against any unauthorized or fraudulent processing losses that the company may incur 
depending on the size of such losses the company s results of operations could be immediately and materially adversely affected 
dependence on key employees 
the company s success has been and will continue to be dependent on the services of key technical and managerial personnel such as joel m 
barry  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
barry could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business 
the company believes that its success also depends on its ability to continue to be able to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical and management employees and consultants who are in great demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such employees and its failure to do so could adversely affect its business 
risk of not remaining listed on nasdaq 
the company is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
there is no assurance that the listing of the company s common stock will  in the future  always continue to satisfy the nasdaq listing requirements 
if the company was delisted from nasdaq  this would have a material adverse effect on the price and the liquidity of the company s common stock 
competition 
the company is in the business of processing transactions and designing and implementing integrated systems for its customers so that they can better use echo s services 
this business is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and rapid rates of new products introduction 
the company s market share is relatively small as compared to most of its competitors and most of these competitors have substantially more financial and marketing resources to run their businesses 
this enables the company s competitors to quickly respond to new and emerging technologies  changes in customers needs  and to devote more resources to product and services development and marketing 
the company may face increased competition in the future and there is no assurance that current or new competition will allow the company to keep its customers 
if the company loses customers  its business operations may be materially adversely affected  which could cause it to cease its business or curtail its business to a point where the company is no longer able to generate sufficient revenues to fund operations 
there is no assurance that the company s current products and services will stay competitive with those of the company s competitors or that the company will be able to introduce new products and services to compete successfully in the future 
rapid technology changes 
the company s business industry involves rapidly changing technology 
recently  the company has observed rapid changes in technology as evident by the internet and internet related services and applications  new and better software  and faster computers and modems 
as technology changes  echo s customers desire and expect better products and services 
the company s success depends on its ability to improve its existing products and services and to develop and market new products and services 
the costs and expenses associated with such an effort could be significant to the company 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to find the funds necessary to keep up with new technology or that if such funds are available that the company can successfully improve its existing products and services or successfully develop new products and services 
the company s failure to provide improved products and services to its customers or any delay in providing such products and services could cause it to lose customers to its competitors 
loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on echo 
dependence on technology and related patents 
the company currently owns three patents that relate to unique aspects of its products or services 
even though the company has these patents  there can be no assurance the company s competitors will not be able to develop a better product or a better way of providing the company s services to its current or potential new customers 
the company s patents have not been tested in the courts so the company is unable to determine if they will be sustained in the company s favor 
if echo s patents are not sustained in its favor  the company s competitors could determine its business methods and then develop and market competing products and services 
such an outcome could cause the company to lose customers  which could materially adversely affect its results of operations 
the company has expended considerable time and money in the development of ideas and seeking patent protection for them 
if the company seeks additional patents in the future  or if the company is required to prosecute or defend its patents  the expenses associated with such patent related activities could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
certain of the company s intellectual property is not protected 
the company has expended a considerable amount of time and money to develop information systems for its merchants 
the company has not obtained any intellectual property protection or other protection on these information systems 
the company also believes that these information systems do not infringe upon the rights of any third parties  however  there is no assurance that third parties will not bring infringement claims against the company 
the company also has the right to use certain technology of others through various license agreements 
if a third party claimed these licenses were infringing their technology  the company could face additional infringement claims and potential negative results 
if an infringement claim is brought against the company and the company loses  it could be required to stop using that type of product  system or service as well as pay monetary damages to the person or entity making the claim 
this result could materially adversely affect results of operations and manner in which the company could do business 
if the company was not able to implement another method its business could fail 
if the company is required to continuously defend infringement claims  the costs and expenses associated with such a defense could be very expensive to the company and could materially adversely affect the results of operations 
investment in research and development 
the company continues to enter into projects  which it believes will assist the company in its efforts to stay competitive 
although the company believes that its investment in these projects will ultimately increase earnings  there is no assurance as to when or if these new products will show profitability 
need for additional funds 
the company uses funds generated from operations to finance its operations 
the company currently believes that the cash flow from operations is sufficient to support its business activities  including research  development and marketing costs 
future growth will depend on the company s ability to raise additional funds  either through operations  bank borrowings  or equity or debt financings 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to raise the funds necessary to finance growth or continue to generate the funds necessary to finance operations  and even if such funds are available  that the terms will be acceptable 
the inability to generate the necessary funds from operations or from third parties could force the company to cut back its operations by limiting research  development and growth opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on echo 
underwriter market maker 
trading markets for echo s common stock is maintained on nasdaq by various broker dealers who are members of the national association of securities dealers 
none of the market makers are under any legal obligation to maintain a market in the company s common stock and may discontinue such activities at any time 
if these market makers choose not to maintain a market in the company s common stock  such a discontinuance could have a material adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
lack of insurance protection for the company s products and services 
the company does not have insurance protection against claims for product liability or errors and omissions for the products and services sold by the company 
if claims are brought by the company s customers or other third parties  the company could be required to pay the required claim or make significant expenditures to defend against such claims 
there is no assurance that the company will have the money to pay such claims if they arise 
if the company does have the money to pay the claims  such a payment could have a material adverse effect upon on the company 
cost of defending lawsuits 
the company is involved in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the company believes that the claims asserted in such lawsuits are without merit  the cost to the company for the fees and expenses to defend such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will not at some time in the future experience significant liability in connection with such claims 
u haul relationship 
the company provides processing services to u haul international by acting as the central processor of u haul dealer rental activity and reservations 
during  u haul s ability to reach financing arrangements with its lenders was delayed and presents a potential risk to echo should u haul be unable to secure adequate financing agreements in the future 
the primary risk to the company in the event of a u haul bankruptcy announcement is believed to be timely payment of its outstanding invoices at the time of declaration 
the company believes any on going payment under a bankruptcy action would be reasonable to expect due to the critical nature of the company s service to u haul and its dealers 
the company is working closely with u haul to keep its current invoices paid and does not expect any significant issue to arise but no assurance can be given that a u haul declaration of bankruptcy would not have a material effect on the company 
handling significantly increased volume 
the company has built transaction processing systems for check verification  check conversion  ach processing  and bankcard processing activity 
while current estimates regarding increased volume are within the throughput capabilities of each system  it is possible that a significant increase in volume in one of the markets would exceed a specific system s capabilities 
to minimize this risk  echo is in the process of redesigning and upgrading its check related processing systems and echo has purchased a state of the art system to process bank card activity that should be operational by the end of no assurance can be given that the current systems would be able to handle a significant increase in volume or that the operational enhancements and improvements will be completed in such time to avoid such a situation 
recovering from natural disaster 
the company maintains three data center operations  one in agoura hills  california  one in albuquerque  new mexico and one in boulder  colorado 
should a natural disaster occur in one of the locations  it is possible that echo would not be able to fully recover full functionality at one of its data center locations 
to minimize this risk  echo is moving its data processing functionality from boulder to albuquerque in and will be making its agoura hills and albuquerque operations fully redundant to each other by the end of prior to that time  it is possible a natural disaster could limit or completely terminate a specific service offered by echo until such time that the specific location could resume its functionality 
financial risk from check guarantee 
the check guarantee business is essentially a risk management business 
any limitation of a risk management system could result in financial obligations being incurred by echo relative to its check guarantee activity 
while echo has provided check guarantee services for several years  there can be no assurance that its current risk management systems are adequate to assure against any financial loss relating to check guarantee 
echo is enhancing its current risk management systems and it is being conservative with reference to the type of merchants it offers guarantee services to in order to minimize this risk but no assurance can be given that such measures will be adequate 
security breach 
the company processes confidential financial information and maintains several levels of security to protect this data 
security includes hand and card based identification systems at its data center locations that restrict access to the specific facilities  various employee monitoring and access restriction policies  and various firewall and network management methodologies that restrict unauthorized access through the internet 
while these systems have worked effectively in the past  there can be no assurance that they will continue to operate without a security breach in the future 
depending upon the nature of the breach  the consequences of certain breaches could be significant and dramatic to echo s continued operations 
echo has undertaken a sas audit to continue to identify security issues and enhance their detection and defenses therefrom  however  no assurance can be given that echo s efforts in this regard will always prove to be adequate or successful 
cost of technical compliance 
the services which echo offers require significant technical compliance 
this includes compliance to both visa and mastercard regulations and association rules  nacha guidelines and regulations with regard to the ach and check related issues  and various banking requirements and regulations 
echo has personnel dedicated to monitoring the company s compliance to the specific industries we serve and  when possible  echo is moving the technical compliance responsibility to other parties  as is the case with the recent purchase of the oasis technologies bankcard processing system wherein oasis assumes much of the compliance obligation relative to visa and mastercard issues 
as the compliance issues become more defined in each industry  the cost associated thereto may present a risk to echo 
these costs could be in the form of additional hardware  software or technical expertise that echo must acquire and or maintain 
while echo currently has these costs under control  it has no control over those entities that set the compliance requirements so no assurance can be given that echo will always be able to underwrite the costs of compliance in each industry wherein it competes
