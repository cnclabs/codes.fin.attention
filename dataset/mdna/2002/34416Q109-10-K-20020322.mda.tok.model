item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
general during the year ended december   we continued to restructure the asset and liability structure of our balance sheet  significantly reduced our exposure to short term  mark to market based financing  disposed of our directly owned uk commercial property portfolio and began arranging and investing in new transactions 
our results of operations for the year ended december  reflect further impairment write downs of mortgage backed securities of million 
as a result of the continued impact of the marketplace on the company  stockholders equity decreased to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of million or 
during this same period  the size of our balance sheet was reduced from million to million 
the company s business strategy focuses on opportunistic investing  structuring and managing real estate related assets such as mortgage backed securities  mezzanine real estate loans and real estate  as well as the acquisition of companies engaged in investing in such assets 
we concentrate on the acquisition of assets where our expertise in intensive asset management  mortgage and real estate credit analysis and financial structuring can create value 
further  we expect that many of these investments  particularly in corporate acquisitions  will be in conjunction with partners 
critical accounting policies valuation at december   our largest asset was our portfolio of mortgage backed securities  which includes a retained interest in a resecuritization of several mortgage backed securities 
listed market prices or dealer lender value opinions are not available for most of the securities in our portfolio 
accordingly  in the absence of these third party quotations  fair values for these securities are determined by us  using a third party valuation model and internally developed assumptions 
valuation models and assumptions impact the carrying value of our mortgage backed securities and the amount and timing of gains and losses recognized 
the use of different valuation models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the fixed income markets and the actual performance of our mortgage backed securities may impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting  positively or negatively  our future operating results and equity 
our key valuation assumptions include default rates and loss severity  which account for the anticipated credit losses in the pools of loans underlying our mortgage backed securities 
other key valuation assumptions include prepayment rates and discount rates 
our internal valuation methodology calls for developing the key valuation assumptions of credit losses and prepayment speeds based upon the observable recent history of performance  generally averaged across the latest to months  subject to our general economic and market considerations 
our key valuation assumption of discount rates is developed based on the assessment of the current yields required by investors for similar classes of fixed income instruments 
we apply our valuation methodology consistently and believe that the resulting fair value estimates are reasonable  however  these estimated values may differ from those realized in a bona fide sale transaction  given the judgmental nature of the values of these assets 
during the years ended december    and  we incurred significant losses of million  million  and million  respectively  due to decreases in value of our mortgage backed securities 
these losses resulted from the worsening credit and prepayment performance of our mortgage backed securities as well as increases in the market yields for investments of such high risk assets 
we believe our assumptions and the resulting estimated values of the mortgage backed securities at december  are conservative based on the facts and circumstances as of that date  however  there can be no assurance that there will be no future losses on these securities due to changes in their performance or overall market conditions 
sale recognition during  we carried out several significant sales of our real estate investments  mortgage backed securities  and loans 
our accounting policy calls for the recognition of sales of the financial instruments  including mortgage backed securities and loans  only when we have surrendered irrevocable control over these assets 
our accounting policy calls for the recognition of sales of real estate upon closing when we transferred the usual risks of ownership and all or substantially all of the rewards of ownership to the buyer 
we do not retain any recourse or performance obligations with respect to our sales of assets 
our sales were cash sales  and the cash proceeds were not contingent upon any future event 
results of operations compared to net loss 
our net loss for the year ended december  amounted to million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for the year ended december  the net loss is primarily attributable to million of market valuation losses and impairments and significant operating expenses 
the net loss for was primarily the result of million of market valuation losses and impairments 
net interest income 
the following tables set forth information regarding the total amount of income from interest earning assets and expenses from interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and rates for the year ended december  average interest balance income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loan portfolios   mortgage backed securities available for sale   other investments  total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities short term and other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income before provision for loan losses spread  net interest margin net interest spread represents the unweighted difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
for the year ended december  average interest balance income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loan portfolios   mortgage backed securities available for sale   other investments  total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities short term and other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income before provision for loan losses spread  net interest margin net interest spread represents the unweighted difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   the company recovered million of the allowance for loan losses 
this amount is not reflected in the net interest income spread above 
prepayments  delinquencies and defaults affect the net spread of the company  primarily through their impact on mortgage loans that underlie the securities in the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
for principal and interest subordinated mortgage backed securities  which the company generally purchases at a discount to principal amount  increased prepayments recapture such purchase discount sooner and therefore increase spread 
fewer prepayments would have the opposite effect  reducing spread 
for residuals  prepayment increases generally reduce spread since these securities derive their value from interest payments on loans that are outstanding 
residuals have both a principal face amount and often a credit related io component 
increased prepayment often reduces spread except to the extent that such prepayment is related to a recovery on a defaulted loan 
the impact on spread  however  depends upon the degree to which prepayment is less than or exceeds the company s assumptions for prepayment at its time of purchase 
the company buys mortgage backed securities based on prepayment  delinquency and default assumptions 
delinquency itself has little effect on spread from the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio since the loan servicers for each security generally advance both principal and interest payments and  therefore  the company generally receives payments on such loans on a timely basis 
more important is the loss severity on defaulted loans 
generally  the larger the loss severity is  the greater the reduction in spread will be 
however  the company s spread is only negatively impacted to the extent the principal face amount of defaults and the cumulative loss severity exceeds or is expected to exceed the company s assumptions at its time of purchase or as subsequently adjusted through an other than temporary impairment determination 
recovery of loan losses 
during the year ended december   we reviewed the adequacy of loan loss reserves and recaptured the remaining reserve balance of million 
at december   we had million of loans that are performing according to their terms with no required loan loss allowance 
real estate operations 
during the years ended december  and  real estate operating income was comprised primarily of million and million  respectively  in gross rental and other income earned on such investments 
expenses incurred on such real estate investments for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of interest expense  million and million  respectively  of rental operating expense and million and million  respectively  of depreciation expense 
other loss 
our other loss was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the components of the company s net non interest loss are comprised of the following market valuation losses and impairments 
the term market valuation losses and impairments as used herein refers to impairment losses recognized primarily on our mortgage backed securities and loan portfolios 
total market valuation losses and impairments for the year ended december  were million 
this amount includes million of market valuation losses and impairments related to our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale  million related to our investment in loans  million related to our investment in prepaid service fees in an affiliate of wfsg  and million related to our investment in real estate 
as a result of the write down in the value of certain of our mortgage backed securities and the sale of other mortgage backed securities in and  we believe that the value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has stabilized and that barring unforeseen circumstances  we should not continue to experience the same level of losses experienced by the company in the last two years 
total market valuation losses and impairments for the year ended december  were million 
this amount includes million of market valuation losses and impairments related to our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale and million related to our prepaid service fees from an affiliate of wfsg 
approximately million of these amounts were impaired in the fourth quarter of due primarily to the receipt of additional detailed information from the servicer of the underlying mortgages to certain mortgage backed securities 
provision for litigation claims 
the company and two of its senior officers have been named  among other defendants  in a series of lawsuits related to the receivership of an unaffiliated investment company 
in their claims  multiple plaintiffs allege several theories of liability  including knowing participation in fiduciary breach and prohibited transactions under the employee retirement income security act of because the cases are still in early stages of the pleadings and because the amount of discovery has been limited  the ultimate financial loss to the company cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
however  based upon the progress of the mediation through december   the company has made a provision for litigation of million 
the company can give no assurances that the ultimate settlement or result of litigation will be limited to the amount of the provision 
equity in losses of bep 
in february  the company through a owned jersey  channel islands company known as bep acquisitions purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of bourne end properties plc bourne end 
bourne end is a specialist investor in retail property  currently owning fifteen town shopping centers located in england and scotland 
bep is highly leveraged and operating income from the properties is offset by interest expense and depreciation 
the company accounts for this investment using the equity method  thereby recording its share of income and expense generated by bep 
during  the company recorded million in operating losses relating to this investment 
bep is expected to become profitable as it sells properties and retires indebtedness  a process which began during the fourth quarter of gain on the sale of securities 
during the years ended december  and  we sold mortgage backed securities to unrelated third parties for approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
operating expenses 
during  operating expenses were comprised of compensation and employee benefits of million  professional fees of million and other costs of million 
in an effort to improve profitability and liquidity  we have sought to reduce our expenses 
in that connection  in august   we moved our executive offices to smaller offices  which better reflected our needs 
in addition  effective during the fourth quarter of  we entered into new employment agreements with our chief executive officer  president and an executive vice president  and re structured the compensation for our directors 
in the fourth quarter of  the company established a trust  which purchased  shares of the company s common stock from an unrelated shareholder 
the company s contribution of approximately million is included in compensation expenses 
the trust was established for the benefit of the company s employees and directors to raise their ownership in the company  thereby strengthening the mutuality of interests between them and the company s shareholders 
while these shares are held in trust  they will be voted ratably with ballots cast by all other shareholders 
results of operations compared to net loss 
our net loss for the year ended december  amounted to million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for the year ended december  the net loss is primarily attributable to million of market valuation losses and impairments compared to million of market valuation losses and impairment for net interest income

for principal and interest subordinated mortgage backed securities  which the company generally purchases at a discount to principal amount  increased prepayments recapture such purchase discount sooner and therefore increase spread 
fewer prepayments would have the opposite effect  reducing spread 
for ios and residuals  prepayment increases generally reduce spread since these securities derive their value from interest payments on loans that are outstanding 
ios have no principal face amount other than a notional balance and therefore are quite responsive to changes in prepayment 
residuals have both a principal face amount and often a credit related io component 
increased prepayment often reduces spread except to the extent that such prepayment is related to a recovery on a defaulted loan 
the impact on spread  however  depends upon the degree to which prepayment is less than or exceeds the company s assumptions for prepayment at its time of purchase

recovery of loan losses 
during the year ended december   we reviewed the adequacy of loan loss reserves and recaptured the remaining reserve balance of million 
at december   we had million of loans that are performing according to their terms with no required loan loss allowance 
during the year ended december   we reversed a provision for losses of million taken in prior periods for a loan held for sale 
the loan was secured by commercial properties in the united kingdom uk with a carrying value of approximately million 
this valuation allowance had been established in based upon management s estimate at that time of the ultimate recoverability of the asset 
this provision reversal was partially offset by a provision for losses on loans of million 
in addition  we recognized a net write down of million in the carrying value of a million note receivable from wfsg to reflect the estimated value of the common stock of wfsg 
real estate operations 
during the years ended december  and  real estate operating income was comprised primarily of million and million  respectively  in gross rental and other income earned on such investments 
expenses incurred on such real estate investments for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of interest expense  million and million  respectively  of rental operating expense and million and million  respectively  of depreciation expense 
other loss 
our other loss was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the components of the company s net non interest loss are comprised of the following market valuation losses and impairments 
the term market valuation losses and impairments as used herein refers to impairment losses recognized primarily on our mortgage backed securities and loan portfolios 
total market valuation losses and impairments for the year ended december  were million 
this amount includes million of market valuation losses and impairments related to our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale and million related to our prepaid service fees from an affiliate of wfsg 
approximately million of these amounts were impaired in the fourth quarter of due primarily to the receipt of additional detailed information from the servicer of the underlying mortgages to certain mortgage backed securities 
total market valuation losses and impairments for the year ended december  were million 
this amount includes million of market valuation losses and impairments related to our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale  million related to our investment in newly issued wfsg stock  million related to fees for advisory services in connection with our investment in wfsg stock and million related to our holdings of wfsg s series b notes prior to their conversion to newly issued wfsg stock 
provision for disputes with wfsg 
the company decided to become internally managed in the third quarter of which resulted in disputes between the company  on the one hand  and wfsg and certain of its affiliates  on the other 
in connection with these disputes  the company recorded a reserve for potential resolution of disputes with wfsg and its affiliates of million at september  following a partial settlement of disputes with wfsg  the remaining reserve for potential resolution of disputes with wfsg and its affiliates was million at december  during the year ended december   the company settled all remaining disputes with wfsg and its affiliates which resulted in an additional provision of million 
gain on the sale of securities 
during the years ended december  and  we sold mortgage backed securities to unrelated third parties for approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
operating expenses 
as discussed above  we decided to become internally managed in the third quarter of as a result  management fees payable to our prior manager have ceased and have been replaced with compensation to the company s employees 
the company now incurs its own overhead and operating costs that were previously incurred primarily by the manager 
professional fees during the year ended december  were higher than primarily due to the litigation with wfsg and its affiliates 
in the fourth quarter of  the company established a trust which purchased  shares of the company s common stock from an unrelated shareholder 
the company s contribution of approximately million is included in compensation expenses 
the trust was established for the benefit of the company s employees and directors to raise their ownership in the company  thereby strengthening the mutuality of interests between them and the company s shareholders 
while these shares are held in trust  they will be voted ratably with ballots cast by all other shareholders 
changes in financial condition during  total assets decreased to million from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of a net reduction of million of securities available for sale  million of loans and million of investments in real estate 
total liabilities decreased to million during the period  primarily as a result of a net decrease of million in borrowings associated with sales of mortgage backed securities  loans and investments in real estate 
securities available for sale 
at december   securities available for sale included mortgage backed securities with an aggregate market value of million  net of realized and unrealized gains or losses  compared to million at december  this decrease of million is primarily due to the sale of million of securities  net principal payments received of million  conversion of million of mortgage backed securities into the loans and real estate which had served as collateral supporting these securities and a decrease in market value of million 
in december  we refinanced the debt on approximately million of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
this transaction was treated as a secured financing transaction rather than a sale for accounting purposes due to certain call provisions retained by the company 
as such  our balance sheet continues to reflect these securities as well as the senior bonds of million which replaced the short term  mark to market debt previously collateralized by these securities 
we mark our securities portfolio to fair value at the end of each month 
we determine the fair value of the securities by modeling the anticipated cash flows using certain estimates eg prepayment speeds  default rates  severity of losses  and discount rate 
as of each reporting period  we evaluate whether and to what extent any unrealized loss is to be recognized as other than temporary 
loan portfolio 
during the year ended december   our loan portfolio was reduced primarily as a result of principal repayments to approximately million from million at december  we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that the company considers adequate to provide for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks 
based upon our assessment  no allowance for loan losses was required at december  and investments in real estate 
investments in real estate decreased approximately million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to sale of eighteen retail and office properties  all located in the united kingdom  with a carrying value of approximately million 
in addition  we recognized approximately million of depreciation expense related to operating properties 
we are currently in the process of marketing certain other commercial properties for sale as we continue to reduce our level of investment in commercial real estate income properties to increase liquidity for working capital and reinvestment opportunities 
borrowings 
borrowings decreased to approximately million during the year ended december   funded primarily from the sale of real estate  subordinated mortgage backed securities and the receipt of principal payments on our loan portfolio 
interest rates on borrowings under these facilities are generally based on day london interbank offer rate libor rates  plus a spread 
repurchase agreements are secured lending arrangements which involve the borrower selling an asset to a lender at a fixed price with the borrower having an obligation to repurchase the asset within a specified period generally days at a higher price reflecting the interest cost of the loan 
if the value of the underlying asset declines or the lender marks the asset lower  the lender may request that the amount of the loan be reduced by cash payments from the borrower or additional collateral be provided by the borrower generally known as collateral calls 
accordingly  in an environment where lenders consistently mark down the value of the underlying assets  a borrower can become subject to significant collateral calls 
if the borrower does not have sufficient cash to meet the collateral call or additional unencumbered assets to pledge  it may be forced to sell assets to repay the loan 
if the company experiences further downward marks to market of its assets subject to repurchase agreements  it could experience cash collateral calls  thereby reducing liquidity  or be forced to sell further assets  which could result in losses 
we have significantly reduced our exposure to short term financing for mortgage backed securities and the possibility of collateral calls with respect to these financings 
at december   we had million of borrowings 
of this amount  million financed real estate investments of million  million consisted of repurchase agreements on mortgage backed securities  and million related to senior bonds issued as part of the resecuritization discussed above 
our borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of at december during  we sold a pool of mortgage backed securities to a special purpose vehicle which acquired the loans from us with the proceeds from the issuance of long term indebtedness 
we retained an equity interest in the special purpose vehicle and there is no recourse to the company in respect of the indebtedness incurred by the special purpose vehicle 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased to million during the year ended december  the net decrease in stockholders equity during this period was primarily attributable to our net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  engage in loan acquisition and lending activities  meet collateral calls and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity during the year ended december  consisted of net cash provided by investing activities  including cash repayments related to our mortgage backed securities portfolio  and the sale of mortgage backed securities and real estate 
our borrowings and the availability of further borrowings are substantially affected by  among other things  changes in interest rates  changes in market spreads whereby the market value of the collateral securing such borrowings may decline substantially  or decreases in credit quality of underlying assets 
in the event of declines in market value or credit quality  we may be required to provide additional collateral for  or repay a portion of outstanding balances of  our short term borrowing facilities 
as of december   we had no outstanding collateral calls 
for additional information with respect to our monthly mark to market of our securities available for sale portfolio  see changes in financial condition securities available for sale 
fluctuations in interest rates will continue to impact our net interest income to the extent our fixed rate assets are funded by variable rate debt or our variable rate assets reprice on a different schedule or in relation to a different index than any floating rate debt which in turn could impact potential returns to shareholders 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
at december   we had total consolidated secured indebtedness of million  as well as million of other liabilities 
the consolidated secured indebtedness consisted of i million of repurchase agreements secured by million of mortgage backed securities and ii million outstanding of other borrowings maturing between and which are secured by real estate and mortgage backed securities 
approximately million of this indebtedness had terms which allowed the lender to request additional collateral if the value of the underlying collateral declined including financing facilities for both mortgage backed securities and loans 
although the company believes that the likelihood of significant declines in asset values has decreased since the third quarter of  the company is seeking to maintain a larger cash position and more unencumbered assets to deal with any future potential collateral calls 
borrowings are established through both short term and long term financing facilities 
if the value of the assets securing the loan declines as determined by the lender  the lender may request that the amount of the loan be reduced by cash payments from the borrower or additional collateral be provided by the borrower generally known as collateral calls 
accordingly  in an environment where lenders consistently mark down the value of the underlying assets  a borrower can become subject to collateral calls  which can have a significant impact on liquidity 
similarly  if interest rates increase significantly  the borrowing cost under the financing facility may also increase while the interest rate on the assets securing the loan may not increase at the same time or to the same degree 
real property acquisitions are financed with intermediate or long term mortgages with banks and other financial institutions 
we have historically financed acquisitions of mortgage backed securities through committed and uncommitted thirty day repurchase agreements with major wall street investment banks 
repurchase agreements are secured lending arrangements  which involve the borrower selling an asset to a lender at a fixed price with the borrower having an obligation to repurchase the asset within a specified period generally days at a higher price reflecting the interest cost of the loan 
if the lender marks the asset lower  the lender may request that the amount of the loan be reduced by cash payments from the borrower or additional collateral be provided by the borrower 
mortgage backed securities which are subject to repurchase agreements  as well as loans which secure other indebtedness  periodically are revalued by the lender  and a decline in the value that is recognized by the lender whether or not the lender recognizes the full fair value of the security may result in the lender requiring us to provide additional collateral to secure the indebtedness 
other than an unfunded million secured line of credit  substantially all of our assets that are capable of being pledged have been pledged to secure our outstanding indebtedness 
as a result  if we are unable to fund additional collateral requirements or to repay  renew or replace maturing indebtedness on terms reasonably satisfactory to us  we may be required to sell potentially on short notice a portion of our assets  and could incur losses as a result 
furthermore  since from time to time there is extremely limited liquidity in the market for subordinated and residual interests in mortgage related securities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of such securities promptly for fair value in such situations 
although we are currently operating with negative cash flow primarily due to the continued repayment of debt and refinancing of our mortgage backed securities portfolio  we believe that our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term liquidity needs 
there can be no assurance that this will be the case  however 
material increases in interest expense from variable rate funding sources  collateral calls  or material decreases in monthly cash receipts  generally would negatively impact our liquidity 
on the other hand  material decreases in interest expense from variable rate funding sources generally would positively affect our liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has decreased significantly during the year ended december  approximately of the company s equity is invested in the united kingdom at december  
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the company s net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  the ability of the company to acquire loans  the value of the company s mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  the company s strategy is to limit our exposure to earnings variations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value as of december  should interest rates go up or down shocked by to basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and instantaneous 
net portfolio value is calculated as the sum of the value of off balance sheet instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets net of cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities 
the cash flows associated with the loan portfolios and securities available for sale are calculated based on prepayment and default rates that vary by asset but not by changes in interest rates 
projected losses  as well as prepayments  are generated based upon the actual experience with the subject pool  as well as similar  more seasoned pools 
to the extent available  loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history and product types are used to produce the projected loss and prepayment assumptions that are included in the cash flow projections of the securities 
the following tables apply the us treasury yield curve generally for assets and libor for repurchase agreement liabilities and assume a uniform change in both rates 
the tables assume that changes in interest rates occur instantaneously 
the tables also reflect that the company has a significant exposure to libor rates since its short term repurchase agreement borrowings are generally based on libor rates 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the tables 
projected percent change in change in interest change in monthly change in net portfolio rates net interest income net portfolio value interest rates value basis points   basis points   basis points basis points   basis points   assumes that uniform changes occur instantaneously in both the yield on year us treasury notes and the interest rate applicable to us dollar deposits in the london interbank market 
the following table sets forth information as to the type of funding used to finance the company s assets as of december  as indicated in the table  a large percentage of the company s fixed rate assets are financed by floating rate liabilities and the company s variable rate assets are generally funded by variable rate liabilities which use the same index 
assets and liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands interest bearing assets basis amount coupon type liability type fixed rate assets  financed floating  fixed  libor fixed rate assets  no financing  fixed none cash and cash equivalents  n a none subtotal   other assets investments in real estate  n a  fixed investments in wfsg and affiliates  n a none investment in bep  n a none other  n a none subtotal   liability only accounts payable and accrued liabilities  none total   asset and liability management involves managing the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
asset and liability management can utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist it in the management of interest rate risk 
for example  in hedging the interest rate and exchange rate exposure of a foreign currency denominated asset or liability  we may enter into hedge transactions to counter movements in the different currencies as well as interest rates in those currencies 
these hedges may be in the form of currency and interest rate swaps  options  and forwards  or combinations thereof 
no such techniques were in use as of december  methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
since different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated contractual maturity or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  as of december  dollars in thousands within to one year to more than total months months years years interest sensitive assets cash and cash equivalents   securities available for sale   loans   total rate sensitive assets    interest sensitive liabilities borrowings    total rate sensitive liabilities    interest rate sensitivity gap    cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets real estate property holdings are not considered interest rate sensitive
