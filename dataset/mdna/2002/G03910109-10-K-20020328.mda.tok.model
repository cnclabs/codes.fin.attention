item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions developed by our management 
any adjustments to reported bases of assets or liabilities resulting from changes in estimates are reflected in earnings in the period the estimates are revised 
certain management estimates are based  in part  on information provided by ceding companies 
our ceding companies periodically update  refine and revise the reinsurance information they provide to us 
this revised data is reflected in earnings as changes in estimates 
forward looking statements with the exception of historical information  the matters contained in the following analysis are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
such statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of earnings  revenues  income or loss  capital expenditures  plans for future operations and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing 
the words expect  project  estimate  predict  anticipate  believes  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results  performance and achievements could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by or underlying the forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect actual results or changes in or additions to the factors affecting such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause our actual results of operations or financial condition to differ from those described in this report include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following a decline in our financial ratings would adversely affect our business 
insurers and reinsurance intermediaries use insurance ratings as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
am best has assigned an a rating to annuity and life re holdings  annuity and life reassurance and annuity and life reassurance america 
am best has announced that our rating is under review with negative implications 
our subsidiaries  annuity and life reassurance and annuity and life reassurance america have received an a rating from standard poor s  which has placed both companies on creditwatch with negative implications 
annuity and life reassurance has been rated a by fitch ratings  which also has a negative ratings outlook 
a downgrade in any of our ratings would adversely affect our ability to sell products and retain existing business 
in particular  it is a condition in some of our reinsurance treaties that we maintain certain minimum credit ratings of a 
we face significant competition from major us and us reinsurers  many of which are well established and have substantially greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
competition in the reinsurance business is based on many factors  including premium charges  reputation  financial strength  terms and conditions of products offered  financial ratings  claims adjudication philosophy and general industry experience 
if we are unable to maintain or increase our position in the market our business could be adversely affected 
furthermore  because we rely on a small number of clients  our business is more susceptible to the adverse effects of competition from other reinsurers 
management of our underwriting risk is critical to the success of our business 
in particular  we structure our investments to match our anticipated liabilities under reinsurance policies 
if our calculations with respect to our reinsurance liabilities are incorrect  or if we improperly structure our investments to match such liabilities  we could have unexpected losses  including losses resulting from forced liquidation of investments prior to their maturity 
our success is dependent on our ability to manage our investment risks 
the success of our investment strategy may be affected by general economic conditions  which can adversely affect the markets for interest rate sensitive securities and equity securities  including the level and volatility of interest rates and the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets 
unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which we directly or indirectly hold positions could adversely affect our business 
our investment guidelines permit us to make some investments in below investment grade fixed income securities 
while any investment carries some risk  the risks associated with lower rated securities generally are greater than the risks associated with investment grade securities 
we may also seek to hedge the equity related investment risk associated with our products 
if we fail to match the equity related asset risk accurately with the equity related liabilities we could be exposed to the volatility of the equity markets 
this could result in losses  which  in turn could adversely affect our business 
all of our funds withheld assets related to our annuity reinsurance agreements are held and managed by our cedents or by investment managers appointed by our cedents 
the performance of these assets  therefore  depends to a great extent on the ability of our cedents  or our cedents investment managers  to make appropriate investments 
if these assets do not accumulate at rates sufficient to meet minimum guarantees on the underlying policies before the policyholder surrenders the policy  we could be forced to fund these minimum guarantees 
this could result in significant losses which  in turn could adversely affect our business 
some of the products offered by our cedents allow policyholders to withdraw their funds under certain circumstances 
we seek to manage our investment portfolios so as to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands 
unanticipated withdrawal or surrender activity may  under some circumstances  require us to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms  which could have an adverse affect on our business 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
as a result of terrorism  the united states has entered into an armed conflict which could have a further impact on our business 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of further terrorist attacks and these armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse affect on our business 
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
the loss of the services of key individuals  our inability to hire and retain other talented personnel  or our inability to secure appropriate work permits could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
these laws and regulations cover many aspects of our business  including licensure  premium rates  marketing practices and capital adequacy 
recently  the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions and regulators have started to reexamine existing laws and regulations 
changes in these laws and regulations could have an adverse affect on our operations 
the market for annuities and many life insurance products in the united states is based in part on the favorable tax treatment such products receive relative to certain other investment alternatives 
any material change in such tax treatment would have an adverse affect on the market for such products 
in addition  many life insurance products are used to reduce federal estate tax obligations 
the united states congress has recently adopted legislation that eliminates federal estate tax over a ten year period 
under this legislation  the demand for life insurance products could be reduced  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
a prolonged general economic downturn or a prolonged downturn in the equity and other capital markets could adversely affect the market for many annuity and life insurance products 
if the market for annuities or life insurance were adversely affected  it would likely depress the demand for reinsurance of annuities or life insurance  which would have an adverse affect on our business 
as a holding company  we have no significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries are our sole source of funds to pay expenses and dividends 
the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries is subject to and limited by regulatory restrictions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that we will declare and pay dividends in the future 
annuity and life re holdings and annuity and life reassurance are bermuda corporations and do not file united states tax returns because we do not engage in business in the united states 
however  because there is no definitive guidance as to what constitutes being engaged in trade or business in the united states  there can be no assurance that in the future the internal revenue service may not contend that we are engaged in trade or business in the united states 
if we were considered to be engaged in business in the united states  we could be subject to united states tax at regular corporate rates on our taxable income that is effectively connected with our united states business plus an additional branch profits tax on such income remaining after the regular tax 
such taxes would have an adverse affect on our business 
general our two major business lines are life reinsurance and annuity reinsurance 
reinsurance agreements typically remain in force for the life of the underlying policies reinsured which range from ten to thirty years 
each year  a portion of the business under an existing treaty terminates due to  among other things  surrenders and or lapses of underlying policies  deaths of underlying insureds and the exercise of recapture options 
profitability of the life reinsurance line depends in large part on the volume and amount of death claims incurred 
while death claims are reasonably predictable over a long time horizon  they are less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter and year to year 
significant fluctuations from period to period could adversely affect the results of operations 
at december  and  our life insurance in force amounted to approximately billion and billion  respectively 
we retrocede portions of certain risks in excess of our maximum per life retention of million 
at december  and  we had ceded approximately million and million of life insurance coverage  respectively  or and of our life insurance in force  respectively 
our primary annuity products are reinsurance of fixed deferred annuities and payout annuities structures 
profitability of the annuity reinsurance line is primarily dependent on earning a spread between the interest rate earned on the assets under management and the interest rate credited to the policyholder 
this product line is market and interest rate sensitive 
fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  fixed income markets  and equity markets from period to period may cause fluctuations in the results of operations 
this product line can be adversely impacted by the combined effects of poor market performance and excessive surrender rates  which occurred in at december  and  our liability for annuity contracts amounted to approximately billion 
critical accounting policies annuity and life re holdings  ltd 
is a bermuda holding company with operating subsidiaries in bermuda and the united states 
our principal business is reinsurance of life and annuity risks 
we consolidate the operations of all our subsidiaries in this report in accordance with us gaap requirements 
in preparing our financial statements we use estimates and assumptions based upon the best information available  and management s best judgment  at the time our financial statements are prepared 
the most significant estimates relate to policyholder benefit reserves for both life and annuity business and deferred acquisition costs 
these valuation accounts are estimates requiring us to make assumptions about future mortality  lapses  expenses  and investment results 
while these estimates are based upon historical results and information provided to us by our cedents  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
we report our fixed maturity investments at fair value our securities are classified as available for sale with any change in their fair value reported as a change in accumulated comprehensive income 
if we determine that the value of an investment has declined other than temporarily we write the investment down to its fair value with a charge to realized losses 
realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method 
reinsurance premium revenues from life products with mortality risk are recognized when due from the policyholders 
for those policies with premium paying periods that are significantly shorter than the total period over which benefits are expected to be provided  profits are deferred and recognized as income in a constant relationship to the insurance in force or  for annuities  in relation to the amount of expected future benefit payments 
premiums from universal life and investment type contracts are reported in the balance sheet as interest sensitive contracts liability 
revenues from these investment type contracts consist of income earned on the assets and amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges  policy administration charges and surrender charges 
deposit accounting procedures are applied to considerations received or paid relating to reinsurance contracts that do not qualify for reinsurance accounting 
policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policyholders account balances 
these estimates and assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts we report in our financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss 
for the year ended december   we had a consolidated net loss of  per primary and fully diluted common share  compared to net income of  per primary common share and per fully diluted common share  for the year ended december  as more fully discussed below  our results for were adversely affected by poor performance on a major annuity reinsurance contract  adverse mortality experience on two major life reinsurance contracts  and the september th tragedy 
net operating income 
in addition to net income  we report net operating income 
this is not a substitute for net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  but is an important measure used by management  equity analysts and investors to measure our performance 
we define net operating income as net income excluding realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
our definition of net operating income may differ from that used by other public life and annuity companies 
our net operating loss for the year ended december  was  compared with net operating income of  for the year ended december  the net operating loss was the result of a  charge related to minimum interest guarantees  a  charge for non recoverable deferred acquisition costs  a  loss from adverse mortality experience on two of our inforce life reinsurance contracts underwritten in  and a  charge for the september tragedy 
the first two charges both relate to our largest annuity reinsurance contract  and result from the combined impact of excessive surrenders and poor investment performance 
as discussed elsewhere in this report we are seeking relief from our ceding reinsurers with respect to the two life reinsurance contracts mentioned above 
if we are unable to rescind  recapture  reprice  or otherwise restructure these agreements  we may incur additional losses on these contracts in future periods 
net premiums 
net premium revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of over the year ended december  the majority of premium revenue was derived from traditional ordinary life reinsurance developed directly and through the use of intermediaries 
the growth reflects the level of new business written and the increase in the face amount of insurance in force 
at december  the total face amount of life insurance in force was approximately billion compared with approximately billion at december   an increase of 
new business writings and premium revenue levels are significantly influenced by large transactions and therefore can fluctuate from period to period 
net investment income 
total net investment income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of from the year ended december  the decline was primarily due to the reduction in net investment income from our largest annuity reinsurance contract 
as a result  income earned in on funds withheld declined to  from approximately  for the year ended december   reflecting a general decline in interest rates and poor investment performance on the assets managed by the cedent 
the average yield rate earned on an annualized basis on the invested assets  excluding funds withheld  was approximately for the year ended december  compared with for the year ending december   reflecting an overall decline in interest rates 
realized investment gains losses 
realized investment gains were approximately  for the year ended december  compared with realized losses of  for the year ended december  these gains and losses result from normal active management of our investment portfolio intended to improve performance and increase operating income 
we do not consider realized gains and losses to be recurring components of earnings 
we make decisions concerning the sale of invested assets based on a variety of market  business and other factors 
at december  we had unrealized gains of approximately  as compared with unrealized gains of  at december  the change in unrealized gains and losses is principally related to movements in the general level of interest rates 
claims and policy benefits 
claims and policy benefits includes both life and annuity benefits 
life insurance claims and policy benefits for the year ended december  were  or of net premium as compared with  or of net premium for the year ended december  aggregate mortality experience has been negatively impacted by  of adverse mortality experience on two of the company s inforce life reinsurance contracts underwritten in and a  charge for the world trade center tragedy 
as discussed elsewhere in this report we are seeking relief from our ceding reinsurers with respect to these two life reinsurance contracts 
if we are unable to rescind  recapture  reprice  or otherwise restructure these agreements  we may incur additional losses on these contracts in future periods 
the mortality experience of our book  excluding the two early life reinsurance contracts  is within pricing parameters 
although we expect mortality to be fairly constant over long periods of time  it will fluctuate from period to period 
reserves for future policy benefits are in part determined by claims reported from ceding companies  our aggregate experience and overall mortality trends 
interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities 
interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared with approximately  for the year ended december  the expense includes a  charge for minimum interest guarantees resulting from poor investment performance and excessive surrender rates on our largest annuity reinsurance contract 
after adjusting for this charge interest credited for the year is  a reduction of  from last year reflecting the general decline in interest rates credited to policyholders 
policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses 
policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  consisting primarily of allowances and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  were approximately  for the year ended december  this expense includes a  charge to write down deferred acquisition costs to a level that can be supported from our revised view of future surrender rates on our largest annuity reinsurance contract due to its poor persistency 
while management has made what it believes to be adequate provision for future costs based upon reasonable assumptions about future investment performance and surrenders  the provision is an estimate 
actual amounts paid may be significantly higher or lower than the current reserve 
after adjusting for the third quarter charge policy acquisition costs and other insurance costs were  as compared with  for the year ended december  generally  policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses fluctuate with business volume and changes in product mix 
the increase in these costs  as adjusted  reflects the growth and development of our life reinsurance business 
other operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  or of total revenue for the year ended december   as compared with  or of total revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in the ratio of operating expenses to total revenue is due to our premium growth 
we consider the operating expense level to be low by industry standards and in line with our plan to be a low cost provider 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income 
for the year ended december   we had consolidated net income of  which is per common share  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  compared with per common share  per common share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended december  net operating income 
in addition to net income  we report net operating income 
this is not a substitute for net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  but is an important measure used by management  equity analysts and investors to measure our results 
we define net operating income as net income excluding realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
our definition of net operating income may differ from that used by other public life and annuity companies 
for the year ended december  net operating income increased over the prior year 
net operating income for the year ending december  was  compared with  for the year ended december  the increase in net operating income was due to the growth and development of our reinsurance operations and favorable underwriting and investment results 
net premiums 
net premium revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of over the year ended december  the majority of premium revenue was derived from traditional ordinary life reinsurance developed directly and through the use of intermediaries 
the growth reflects the level of new business written and the increase in the face amount of insurance in force 
at december  the total face amount of life insurance in force was approximately billion compared with approximately billion at december   an increase of 
new business writings and premium revenue levels are significantly influenced by the seasonal nature of the life reinsurance marketplace and by large transactions and therefore can fluctuate from period to period 
net investment income 
total net investment income for the year ended december  was  an increase of over the year ended december  the growth in the investment income was primarily due to the income earned on funds withheld under modified coinsurance agreements related to our interest sensitive contracts liabilities 
the income earned on the funds withheld was approximately  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the average yield rate earned on an annualized basis on the invested assets  excluding funds withheld  was approximately for the year ended december  compared with for the year ending december  realized investment gains losses 
realized investment losses were approximately  for the year ended december  compared with realized losses of  for the year ended december  these gains and losses result from normal active management of our investment portfolio intended to improve performance and increase operating income 
we do not consider realized gains and losses to be recurring components of earnings 
we make decisions concerning the sales of invested assets based on a variety of market  business and other factors 
during the year ended december  we had unrealized gains of approximately  as compared with unrealized losses of  during the year ended december  which were included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the change in unrealized gains and losses is principally related to movements in the general level of interest rates 
claims and policy benefits 
life insurance claims and policy benefits for the year ended december  were  or of net premium as compared with  or of net premium for the year ended december  aggregate mortality experience has been favorable  falling within pricing parameters 
although we expect mortality to be fairly constant over long periods of time  it will fluctuate from period to period 
reserves for future policy benefits are in part determined by claims reported from ceding companies  our aggregate experience and overall mortality trends 
interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities 
interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared with approximately  for the year ended december  this increase reflects the level of our interest sensitive contracts liabilities and is directly related to income earned on the related funds withheld at interest 
the income earned on funds withheld was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared with  for the year ended december  policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses 
policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  consisting primarily of allowances and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  were approximately  for the year ended december   as compared with  for the year ended december  generally  policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses fluctuate with business volume and changes in product mix 
the increase in these costs reflects the growth and development of our reinsurance business 
other operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  or of total revenue for the year ended december   as compared with  or of total revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in the ratio of operating expenses to total revenue is due to the growth and development of our reinsurance operations and our revenue base 
we consider the operating expense level to be low by industry standards and in line with our plan to be a low cost provider 
financial condition investments cash fixed maturity investments invested assets  including cash and cash equivalents  amounted to approximately  at december  as compared with approximately  at december  the change in invested assets during was due primarily to the receipt of million from a third party reinsurer that is used to fund cedents collateral requirements plus unrealized gains during the period  offset by funds used by the company s operating activities and dividends paid to shareholders 
at december  unrealized gains total approximately  as compared to approximately  at december  the change in unrealized gains is principally related to movement in the general level of interest rates during our investment policy is designed to achieve above average risk adjusted total returns  maintain a high quality portfolio  maximize current income  maintain an adequate level of liquidity and match the cash flows of the portfolio to the required cash flows for the related liabilities 
we do not engage in trading activities to generate realized investment gains and  thus  do not have a trading portfolio 
however  we evaluate the desirability of continuing to hold a security when market conditions  creditworthiness or other measurement factors change 
these changes may relate to a change in the credit risk of an issuer and a decision to sell may be made to avoid further declines in realizable value 
securities also may be sold prior to maturity to provide liquidity 
as a result our securities are classified as available for sale 
at december   fixed maturity investments were investment grade  as compared with at december  the fair value of such investments may vary depending on economic and market conditions  the level of interest rates and the perceived creditworthiness of the issuer 
at december  and  the weighted average duration of invested assets was years  and the weighted average investment quality rating was aa and aa  respectively 
at december    at fair value  or of the invested assets of stockholders equity  consisted of below investment grade securities  as compared with approximately  or of invested assets of stockholders equity at december  we limit our exposure to below investment grade securities to of the amount by which invested assets exceed the related insurance liabilities  as these investments are subject to a higher degree of credit risk than investment grade securities 
we monitor these securities as well as the creditworthiness of the portfolio as a whole 
when fair market values decline for reasons other than changes in interest rates or other perceived temporary conditions  the security is written down to its net realizable value 
at december  there were two impaired securities  which were written down by  at december  there was one impaired security  which was written down by  our results of operations and our financial condition are significantly affected by the performance of our investments and by changes in interest rates 
during a period of declining interest rates  if our investments are prematurely sold  called  prepaid or redeemed  we may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities of equivalent risk with comparable rates of return 
during a period of rising interest rates  the fair value of our invested assets could decline 
in addition  rising interest rates could also cause disintermediation  which in turn could cause us to sell investments at prices and times when the fair values of such investments are less than their amortized cost 
we believe that our traditional life insurance liabilities are not highly interest rate sensitive and  therefore  the effects of fluctuating interest rates on these liability cash flows are not significant 
for interest sensitive liabilities  we are primarily dependent upon the ceding company to utilize asset liability matching or other strategies to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates 
if the ceding company does not appropriately match its asset management strategy to its obligation to its policyholders we could sustain losses  as happened with our largest annuity reinsurance contract 
we have not engaged in hedging activities to mitigate the effects of asset liability mismatches of our cedents  or interest rate changes on our invested assets and related liabilities  although we may do so in the future 
the following table summarizes our investment results  excluding interest earned on funds withheld under modified coinsurance agreements  for the periods ended december    and investment results year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  dollars in thousands total invested assets  including cash and equivalents    investment income  net of related expenses    effective yield rate realized investment gains losses    fair value at end of the indicated year 
the effective yield rate equals i net investment income divided by ii the average of total adjusted invested assets fixed maturities at amortized cost  including assets on deposit with reinsurers at the end of each calendar quarter included in the indicated period 
our invested assets consist primarily of fixed maturity securities 
these fixed maturity securities are invested primarily in us government and us corporate obligations 
at december   mortgage backed securities represented approximately of invested assets  as compared with at december  investors in these securities are compensated primarily for reinvestment risk rather than credit quality risk 
investments in mortgage backed securities include collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s and mortgage backed pass through securities 
mortgage backed securities generally are collateralized by mortgages issued by the government national mortgage association gnma  the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  all of which are agencies of the us government 
of these  only gnma mortgages are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
credit risk generally is not a consideration when investing in agency mortgage backed securities 
our mortgage backed securities portfolio had a weighted average investment quality rating of aaa at both december  and at december   approximately of our mortgage backed investment portfolio consisted of planned amortization class pac  target amortization class tac and sequential instruments  as compared with at december  these investments are designed to amortize in a more predictable manner by shifting the primary risk of prepayment of the underlying collateral to investors in other tranches support classes of the cmo 
funds withheld at interest interest sensitive liabilities contracts 
at december  and assets with a carrying value of  and  respectively  related to annuity reinsurance agreements were held by and managed by the ceding companies in segmented portfolios 
these amounts are included in our balance sheet as funds withheld at interest 
under the terms of the reinsurance agreements  the investment income  which accrues to us  is based on the performance of the underlying portfolios 
assets in the underlying portfolios are managed by investment managers appointed by the cedent 
as a result we cannot directly influence the investment strategy or performance of the portfolio 
the liability for the annuity reinsurance is included on our balance sheet as interest sensitive contracts liabilities  and includes a provision for minimum interest guarantees expected to be paid in the future 
while management has made what it believes to be adequate provision for future costs based upon reasonable assumptions about future investment performance and surrenders  the provision is an estimate 
actual amounts paid may be significantly higher or lower than the current provision 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources are a measure of our overall financial strength and our ability to generate cash flows from our operations to meet operating and growth needs 
our principal sources of funds are premiums received  net investment income  proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold  funds drawn from our collateral funding facility described below  and cash and short term investments 
the principal obligations and uses of the funds are the payment of policy benefits  acquisition and operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
during  we entered into a reinsurance agreement with a third party reinsurer to cede excess us statutory reserves the amount by which the cedents us statutory reserves exceeds our us gaap reserves for certain life insurance contracts subject to certain state statutory regulations known as triple x to the reinsurer 
under the agreement  the reinsurer is obligated to fund the collateral requirements associated with these excess us statutory reserves by making cash deposits with us 
as of december   we had received deposits of million from the reinsurer 
we expect to cede additional excess us statutory reserves to  and receive additional deposits from  the reinsurer in the future 
this reinsurance agreement does not qualify for reinsurance accounting under us gaap 
as a result  funds received under this contract are recorded as a deposit liability 
as part of this contract we deposited million with the reinsurer  which is included in deposits and other reinsurance receivables 
we receive the benefit of investment income from the funds received and pay the third party reinsurer certain fees associated with the contract 
for the year  the fees were million and are included in other insurance expenses 
net cash used by operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared with cash provided by operations of  for the year ended december  the use of cash by our operating activities is primarily related to the net loss incurred for the year and its related payments 
at december  our total capitalization  which consists entirely of equity  was  we believe this level of capital is sufficient to support our insurance writings and growth for the near future 
however  as a bermuda reinsurer we are required to post collateral for the statutory reserves ceded to us by us based insurers and reinsurers 
on march  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register under the securities act of  of senior debt to be sold in one or more transactions on a delayed basis 
we may issue some or all of this debt in the future 
this debt  if and when issued  would be used to fund collateral requirements of our cedents 
in the future  we may issue additional debt or other forms of capital to assist in meeting the collateralization needs of our cedents 
during our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to  of our common stock 
while our board has given us the flexibility to repurchase our common stock in the future if market conditions so dictate  at the present time we anticipate utilizing this capital in the future to support our business growth 
at december  and we had no outstanding debt 
at december  and  letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively  issued in the ordinary course of our business had been issued by our bankers in favor of certain ceding insurance companies to provide security and meet regulatory requirements 
at december  and letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively  were fully collateralized by our investments 
we may incur indebtedness in the future for investment or operational purposes 
during the year the board of directors declared and paid quarterly shareholder dividends of 
per share 
the board intends to continue to declare and pay out of earnings a quarterly dividend 
the continued payment of dividends is dependent on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to achieve satisfactory underwriting and investment results  and no assurance can be given that dividends will be declared or paid in the future 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  acquisition on june  the company  through annuity and life re america  completed the acquisition of annuity and life reassurance america  inc  formerly capitol bankers life insurance company 
annuity and life reassurance america is a life insurance company domiciled in the united states which is authorized to conduct its life insurance business in states of the united states  and will focus its operations on the united states life reinsurance markets 
the company contributed additional capital to annuity and life reassurance america during of  to bring the total capital and surplus of annuity and life reassurance america to  the acquisition price and capital contribution was funded from available cash balances and proceeds from the sales of fixed maturity securities held by the company 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the operating results of annuity and life reassurance america have been included in the company s financial statements since the date of acquisition 
prior to closing  the inforce insurance business of annuity and life reassurance america was reinsured by annuity and life reassurance america with its former owner  a subsidiary of swiss re  who will continue to administer the business reinsured 
accordingly  there will be no earnings from the in force business at the acquisition date accruing to the company currently or in the future 
the amounts related to the reinsured business referred to above are included on the company s balance sheet in the assets as receivable for reinsurance ceded and in the liabilities as reserves for future policy benefits 
at december  and these amounts were million and million  respectively 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired the capital and surplus of annuity and life reassurance america by  which has been allocated to the value of the insurance licenses of annuity and life reassurance america 
this is being amortized over years 
see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding sfas no 
the proforma balance sheet of annuity and life reassurance america as of the date of acquisition after giving effect to the reinsurance transaction is as follows assets cash and invested assets  receivable for reinsurance ceded  insurance licenses  total assets  liabilities and stockholders equity reserves for future policy benefits  stockholders equity  total liabilities and stockholders equity  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates  primarily in the united states  because we have a portfolio of fixed maturity investments 
a change in interest rates will affect the fair value of our investments and may affect our operating results and financial condition 
interest rate risk is managed with effective maturity structures and with the application of duration management practices 
we have no significant foreign currency risk or market risk arising from general account equity securities 
we do have significant market risk from our largest annuity reinsurance contract and minor market and currency risk through our remaining annuity reinsurance agreements 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments such as futures and options to manage risk in our general account or assumed through our reinsurance agreements  although we may do so in the future 
we manage other risks  including credit and liquidity  in the normal course of business 
in managing credit risk we establish overall quality and rating guidelines and place limits on credit exposure by issuer industry to achieve appropriate diversification in the portfolio 
we do not have a trading portfolio and are not exposed to market risk from trading activities 
there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  the table below expressed in millions of us dollars presents as of december  the amortized cost amounts and related weighted average interest rates by years of maturity for our investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities are included in the table by anticipated year of maturity 
cash and cash weighted average fixed maturity weighted average weighted average interest rates by maturity equivalents interest rate investments interest rate dollars in thousands thereafter  total   fair value   sensitivity analysis and duration modeling are used to estimate changes in fair values of fixed maturity investments and the potential effects on operating earnings and cash flows resulting from possible near term changes in interest rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
durations of fixed maturity investments are adjusted for call  put and reset features 
portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income 
our duration model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
the duration model produces a loss in fair value of the fixed maturity investments of approximately million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  conversely  gains of similar amounts will be produced with a basis point decrease in interest rates 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in fair values assumed in this disclosure  especially since the analysis does not and cannot reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate losses or to optimize gains in fair values 
we believe that our life insurance liabilities are not highly interest rate sensitive as they arise from traditional reinsurance arrangements and  therefore  the effects of fluctuating interest rates on these liability cash flows are not significant 
the annuity product line is generally regarded as market and interest rate sensitive 
fluctuations in the general level of interest rates may cause fluctuations in the results of operations 
the future earnings and cash flows of the annuity product line are primarily dependent on earning a spread the difference between the interest earned on the supporting asset base and the rate credited to policyholders and persistency of the underlying business 
all assets supporting interest sensitive liabilities are managed by the company s cedents  or their designated asset managers 
if the assets managed by the cedents do not accumulate at rates sufficient to meet state mandated minimum guarantees prior to the policyholder surrendering the policy  the company could be forced to fund these minimum guarantees resulting in losses to the company 
if the surrender rates significantly exceed the company s expectations during a time period when the assets have not accumulated at a rate sufficient to fund the minimum interest guarantees  losses to the company could be significant
