item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since its inception in january  the company has been engaged in the development of hemodialysis products and services for patients suffering from esrd 
the company has developed the phd system  which is designed to enable patients to perform daily hemodialysis at alternate sites  such as the patient s home 
the company has never generated sales revenue and has incurred losses since its inception 
at december   the company had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
the company expects to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future at least until such time that it can sufficiently commercialize the phd system  with commercialization requiring necessary regulatory clearances or approvals from the fda to market the phd system in the united states and equivalent regulatory approvals to market the phd system in countries other than the united states 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accrued liabilities and contingencies the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable to determine the amount of accrued liabilities and contingencies to be recorded 
if actual results differ from these estimates  additional expenditures might be recorded 
other receivable write down and realizability determinations the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the company s review and assessment of its third party vendor ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s third party vendor were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
net deferred tax assets valuation the company records its net deferred tax assets in the amount that it expects to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of its valuation  assumptions and estimates are required such as the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

joint development income 
on june   the company entered into a co development and license agreement with teijin

the agreement was amended in  and final revenue under the co development agreement was recognized during research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a one time charge in of approximately million 
during  the company determined that the phd systems built for clinical trials  plus additional components to be used for the future manufacture of phd systems  would differ from the version of the phd system that will eventually be commercialized  resulting in the one time charge of approximately million to write those assets down to a carrying value of zero 
business development expenses 
during  business development expenses decreased million  from million in to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to costs related to execution of the co development and licensing agreement with teijin 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million to million 
the increase is primarily a result of additions to the senior management team during the middle of interest income 
for the year ended december   interest income was million  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to interest earned on the net proceeds from the company s private equity financings in  totaling million 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily through public and private sales of its equity securities 
through december   the company had received net offering proceeds from public and private sales of equity securities of approximately million 
since its inception in through december   the company made million of capital expenditures and used million in cash to support its operations 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  working capital of million and restricted long term investments of million 
the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
on march   the company announced receipt of fda clearance to market the phd system in the united states 
the fda clearance had no restrictions and included authorization to use the product in the home 
additional capital will be required to fund operations for a full scale commercialization launch 
it is the company s plan to raise the additional capital required to fund full scale commercial operations through public or private equity or debt financings 
the additional capital required for full scale commercialization may not be available with terms agreeable to the company 
in the event the company cannot raise sufficient capital for a full scale commercial launch  the company believes that cash and short term investments as of december  are sufficient to finance the company s operations through december   under a scaled back commercial launch 
generally  the company expects us customers to purchase phd systems and enter into contracts whereby the company will provide all products and services related to the phd systems for a single monthly price  which would include all consumables  service and product support 
as an alternative  us customers may enter into lease agreements for the phd systems  under which the single monthly price would also include a lease payment 
the company s present commercialization plan for markets outside of the united states is to develop a partnership in those markets to distribute the phd system and related consumables and services 
financing production of the phd system in quantities necessary for commercialization will require a significant investment in working capital 
this need for working capital is likely to increase to the extent that demand for the phd system increases 
the company would  therefore  have to rely on sources of capital beyond cash generated from operations to finance production of the phd system even if the company were successful in marketing its products and services 
the company currently intends to finance the working capital requirements associated with these arrangements through the equity or debt financings to achieve its business objectives 
the company has not yet obtained a commitment for any such financings  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s funding needs will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs associated with continued progress in research and development  the results of clinical studies  manufacturing scale up  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products 
in the event that the company s plans change  its assumptions change or prove inaccurate or it is unable to obtain production financing on commercially reasonable terms  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated 
in addition  in the future the company will require substantial additional financing to fund full scale production and marketing of the phd system and related services 
the company has no current arrangements with respect to sources of additional financing 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities
