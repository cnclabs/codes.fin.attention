item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those encompassed within such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth herein under the caption additional factors that may affect future performance 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our results during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our fiscal years discussed in this annual report began on june and ended on may unless otherwise noted  all references to a particular year refer to our fiscal year 
ndchealth is a leading provider of health information services that add value to the pharmacy  hospital  physician  pharmaceutical and payer businesses 
until  ndchealth  formerly known as national data corporation  provided both health information and electronic payment services 
on january   global payments inc was spun off to the stockholders of ndchealth 
during fiscal years and we closed a number of locations  consolidated numerous clearinghouses  reduced overhead expenditures  rationalized our product lines  divested several operations and discontinued our management services business 
as additional information  we have included exhibit ii and iii which reconcile our historical gaap results to historical results that have been normalized to reflect the core operation that remains from this restructuring program 
since the spin off of global payments  we have operated solely as a network based healthcare information company 
as we entered  our primary objectives were to continue to enhance our operating performance 
continue to strengthen our sales and marketing programs 
further optimize our product management function 
further strengthen the human resource talent in our organization 
we believe we have made great strides in accomplishing these objectives 

table of contents operating performance a comparison of to financial results shows the following revenue grew nearly to million from million 
excluding divested businesses  revenue grew to million from million 
operating income grew to million from million 
a portion of this increase was due to our adoption of sfas goodwill and other intangible assets sfas which is more fully discussed below under financial review 
operating income margin increased from to 
a portion of this increase was due to our adoption of sfas  which is more fully discussed below under financial review 
net income before discontinued operations declined to million from million 
net income before discontinued operations excluding the non cash valuation adjustment in our medunite investment grew to million from million 
a portion of this increase was due to our adoption of sfas  which is more fully discussed below under financial review 
diluted eps before discontinued operations declined to from 
diluted eps before discontinued operations and excluding the non cash valuation adjustment in our medunite investment grew to from 
a portion of this increase was due to our adoption of sfas  which is more fully discussed below under financial review 
return on equity  excluding shares issued in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in techrx  declined to from 
return on equity excluding the non cash valuation adjustment in our medunite investment and shares issued in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in techrx grew to from 
previously issued results for and have been retroactively adjusted as the result of two accounting changes 
eitf resulted in a reclassification of revenues related to sales to physician systems vendors  requiring certain vendor allowances to be treated as deductions from revenue 
also  due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in techrx  apb required us to retroactively account for techrx as if we had used the equity method  rather than the cost method  since our initial investment 
further discussion of these changes appears below under application of critical accounting policies 
results for have been impacted by the application of the provisions of sfas based on information received from the financial advisors to the medunite board of directors  as well as an updated evaluation of medunite s results and capital market conditions  we determined that the value of medunite had declined  and that the decline was not temporary 
we reduced the carrying value of our investment in medunite to million with a non cash charge 
this charge reduced net income by million and diluted earnings per share by for fiscal sales marketing results we signed over new information management customers over the last two years 
intelligent network transactions in grew by over due to new customers  growth from existing customers  and sales of new types of transactions to current customers  such as our pre and post editing services 

table of contents we increased our physician practice management systems unit distribution by with our new upgraded versions of our medisoft v and lytec software 
product strategy most of our new products are developed with the objective to increase recurring revenue 
new solutions which were developed in the current year included we developed our new host based epremis solution that will help our hospital customers accelerate their cash flow 
we developed new pharmacy information solutions to help reduce pharmacy inventory shrinkage and new sophisticated real time edits to help our pharmacy customers grow their revenues and reduce their costs 
in our information management segment  we introduced many new products  including our new suite of phast audit products  our year in review reference tool for the pharmaceutical industry  our weekly payer product  and a new syndicated medical repository which links physician diagnosis information to de identified patient prescription information 
people we believe we also had a successful year in strengthening all levels of our organization 
we continue to upgrade our management development programs 
we continue to strengthen our performance management programs 
we continue to improve employee satisfaction as measured by our satisfaction survey 
we implemented a new diversity program 
our employees are the key to taking advantage of our opportunities and attaining our goals 
we feel we have highly qualified and skilled employees who are committed to ndchealth s success and therefore to their own success 

table of contents looking forward to fy our priorities for focus on leveraging our position across the spectrum of healthcare  and continuing to develop our sales and marketing excellence 
we will also continue to improve our operational processes and strengthen the talent of our people 
on may  we completed three transactions that expanded our ability to create solutions through business agreements with techrx  scriptline  and cardinal health  as discussed in greater detail below 
we believe these transactions will not only enhance our pharmacy market position but will also provide us with a broader platform for creating new healthcare solutions in the future 
relationships and alliances techrx acquisition in may  we acquired a controlling interest in techrx 
techrx was founded in to develop pharmacy information systems  and currently approximately of pharmacies in north america use its solutions 
its systems provide customers with an integrated solution for in store operations and connectivity to payers and physicians 
techrx systems automate the entire prescription fulfillment process for the pharmacy 
this process includes receipt of the prescription and physician interaction  data entry and drug utilization review  dispensing  filling and labeling the prescription  verification and validation  delivery of the prescription and inventory management  and counseling the patient and assisting with patient compliance techrx is completing the development of a first of its kind next generation pharmacy system  t rex one 
roll out of a beta version to independent pharmacies has begun  with roll out of an enterprise version to major chain pharmacies planned in calendar year the new system is designed to address the acute shortage of pharmacists today and to provide functionality to move certain processes from the pharmacy to central locations and chain headquarters 
the new applications are known in the industry as central patient management  central processing and central fill 
these 
table of contents applications are designed to maximize workflow efficiency  reduce inventory carrying costs and allow for integrated processing of electronic prescriptions 
with the availability of the new techrx technology  chain pharmacies will be able to implement enterprise wide applications 
as an example  one of the many immediate benefits to the patient will be the ability to quickly refill a prescription at any store within the chain  rather than only the store originally called by the physician 
by gaining a controlling interest in techrx  we acquire a number of valuable assets including an extensive customer base  a premier application development team  and state of the art next generation software 
to techrx  we will add operational efficiencies and our substantial sales and marketing resources  as well as our industry leadership position 
we expect to gain immediate cost synergies from the leveraging of these assets 
scriptline acquisition in may  we acquired selected assets of scriptline 
scriptline is a leading provider of value added edits for healthcare claims which enhance the profitability of pharmacies 
scriptline complements our existing pharmacy network services business and expands the comprehensive suite of edits available to the combined pharmacy customer bases of both organizations 
one of the fastest growing facets of the pharmacy transaction market today is pre and post edits 
the combined product offering will compliment our market leading position and increase our market presence in this rapidly growing editing market segment 
scriptline also adds volume and scale to our existing network operations  increasing our leverage and improving margins going forward 
we intend to integrate scriptline directly into our pharmacy network platform and we expect to gain immediate cost synergies in processing  marketing  customer support and product development 
cardinal health alliance in may  we also entered into a strategic alliance with the pharmaceutical distribution and provider services segment of cardinal health to jointly market and develop products and services for the healthcare industry 
as part of the alliance  ndchealth editing services under the scriptline brand will continue to be offered to pharmacies exclusively by cardinal health 
the alliance also provides for joint development between ndchealth and cardinal of additional marketing programs  products and services 

table of contents cegedim alliance in december  we announced a joint venture with cegedim  sa in the united kingdom 
we have combined our informatics businesses to broaden the product offerings to pharmaceutical manufacturers in the uk under the name infopharm 
the financial results of the joint venture are recorded on the income statement as equity in losses of affiliated companies 
medunite alliance during july  in exchange for the assets of our physician network services business  we received an equity interest and became an investor in medunite  inc along with the following leading us health insurance companies aetna  anthem  cigna  health net  oxford  pacificare  and wellpoint health networks 
medunite offers a nationwide transaction network to connect providers and payers 
we exclusively market medunite s physician network services to customers using our practice management systems 
as a provider of physician software  our objective in our alliance with medunite is to provide additional application capabilities for our physician customers 
as previously reported  we have continued to monitor our investment in medunite in light of medunite s progress in executing on its business strategy and in seeking and evaluating proposals for its proposed recapitalization 
as reflected in our financial statements included in this form k  we have taken a non cash charge to write down the carrying value of our investment in medunite 
on august   the financial advisors to medunite s board of directors shared with us that they had evaluated several preliminary proposals and selected parties with which they intend to proceed with further evaluation discussions and negotiation of a potential recapitalization transaction 
in addition  we understand that other parties have recently indicated their interest in potentially submitting a proposal to medunite 
based upon this information  as well as an updated evaluation of medunite s results and of capital market conditions  we have determined that the carrying value of medunite has declined and that such decline is not temporary 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities we have reduced the carrying value of our investment in medunite to million by way of a non cash charge reflected in our financial statements for the year ended may  this charge is described more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we continue to believe that our relationship with medunite provides important strategic value to ndchealth 
we believe that a recapitalized medunite will continue to offer us the ability to provide the additional application capabilities of medunite s physician network services to our physician customers 
we continue to be optimistic with respect to the potential to increase the number of us physicians who submit claims electronically and that such an increase should allow us to receive a growing revenue stream from our association with medunite 

table of contents in fiscal year  revenue related to medunite was approximately million 
additionally  at may  we had a note receivable from medunite  including accrued interest  of approximately million and a convertible note receivable  including accrued interest  of approximately million 
global payments because of the nature of certain systems shared by global payments and ourselves prior to the spin off  we jointly determined that it was in the best interest of both companies for us to continue to provide services to global payments utilizing these systems 
therefore  we entered into a network services agreement whereby we provide transaction processing services for global payments 
global payments reimburses us for these services at a rate that approximates our costs and is established annually 
the initial term of the agreement ends january  and is extendable for two additional years 
in addition  global payments currently occupies an office building we own that is adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
we maintain the building  which global payments occupied prior to the spin off  as a part of our corporate campus 
as part of the spin off agreement  the building is currently leased to global payments at a rate that approximates our cost of maintaining the building for a term ending january  business landscape and competitive forces overall landscape of the business on a macro level  we grow as our customers grow 
our markets continue to be influenced by favorable macroeconomic trends such as an aging population  expected steady increase in prescription drug use as new drugs are made available  increasing rates of conversion from manual to electronic systems  growth in pharmacy sales among the largest us pharmacy chains  pending federal legislation to stimulate more electronic transaction processing  and demand for increasingly sophisticated information products and market intelligence by pharmaceutical manufacturers and others in the healthcare industry 
there are also growth drivers that are specific to ndchealth 
the five major ndchealth specific categories of revenue growth that we visualize are we have a large  under penetrated customer base that uses only a small percentage of our existing products and services  we have broad distribution channels to add new customers  
table of contents we have a significant pipeline of new products to market to existing and prospective customers  we are expanding into new markets such as the international and the payer arenas  and through acquisitions and alliances  we can selectively expand our service offerings  geographic reach and distribution channels 
competitive forces as mentioned in item business of this annual report on form k  we have a number of competitors 
we compete with in house capabilities of healthcare organizations 
we compete with other vendors of information products and services in the healthcare information industry such as ims health  verispan  and arclight 
we compete with other providers of transaction services such as webmd and we compete with direct connections to payers 
we also compete with a number of small vendors of pharmacy  physician  provider  and hospital solutions 
a key factor for our success in the competitive landscape is speed to market of innovative new products and product enhancements that provide benefit to our customers 
products added in include ndc prescription price reporter enables retail pharmacies to optimize their cash prescription pricing in their regional market 
this new product allows for the analysis of cash pricing for the top multi source brand generic drugs for every dispensed quantity by geography 
it also features web delivery  an easily accessible solution for pharmacies of all sizes 
ndc pharmaceutical audit suite phast is a powerful audit tool that allows pharmaceutical manufacturers access to a unique combination of retail  institutional and mail order pharmaceutical sales data 
this robust product is used for forecasting  competitive analysis  sales targeting and profiling and sales performance measurement 
institution sales analyzer is a comprehensive web based data resource that provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with extensive capabilities to track and analyze sales information in us non retail institutions  including highly specific geographic and outlet affiliated levels of detail 
this data is essential information for pharmaceutical product managers  market research analysts and sales management responsible for a variety of strategic planning  sales and performance evaluations 
with our recent acquisition of a majority interest in techrx  we have rolled out a beta version of t rex one  a first of its kind next generation pharmacy system  to independent pharmacies 
we expect to roll out t rex one to major chains in calendar year the new system is designed to provide functionality to move certain processes from the individual pharmacy to central locations and chain headquarters 
the 
table of contents new applications are known in the industry as central patient management  central processing and central fill applications 
we recently began beta testing of epremis  a new browser based version of our hospital solution that helps ensure the accuracy and completeness of submitted claims 
this new product offers our customers an enhanced set of editing services that can be accessed from any terminal in the hospital giving maximum flexibility and personnel efficiency 
epremis will be available as both a turn key system installed in the hospital or as a remotely hosted application centrally managed by ndchealth 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue although we have several sources of revenue  in all cases  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectibility is probable 
the most variable of these factors between our various businesses is determining when delivery has occurred 
in our information management segment  we have two primary sources of revenue database information reporting and consulting services 
database information reporting typically involves the delivery of products providing pharmaceutical information 
these include products where delivery is completed at one point in time and products where delivery is made over a period of time 
revenue for products involving a single delivery is recognized when obligations to the customer have been fulfilled  which is typically upon delivery 
products that are delivered over a period of time are generally unique in nature and therefore require more complex judgment to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
in most cases  information of a similar type is delivered at equal intervals over a fixed period of time in which case revenue is recognized over the terms of the contract using a straight line model 
because we must make estimates of the data and effort that will be required to deliver these types of products in the future  there are risks that more or less effort may actually be required at a future time and that the revenue recognized at that time may not correspond to the level of effort required for product delivery 

table of contents our consulting services are typically provided for a fixed fee over a specific period of time 
because the terms of these contracts are very specific  revenue for these services is recognized using the percentage of completion model over the term of the contract 
if we determine that we will incur a loss on a contract  we recognize the loss at the time the determination is made 
these contracts typically average to months 
in our network services and systems segment  the primary source of revenue is transaction fees charged for network services 
we provide these services to our pharmacy  hospital  physician  and payer customers 
these fees are generally based on the volume of services we provide to each individual customer 
in most instances  this fee is charged per transaction and type of transaction while in some instances  these services are provided to large customers for a fixed monthly fee  regardless of each month s actual transaction volume 
revenue for these services is recognized each month as the services are rendered 
in our systems businesses  we also receive revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and support agreements 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
these sop s provide guidance on applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for software revenue recognition transactions 
revenues from the sale of software licenses and implementation services are recognized upon the date that the software is in operation at the customer site where vendor specific objective evidence vsoe has been established for the undelivered elements of the customer contract  which typically is maintenance 
in these cases  the maintenance revenue and associated costs are recognized over the term of the maintenance contract 
where vsoe cannot be established for undelivered elements within the contract  the revenue and associated costs for implementation services are deferred and recognized upon acceptance over the remaining term of the contract  typically two or three years 
the software we license to our customers is generally one of two types 
the most common software type is used by our customers to manage their businesses and connect to our network 
because this type of software has stand alone functionality meaning that connection to our network is not required for the software to be functional  we recognize revenue for sales of these products when the product is shipped  if it is installed by the customer  or when installed by us or one of our affiliates 
the other type of software is software used by our customers to process transactions through our network 
because this software provides value to our customers only to the extent that they are utilizing our network services  revenue is recognized over the estimated life of the network services contract rather than when the software is shipped or installed 
we provide software maintenance and customer support to our customers on both an as needed and long term basis 
services provided outside a maintenance contract are 
table of contents on an as requested basis and revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue for services provided on a long term basis is recognized ratably over the terms of the contract 
during  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
many of our physician systems are sold indirectly through value added resellers vars 
because the vars are providing many of the services that we would otherwise provide such as contract support  advertising  etc  we have historically provided them certain allowances to cover their cost of providing these services 
historically  we had recorded revenue relating to the sale of systems through vars at full price the same list price we sell directly to end users and recorded the allowances as expense 
we now record revenue in accordance with eitf which generally requires that such allowances be treated as reductions in revenue 
as required by eitf  fiscal and revenue was reduced by million and million  respectively 
also during  we entered into an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement with techrx under which we agreed to acquire techrx in a two step transaction 
because we are now the controlling shareholder  our financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to account for techrx as an equity investment since the initial investment as required by accounting principal board opinion no 
 equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb 
the adjustments required by apb are a reduction in revenue of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
intangible assets intangible assets are created when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the value of its physical assets 
for any significant business we acquire  we obtain a valuation from an independent specialist who identifies any specific intangibles and provides an estimated value and life for each 
goodwill exists where our purchase price exceeds the value of physical assets plus these specifically identified intangible assets 
specified intangible assets primarily represent developed software and customer relationships 
identified intangibles are assigned a value  generally that which was estimated in the valuation  and amortized over the estimated life 
because of the complexity of assumptions and judgment used in estimating the value and life of these assets  there is significant risk that their actual value and life may vary from the original estimate 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of intangibles may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an intangible should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the present value of future cash flows associated with the asset over its remaining life 
we may determine that an intangible asset has diminished or has no remaining value prior to it being fully amortized 
in this instance  we would be required to incur a charge to earnings to impair the asset 

table of contents in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted this new standard in the first quarter of one of the underlying assumptions of sfas is that goodwill doesn t have a determinable useful life 
however  it is possible to compare the carrying value of the goodwill to the underlying value of the business 
as such  sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment on a regular basis 
as part of our adoption of sfas  we completed our initial impairment tests during the second quarter of by comparing the present value of the estimated future cash flows of each of our reporting units to the book value of that unit s assets 
our reporting units are defined as our pharmacy  hospital  and physician businesses in our network services and systems segment plus our total information management segment 
for each of our reporting units  we found that the present value of each unit s estimated future cash flows exceeded the net book value of the unit and therefore no impairment was necessary 
due to the size of the techrx and scriptline acquisitions  we reviewed our test as of may  and found that no adjustments were required 
if the estimated current value of future cash flows of any unit had been lower than its book value  we would have performed additional tests to determine the magnitude of impairment 
any impairment would require a non cash charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment was identified 
we will conduct these same tests going forward at least annually to ensure that goodwill carried on our balance sheet is properly valued 
capitalized software internally developed software held as property on our balance sheet consists of two types  software that we develop for sale to our customers and software that we develop that is used internally to provide services to our customers 
the costs associated with developing this software are capitalized differently depending on whether the software is for sale or for internal use 
in each instance  in accordance with sfas costs are capitalized only when the project has reached the point of technological feasibility or the application development stage 
costs incurred prior to this point are charged to earnings as research and development expense 
for software sold to our customers  in accordance with sfas we capitalize both direct and indirect development costs such as programmers salaries  outside contractor costs  computer time  and allocated facility costs 
for software used internally  in accordance with sop direct development costs such as programmers salaries and fees paid to others for development are capitalized 
in each instance  completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the greater of the amount computed using the straight line method or the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues  based on the estimated useful life of the project  normally five years 
this life is based on the projected period of time that we will either sell the product or use the product to provide services 
the actual useful life of the product may be longer or shorter than the estimated useful life 
if the actual life is longer  we 
table of contents would continue to realize value from the asset while no longer recognizing a corresponding expense 
if the actual life is shorter and we determine that the investment will not be recovered through the future sales of products or services  a non cash charge to earnings could be required 
the net realizable value of capitalized software is monitored on a periodic basis to ensure that the investment will be recovered through the future sale of products or services 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we extend credit to our customers for products and services they purchase from us 
monies due us are shown on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
while we collect the vast majority of these receivables  we historically have been unable to collect a fraction of the accounts  or portions thereof 
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will be uncollectible and is determined by reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable 
as we review our accounts as part of our collections process  accounts or portions thereof deemed to be uncollectible or to require excessive collection costs are written off to the allowance 
because our allowance is based on estimated uncollectibility  amounts that are actually uncollectible could be higher or lower 
if the amounts are lower than expected  a credit to earnings could result whereas if the amounts are higher  an additional charge to earnings could be required 
our provision for bad debt expense over the past two years has been less than of total revenue 
data costs we purchase data from a variety of sources primarily for use in our information products 
this data is used in a variety of products and services as described above under revenue 
these data costs are typically held in inventory at the time of purchase with the majority expensed during one  or over several  months depending on the timing of payments for the data and as products utilizing the data are delivered to customers 
occasionally  we expand our product offerings by modifying our current products for a new market 
in these cases  additional or new types of data costs may be incurred in developing the history database for these new products and we defer the additional data costs 
these data costs are then amortized over the average life of the contracts for the new products  generally one to three years 
investments we consider and selectively enter into a variety of alliances  joint ventures and investments 
as such  we maintain investments in both privately held and publicly traded entities 
our investments in privately held entities are accounted for under either the cost  equity  or consolidation method  whichever is appropriate for the particular investment 
the appropriate method is determined by our ability to exercise significant influence over the investee  through either quantity of voting stock or other means 
we regularly review our investments for impairment issues and propriety of current accounting treatment 
the primary method we use to determine whether or not an impairment issue exists is to 
table of contents compare the valuation of our investment with the underlying value of the entity in which we have an investment 
we can determine the underlying value of the entity based on a number of factors  including the execution of business strategy and the steps that it has and is taking in the execution of that strategy  and the entity s subsequent financing activity 
if we determine that an impairment issue exists  we would realize the loss in other income expense in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
if we determine that our accounting treatment should change from the cost to equity method  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 equity method of accounting for investments in common stock we would be required to retroactively restate our previously issued financial statements as if we had always accounted for the investment under the equity method 
if our level of investment increased to a level such that we directly or indirectly controlled the entity  we would consolidate the entity s results into our consolidated financial statements 
we have continued to monitor our investment in medunite in light of medunite s progress in executing its business strategy and in seeking and evaluating proposals for its proposed recapitalization 
as reflected in our financials statements  we have taken a non cash charge writing down the carrying value of our investment in medunite 
on august   the financial advisors to medunite s board of directors shared with us that they had evaluated several preliminary proposals and selected parties with which they intend to proceed with further evaluation discussions and negotiation of a potential recapitalization transaction 
in addition  we understand that other parties have recently indicated their interest in potentially submitting a proposal to medunite 
based upon this information  as well as an updated evaluation of medunite s results and of capital market conditions  we determined that the carrying value of medunite had declined and that the decline was not temporary 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities we reduced the carrying value of our investment in medunite to million by way of a non cash charge reflected in our financial statements for the year ended may  this charge is described more fully in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the charge reduced our previously announced fiscal net income by million  after application of a million tax benefit  and reduced previously announced fiscal diluted earnings per share by 
our investments in publicly traded entities are classified as available for sale securities and are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported  net of taxes  as a component of stockholders equity 
for example  if the market price of our investment has declined but we believe that the decline is only temporary because the underlying value of the business is higher than the market indicates  we will report the value of our investment at the price indicated by the market and report any change in the investment s value as an unrealized holding loss 
when a decline is determined to be other than temporary  we realize the gain or loss in other income expense 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make other estimates and assumptions in addition to those discussed above 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and requires that discontinued operations be measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we have evaluated this statement  and it does not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections  which clarifies the criteria under which extinguishments of debt can be considered as extraordinary and rescinds the related statement nos 
  and and also makes technical corrections to other statements of financial standards 
we believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our future results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and nullifies eitf we do not believe that this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
however  the statement will likely change the timing of recognition of any future restructuring activity 

table of contents financial review we operate our business as two fundamental segments network services and systems  and information management 
network services and systems provides electronic connectivity to our ndchealth intelligent network and system solutions throughout the healthcare industry 
information management provides management information  research  and consulting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers  pharmacy chains and hospitals 
other includes results from divested businesses  restructuring and impairment charges  income related to gains from the sale of securities  income related to gains on business divestitures  and expense related to non cash losses on investments in medscape and medunite

table of contents services offered to new and existing customers and our start up operations in europe 
the increase from to was due to increased sales in europe and the us of contracted projects 
network services and systems revenue grew from million in to million in and to million in the growth from to was due to increased demand for our services in the pharmacy and hospital markets resulting from growth in customer base and transaction volume and the favorable impact of the medisoft acquisition in april the increase from to was due to increased transaction volumes and growth in customer base in the pharmacy and hospital markets and increased revenue from our network adjudication for pharmacies 
revenue from divested businesses other accounted for million  million and million in   and respectively 
network services and systems revenue was negatively impacted by two accounting changes in as previously discussed  our adoption of eitf in required the reclassification of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  from revenue to operating expense 
also  as a result of our increased equity investment in techrx  apb required a retroactive adjustment to account for techrx as an equity investment since our initial investment 
this adjustment required a reduction in revenue of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
operating income operating income grew from million in to million in and to million in a portion of the increase in operating income from to was due to our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas deals with  among other things  amortization of goodwill 
because goodwill was no longer amortized in  amortization expense decreased million from the remainder of the increase from to was due primarily to increased leverage of our infrastructure 
because of the fixed costs inherent in our business model  we have the ability to increase operating income at a higher rate than revenue 
excluding the impact of sfas in  operating income increased from versus the increase in revenue 
operating income in both and was negatively impacted by restructuring and impairment charges 
during the second quarter of  executive management decided to focus attention on our core information management and network services and systems businesses and actions were initiated to eliminate non core as well as obsolete and redundant product and service offerings 
in addition  we accelerated clearinghouse integration  consolidation of locations  and associated staff and expense reductions 
as a result  a restructuring and impairment charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of and categorized as follows 
table of contents total cash non cash in millions impairment of goodwill and other intangibles impairment of property and equipment closed or planned closings of facilities estimated costs for settlements on contracts severance and related costs total approximately million were cash items that were accrued at the time the charges were incurred 
the charges relating to facilities represent the locations that were either already closed or had management approved plans to close within the next six months 
the severance and related costs arose from actions to reduce personnel staffing in areas of redundant operations and activities 
the charges reflect specifically identified executives and employees who were informed during the second quarter of that their employment would be terminated 
there were approximately employees terminated in the consolidation efforts and approximately employees terminated as a part of reductions related to project completions or phase outs 
as these actions were finalized and implemented  an additional million of restructuring and impairment charges were incurred during the second quarter of when both our salt lake city operations and a portion of our cleveland operations were closed 
of this total  approximately million were cash items that were accrued at the time the charges were incurred 
these cash items include severance and related costs of million and facility exit costs of million 
the severance and related costs arose from actions to reduce personnel staffing in areas of redundant operations and activities 
these charges reflect specifically identified executives and employees who were informed of their termination during the second quarter of the facility costs relate to a location that was closed during the quarter 
the remaining million impairment charge was the result of the write down and divestiture of a non core operation 
these restructuring and impairment charges are included in the other segment 
more detailed discussion of these charges is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income in was also negatively impacted by unusual expenses of million which resulted from the programs discussed above but were not a component of the restructuring and impairment charges 
these expenses amounted to million in information management  million in network services and systems  and million in other 
excluding these charges  information management operating income decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the consolidation of four of our largest pharmaceutical customers and losses incurred in our start up operations in europe 
including these charges  information management operating income decreased from million in to million in and increased to million in the increase from to was due to increased revenue  which allows us to leverage our infrastructure  our adoption of sfas  and cost savings discussed below

more information concerning segments can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses our most significant expenses are compensation  data costs  depreciation and amortization  and communications expense 
together these expenses represented over of our operating expenses in expenses that we classify as cost of service include compensation  computer operations  data costs  consulting services  telecommunications  customer support  and application maintenance expenses 
in sales  general and administrative we include compensation  sales  marketing  administration  and corporate overhead expenses 
compensation expense as a service organization  compensation is our largest expense and we must continue to monitor it closely 
in general  we are not always able to pass our inflationary cost increases on to our customers 
as our costs go up  we must find new ways to operate our business in order to reduce costs and improve productivity 
this includes addressing under performing projects  products and people 
as a percent of revenue  compensation expense  which includes incentive pay  commissions  and related fringe benefits  has been decreasing 
this decrease is due to increased productivity as a result of our training initiatives and cost control efforts  divestiture of less productive businesses  and the scalability of our business model 
we will continue to look for ways to improve efficiencies  including centralization  in our businesses 
in millions compensation expense revenue percent of revenue 
table of contents data costs we buy data from various sources to supplement our own data collection efforts

we are actively pursuing programs to contain the increase in data costs 
in millions data cost revenue percent of revenue depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased significantly in due to our adoption of sfas no 
because goodwill was no longer amortized in  amortization expense decreased million from we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in as a result of the techrx and scriptline acquisitions 
in millions depreciation and amortization revenue percent of revenue communications costs communications costs have been declining in terms of dollars and as a percent of revenue 
from to we consolidated our clearinghouses  and between and a number of customers moved to a frame network 
the frame network provides a secure and reliable form of communications at a lower cost than private lines 
we also negotiated new contracts with our vendors under more favorable terms 
we expect that communications costs will continue to decline as a percentage of revenue but may not decrease at the rate we experienced over the last year 
we continue to look at new technologies that will allow us to provide superior service to our customers at reduced cost

this decline in expense margin is due to centralization efforts and cost containments 
we expect that sg a expense will continue to decline as a percentage of revenue but may not decrease at the rate we experienced over the last year liquidity and capital resources payments from our customers are our greatest source of liquidity 
additional sources of liquidity include our revolving line of credit  issuances of common stock and other instruments  financing under capital lease arrangements  and vendor financing 
the cash provided by these sources has a variety of uses 
most importantly  we must pay our employees and vendors for the services and materials they supply 
additional uses include expenditures for new capital equipment  development of additional products  investments in alliances  business acquisitions  payment of taxes  payment of dividends  and extension of credit to our customers 
our operating cash requirements are generally satisfied with our customer receipts because revenue from our customers exceeds our operating expenses 
we receive a higher level of cash from our customers than we expend for payments of salaries and other recurring operating costs  and we manage our receivables and payables effectively 
excess cash that we generate after satisfying all of our continuing operating requirements is shown on our statement of cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a slight decrease from million in this measure takes into account items such as non cash expenses included in our operating income  the cash payment of taxes  cash used to extend credit to our customers  and cash provided by our vendors extending credit to us 
the most significant difference in this measure between and was the source of deferred tax assets used to reduce current tax payments 
deferred tax assets used in were related to restructuring and impairment charges in and as such the cash provided by the use of the assets is displayed in cash flows from operating activities 
the deferred tax assets used in were primarily related to discontinued operations  therefore  the cash provided by the use of these assets is displayed in cash flows from discontinued operations 
this measure provides us an indication of the internally generated funds that we have available to invest in the growth of our business 
during the past three years  we have undertaken a significant initiative to centralize our finance support functions to ensure that cash flow from operating activities is optimized 
in  we consolidated our purchasing and accounts payable functions 
this has allowed us to leverage the buying power of all of our businesses and obtain the best pricing from our vendors and also ensure that payment to these vendors provides us with the best possible terms 
during the latter half of  we centralized our billing and accounts receivable functions 
although this resulted in a temporary increase in accounts receivable at may   we expect that in the benefits of this initiative will be faster billing to our customers and improved collections of accounts receivable 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of to million in the nature of an information services business is such that it requires a substantial continuing investment in technology equipment and product development in order to expand the business 
we are generally able to internally fund these investments from excess cash generated from operations 
additionally  historically we have also expanded our business through acquisitions and strategic investments in other businesses 
the cash we use to expand our business is shown as net cash used in investing activities 
capital expenditures  which reflect our investment in equipment and product development  were million in and million in these investments were funded from cash from operations in both years 
due to the inclusion of techrx in  we expect that these capital investments will be in the range of to million in this increase represents the continuing investment in t rex one  a first of its kind next generation pharmacy system 
during  we acquired a controlling interest in techrx and select assets of scriptline from arclight systems 
these acquisitions used cash totaling million in compared to million for acquisitions in acquisitions in included our german informatics business and a printing services business in the us the acquisitions were funded with excess cash from operations whereas the acquisitions were funded with both borrowings under our line of credit and cash from operations 
the acquisition of a controlling interest in techrx in was the first step of an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of techrx in a two step transaction 
under the second step  which would close on or about may   if certain conditions are met  we will acquire the remaining shares in techrx from minority shareholders for cash  ndchealth shares or a combination of cash and ndchealth shares 
the amount of the payment to techrx shareholders will be determined based upon the satisfaction of certain financial and operational milestones by techrx 
the expected purchase price for the balance of the techrx shares outstanding ranges from approximately million to million 
as previously mentioned  borrowings under our line of credit also provide us an additional source of liquidity 
at the time of the spin off of global payments  we obtained a credit facility with a one year term providing a million unsecured revolving line of credit and an option for us to convert any outstanding borrowings at the maturity date to a term loan repayable at the first anniversary of the initial maturity date 
we exercised this option during the third quarter of and converted million outstanding under the unsecured line of credit to a term loan 
during the fourth quarter of  we obtained a new credit facility providing a million unsecured revolving line of credit and repaid the million term loan 
this new credit facility has a variable interest rate based on market rates and has a three year term 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and non financial covenants customary for financings of this nature  such as requiring us to maintain a certain leverage ratio of debt to adjusted 
table of contents ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined in the credit agreement as net income plus income taxes  interest expense  and non cash charges 
if by may   our obligations under our convertible subordinated notes discussed below have not been paid in full or amended such that they mature after may   the facility will expire on may  we borrowed million under our new facility in in order to partially fund the acquisitions described above 
in  we used million of the million cash dividend from global payments to pay the balance outstanding under our previous line of credit at the time of the spin off 
stock activities provide us an additional source of liquidity 
stock activities are primarily related to the exercises of employee stock options and issues under the employee stock purchase plan 
in  issuance of common shares of ndchealth generated million versus million in although the issuance of additional shares provides us with liquidity  it results in a dilution of each individual stockholder s equity in the company 
we may choose to use cash to repurchase shares to reduce the number of our shares outstanding in order to counteract this dilution 
as mentioned above  the acquisition of the remaining shares of techrx may be paid in cash  ndchealth shares  or a combination of both 
the number of shares issued will depend on the acquisition price  the trading price of ndchealth shares at the time of the transaction  and the form of payment made to techrx shareholders 
we intend to register shares to be used in the second step of the acquisition during fiscal another use of cash is the payment of dividends 
because the amount of our quarterly dividend was reduced in the third quarter of following the spin off of global payments  cash used for payment of dividends decreased to million in from million in as mentioned above  deferred tax assets related to our discontinued operations allowed us to reduce our current cash tax payments by million in we expect these deferred assets to be depleted in the first quarter of discontinued operations also used million in  primarily in the settling of liabilities  versus million in in addition  in we received a cash dividend from global payments inc totaling million 
we currently have million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding that will mature on november  the notes bear interest at per annum and are convertible into approximately  shares of common stock at per share at any time prior to maturity 
we continue to evaluate several options to replace these notes including either  or a combination of  issuing new convertible notes or other equity linked securities or issuing senior debt  and we continue to monitor the capital markets 
the actual effect of any refinancing will depend upon the refinancing option that we select  the timing of the refinancing and the rate that we must pay at that time 
for example  should we refinance the notes in fiscal year by issuing a debt instrument of million  we currently estimate that diluted earnings per share would be negatively impacted by approximately to in fiscal year  plus a one time charge relating to extinguishment of debt of approximately to per diluted share 

table of contents as of may   we have a working capital deficit which means that our current liabilities exceed our current assets 
we believe that our current level of cash on hand  future cash flows from operations  and our revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our operating needs in as described above  we are evaluating various options for replacing our convertible notes including the issuance of new convertible notes or other equity linked securities or senior debt 
a summary of our contractual obligations are presented below payments due by period years years after years total in millions contractual obligations long term debt line of credit capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations outlook for the fiscal year  we estimate that annual revenue will be approximately to million and diluted earnings per share in the range of to  including approximately to million of medunite related revenue 
for the first quarter of  we expect revenue to be in the range of to million  with diluted earnings per share in the range of to 
as previously disclosed  if we elect to refinance our convertible subordinated notes prior to may   we currently estimate that diluted earnings per share would be negatively impacted by approximately to in fiscal  plus a one time charge relating to extinguishment of debt of approximately to per diluted share 
we expect that both of our business segments will continue to benefit from improved operating efficiencies 
for fiscal  we expect that revenue for the information management segment will be in the range of to million 
for network services and systems  we expect that revenue will be in the range of to million  including approximately to million of medunite related revenue 
our markets have significant untapped potential providing us the opportunity to grow our business and generate significant cash flow 
additional factors that may affect future performance in addition to the other information provided in our reports  including this annual report on form k  the following additional risk factors may affect the company s results 
we have provided the following risk factor disclosure in conjunction with our continuing effort to qualify our written and oral forward looking statements for the protection of any safe harbor provision that protects companies from securities law liability in connection with such forward looking statements 
we undertake no 
table of contents obligation to update or revise our forward looking statements or these risk factors to reflect future developments  changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results 
important factors currently known to our management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the disclosures contained in the annual report on form k and also include the following we may experience volatility in our stock price 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant volatility from time to time 
such volatility may be affected by factors such as our quarterly operating results or changes in the economy  financial markets or the healthcare information and transaction processing industries  specifically  or the healthcare industry in general 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which has sometimes affected the market price of the securities issued by a particular company which may be unrelated to the operational performance of the company 
this type of market effect could impact our common stock price as well 
in addition  we may be subject to securities class action litigation if the market price of our stock experiences significant volatility 
our management s attention and resources may be diverted from normal operations if we would become subject to any securities class action  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense competition could damage our sales and profitability 
if we are unable to compete successfully with providers of systems and services similar to ours  we may lose significant revenue 
we compete not only with independent providers of similar systems and services  but also with unrelated businesses internal divisions that provide similar services 
the markets in which we offer our systems and services are highly competitive with respect to functionality of products and services  price  quality and innovation 
competition in the markets in which we offer our systems and services affects our ability to attract new customers and keep existing ones  hire quality employees  and charge prices for our products and services that will maximize our profitability 
some of our competitors have greater access to capital and marketing and technological resources  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully with them 
we may not be able to replace our existing convertible debt on financially attractive terms 
we currently have million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding that will mature on november  we continually monitor the capital markets  and anticipate replacing these notes on favorable terms 
if we refinance in fiscal year by issuing a debt instrument of million  we presently estimate that diluted earnings per share in that year could be reduced by up to  plus a one time charge relating to extinguishment of debt of up to per share 
however  the actual effect of 
table of contents any refinancing will depend upon the refinancing option that we select  the timing of the refinancing  and the rate that we must pay at the time 
adverse rulings in litigation could reduce our results of operations 
our profitability could be affected by the outcome of litigation in europe and in the united states 
our complaint filed before the european commission against ims health  a competitor to our information business  seeking to compel the issuance of a license to allegedly proprietary data structures is presently before the european commission  as well as its courts  and is awaiting a decision 
further  we are currently awaiting judicial determination in germany as to whether or not ims health holds a copyright in this structure 
we are also involved in litigation related to our former physician and hospital support services and hospital management services phss units 
we are unable to predict either the outcome before the european commission or the german courts  or whether we may incur liability stemming from the phss litigation 
liability resulting from adverse rulings could reduce our results of operation and profitability 
we may lose customers or revenue due to consolidation in the healthcare industry 
there has been and continues to be significant consolidation in the healthcare industry  which may reduce the number of existing customers for our services and may reduce the price we are able to charge those customers 
in addition  this consolidation of healthcare providers and pharmaceutical suppliers may reduce the number of our potential customers 
the increased purchasing power of larger consolidated organizations could also lead to reductions in the amounts these organizations are willing to pay for our services 
we cannot predict the overall impact of consolidation in the healthcare industries  and it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the value of our strategic investment in medunite may change with business conditions 
our investment in medunite corporation is presently accounted for under the cost method 
medunite is an early stage venture among a number of leading health service payors and ndchealth 
medunite is currently evaluating several preliminary proposals in conjunction with a potential recapitalization transaction and has selected parties for additional negotiations 
in addition  we understand that other parties have indicated their interest in potentially submitting a proposal to medunite 
the valuation of medunite is dependent upon execution of its business strategy  transactions pursued in the execution of its strategy  and the results of its recapitalization transaction 
reduced growth  underperformance by medunite  or the outcome of the recapitalization transaction could cause us to reassess the carrying value of our investment in medunite and our continued use of the cost method 
a reduced valuation or change in accounting method could reduce our profitability 

table of contents changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our revenues 
in recent years  the healthcare industry  including the healthcare financing and reimbursement system  has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs 
these changes include increased use of managed care  cuts in medicare and medicaid payment and reimbursement levels  consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical surgical supply distributors  and the development of large  sophisticated purchasing groups 
we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future 
some of these changes  such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in the delivery or pricing of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits  may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 
changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers research and distribution policies could also reduce our income 
we are unable to predict the effect of such changes on our operations and profitability 
complex state and federal regulations could depress the demand for information products and we could incur redesign costs or be subject to penalties 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  regulatory and other influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider programs to reform or revise the us healthcare system 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
we are unable to predict future proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they would have on our business 
hipaa administrative simplification under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress required the adoption of rules to establish standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information 
published rules include standards for electronic transactions  published august   standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  published december   and standards for unique employer identifiers  published may  these rules generally restrict the use and disclosure  and mandate security  of personally identifiable health information 
the hipaa rules apply to healthcare providers  health plans  including employer sponsored group health plans  and healthcare clearinghouses  as well as indirectly  in certain instances  to those who provide services on behalf of these entities which involve the receipt of disclosure of health information 
certain of our operations will be subject to the hipaa rules 
compliance with these final rules will be costly and could require complex changes in our systems 

table of contents transaction standards the standards for electronic transactions rule requires format standards for eight of the most common healthcare transactions  using technical standards issued by certain recognized standards publishing organizations 
healthcare providers  plans and clearinghouses transmitting or receiving any of these eight health transactions electronically must send and receive data using a common format  rather than the large number of different data formats currently used 
the initial compliance date for most entities was october   however  congress recently enacted a process allowing providers  payers and clearinghouses to file for an extension of one year 
the transaction standards are applicable to that portion of our business involving the processing of healthcare transactions among providers  payers and other healthcare industry participants 
the transaction standards apply to many of our customers and to our relationships with those customers 
we intend to comply with the transaction standards by the compliance dates  but our customers and business partners may elect to file extensions 
compliance may require costly modifications to some of our systems  products and services 
we believe that we are well positioned to make these changes and assist our customers and strategic partners with compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that we or our customers or strategic partners will be able to do so in a timely manner  or that we will be able to take advantage of any business opportunities or react to changes that may result from implementation of the transaction standards 
other state and federal statutes and regulations governing transmission of healthcare information may affect our operations 
for example  medicaid rules require some processing services and eligibility verification to be maintained as separate and distinct operations 
we carefully review our practices in an effort to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws 
these laws  though  are complex and changing  and the courts and other governmental authorities may take positions that are inconsistent with our practices thereby increasing our costs of complying or otherwise adversely affecting our operations 
privacy standards the standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information rule establishes a set of national privacy standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans  healthcare clearinghouses  healthcare providers and their business associates 
this rule governs the use and disclosure of such information  and establishes procedures for access to and amendment of information in designated record sets 
the compliance date for most entities is april  the privacy standards rule applies to the portions of our business that process healthcare transactions and provide technical services to other participants in the healthcare industry 
this rule provides for civil and criminal liability for violations  and requires us  our customers and our partners to use health information in a highly restricted manner  to establish policies and procedures to safeguard the information  and may require us to obtain individual authorizations and acknowledgements in some cases  and to provide certain access rights to individuals 
this rule may require us to incur significant costs to change our systems and services  and may restrict the manner in which we transmit and 
table of contents use the information 
in addition  our provider or payer customers may elect to transmit information directly without using a clearinghouse  or may restrict our access to information needed to support our information services business 
each of these events could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
numerous state and federal laws other than hipaa govern the collection  dissemination  use  access to and confidentiality of patient health information 
many states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality of medical records or medical information 
these state laws are not in all cases preempted by the hipaa privacy standard and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities  thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us  our customers and business partners 
regulations governing electronic health data transmissions are evolving rapidly and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
these other privacy laws at a state or federal level  or new interpretations of these laws  could create liability for us  could impose additional operational requirements on our business  could affect the manner in which we use and transmit information and could increase our cost of doing business 
in addition  determining whether data has been sufficiently de identified may require complex factual and statistical analyses 
the security rules promulgated pursuant to hipaa have been proposed but have not been finalized 
the purpose of the proposed security rules is to establish a minimum standard for the protection of individual health information that is stored or transmitted electronically 
the rules provide administrative procedures  physical safeguards  and technical mechanisms that may be implemented to satisfy the regulations 
when  and if  the proposed security regulations are finalized  they could result in significant financial obligations for us and will pose increased regulatory risk 
international data regulation other countries also have  or are developing  their own laws governing the collection  use  storage and dissemination of personal information or patient data 
these laws could create liability for our international operations  impose additional operations requirements or restrictions on our business  affect the manner in which we use or transmit data and increase our cost of doing business 

table of contents regulation of healthcare relationships federal and state laws govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships and inducements to beneficiaries of federal healthcare programs 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering  paying  soliciting or receiving anything of value  directly or indirectly  for the referral of patients covered by medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease  purchase or order of any item  good  facility or service covered by these programs 
the anti kickback law is broad and may apply to some of our activities or our relationships with our customers  or business partners 
penalties for violating the anti kickback law include imprisonment  fines and exclusion from participating  directly or indirectly  in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
many states have similar anti kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program 
we carefully review our practices in an effort to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws 
however  the laws in this area are both broad and vague and it is often difficult or impossible to determine precisely how the laws will be applied 
any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business 
in addition  federal and state agencies have been conducting investigations purportedly related to referral and billing practices of hospitals  laboratories and similar institutions 
although we currently monitor our arrangements with healthcare institutions to ensure compliance with prevailing industry practices and applicable law  we cannot guarantee that governmental investigators will not take positions that are inconsistent with our practices 
in order to remain competitive and satisfy the requirements and needs of our clients  we must remain informed of and adapt to new regulations governing the transmission  use and processing of personal information in electronic commerce and over the internet 
although many of these regulations may not apply directly to our business  we expect that these regulations and any new laws regulating the solicitation  collection or processing of personal or consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
our efforts to remain competitive and profitable and ensure compliance  and our customer s compliance  with these regulations may require the expenditure of significant sums in research and development and investments in new technology and processes and will require significant attention from senior management 
unanticipated changes in our accounting policies may be required because of mandates by standards setting organizations and could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in the process of managing our business and reporting financial results we rely on estimates and judgments made by management in the reporting and comparison of financial results 
these judgments are based on the standards in place at that time 

table of contents standards setting organizations are continuously reviewing the methodology and application of standards previously set and adjusting them as they deem appropriate 
in addition  new accounting standards may be formulated and released that could affect our reporting of actual results or outlook for anticipated future results 
if these revised or new standards cause us to restate financial results from prior accounting periods it could have a negative impact on our previously reported results 
similarly  if revised or new standards affect reporting of results in the current or future periods the comparison to prior results under the old accounting standards may not be favorable 
the investor is urged to use caution in this area in light of the current focus by regulatory agencies on accounting standards 
our profitability may suffer if we are unable to continue our expansion in new and existing markets 
our future growth and profitability depends  in part  upon our continued expansion within the healthcare electronic transaction processing and information services markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction processing and healthcare information services and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to expand into new and existing markets  we seek selective acquisition opportunities and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we cannot predict whether we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future  or whether any acquisition will provide us with the ability to expand into new markets 
expansion of the healthcare information services and electronic transaction processing markets is dependent upon the continued automation of traditional paper based processing systems and demand for new decision support applications 
our ability to penetrate these markets depends upon our ability to apply our existing technology  or to develop new technology  to meet the particular service needs of each new or expanded market 
we cannot guarantee that markets for our services will continue to expand and develop  that we will be successful in our efforts to meet the demands of these markets  or that we will have adequate financial  marketing and technological resources to penetrate new markets 
defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases of the company s products by large customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we have significant relationships with a limited number of large customers in our electronic processing and information services businesses that are achieving rapid growth 
as a result  our sales concentration has increased 
any defaults in payment or a material reduction in purchases from us by these large customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents recent and future combinations and strategic relationships may not be profitable 
we are currently devoting significant management resources and other resources toward the integration of our recent strategic combinations and relationships 
we have made substantial investments in healthtran  llc  a provider of pharmacy benefit administration  and in medunite  inc we recently acquired a majority interest in techrx incorporated  and we purchased the scriptline claim processing assets of arclight systems  llc 
entities in which we hold interests may  under certain conditions  require further investment by us 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our existing operations with these business partners 
even if integration occurs successfully  failure of these relationships to achieve levels of revenue growth  profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations  or otherwise not perform as expected  may adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
we may spend significant resources developing and promoting new products or solutions that may not be profitable 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or that our products and services will adequately meet the quickly changing demands of our customers 
in addition  in order to meet our customers demands  we are continually involved in a number of development projects  including our effort to update our core mainframe based products for the healthcare information services markets 
because we cannot predict the time and cost required in reaching certain research  development and engineering objectives  the costs of product development initiatives could significantly exceed our estimates  and project development schedules could require extensions 
in either of these events  our profitability and overall results of operations could be adversely affected 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our current product and service offerings and to continually develop and introduce new products and services that will keep pace with technological advances and satisfy evolving customer requirements 
further  we cannot ensure that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and services 
an inability to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner  or an unsuccessful new or updated product could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents proprietary technology protections may not be adequate and proprietary rights may infringe on rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and processes 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
although we believe that our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
additionally  we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets  to enforce our patent  copyright and trademark rights  and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation can be costly and time consuming 
litigation expenses or any damage payments resulting from adverse determinations of third party claims could be significant and result in material losses to us 
we may need additional capital to continue our growth and expansion 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including borrowings under a credit facility  if a credit facility is available  to finance acquisitions 
as a result  we may be subject to risks associated with debt financing  including increased interest rate expense  insufficient cash flow to meet required payments on our debt  inability to meet credit facility covenants  and inability to refinance or repay the debt as it comes due 
our anti takeover provisions may limit stockholder value 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  our stockholder protection rights agreement  and delaware law may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest 
a stockholder may not receive as much in exchange for his or her shares as they could without these provisions 
the following is a description of the provisions that may reduce the market prices for our shares of common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and our by laws separate our board of directors into three classes of directors  with each class as nearly equal in number as the total number of directors permits 
each class serves for three year terms  and each class term expires in different successive years 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more classes or series and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any action on the part of the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect 
table of contents of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our stockholder rights plan issues rights to our common stockholders  which entitle them to purchase preferred stock upon the happening of certain events 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors unless the offer contains certain conditions 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits certain persons from engaging in business combinations  which may also have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control 
if we lose the tax free status of the recent spinoff  you and ndc could be subject to substantial tax liability 
as part of our spinoff of global payments  inc  we received a tax ruling relating to the qualification of the distribution as a tax free distribution within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
the continuing validity of a tax ruling is subject to certain factual representations and assumptions 
if the distribution were to lose its status as a tax free distribution  we would recognize taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock distributed to our stockholders over our tax basis in the stock 
in addition  each ndchealth stockholder who received global payments  inc common stock in the distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock 
if the distribution is disqualified as tax free to ndchealth because of certain post distribution circumstances  such as an acquisition of global payments  inc within two years after the distribution that  together with the distribution  is treated as a single plan  we would recognize taxable gain but the distribution would generally remain tax free to each ndchealth stockholder 
under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement between us and global payments  inc  if the distribution fails to qualify as a tax free distribution because of an acquisition of their stock or assets  or some other action of theirs  then global payments  inc would be solely liable for any resulting corporate taxes 
however  if global payments  inc fails to indemnify us  we would be jointly and severally liable for federal income taxes resulting from the distribution being taxable
