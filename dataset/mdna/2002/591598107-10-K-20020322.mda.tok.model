item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  up from net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share in the increase in net income results from an increase in net interest income and other operating income partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses and other operating expenses 
these increases are largely attributable to the growth in average managed loans 
average managed loans increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion in  an increase of 
in addition  credit card charge volume was approximately billion for the full year  a increase over the same period in the provision for loan losses on a managed basis was billion in compared to billion in the increase relates to the estimated required balance in the allowance for loan losses to cover future charge offs inherent in our owned loan portfolio and an amount to reduce the contractual value of the retained interests in securitized loans to fair value as of december  higher credit card loan balances  increased net charge offs  increased delinquency rate and the current economic environment were factors considered by management in determining the necessary balance in the allowance for loan losses 
the managed net charge off rate was in compared to in the delinquency ratio was in compared to in excluding the ffiec guidelines on re aging accounts adopted january   which required us to report an additional million in receivables as delinquent as of december   the delinquency ratio was in other operating income on a managed basis increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to credit card fees  interchange fees and other credit card income  which increased to million in  up over million in enhancement services revenues increased to million in  up from million in these increases were primarily due to the growth in total credit card accounts  an increase in outstanding receivables in the managed credit card loan portfolio  development of new third party relationships and the creation of new products 
other operating expenses increased to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to continued investments in our infrastructure in order to service the growth in our managed credit card loan portfolio  an increase in overall marketing expenditures and increased amortization on purchased portfolio premiums 
our managed operating efficiency ratio decreased to in from in due to increased economies of scale and management cost saving initiatives begun in the latter part of on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires enterprises to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value 
prior to sfas  we amortized the costs of interest rate contracts on a straight line basis over the expected life of the contract 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a one time  non cash  after tax charge to earnings of million reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  during  million was recorded as a reduction to interest expense and a million gain was recognized as a result of recording derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at fair value and hedge ineffectiveness 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which replaces sfas  and revises the accounting standards and disclosure requirements for securitizations and transfers of financial assets and 
table of contents collateral 
it requires enterprises to recognize  upon transfer of financial assets  the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  derecognize financial assets when control has been surrendered  and derecognize liabilities when extinguished 
this statement is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities occurring after march  the recognition and reclassification of collateral and additional disclosures related to securitization transactions and collateral were effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
during the quarter ended march   we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  for our debt waiver products 
this sab formalized the accounting for services sold where the right to a full refund exists  requiring all companies to defer recognition of revenues until the cancellation period is complete 
previously  we recognized half of the revenues in the month billed and half in the following month 
we now recognize all of the revenue the month following completion of the cancellation period 
this change resulted in a one time  non cash net charge to earnings of million  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  because we have applied the provisions of this sab to our membership programs since  before the sec formalized its guidance  we did not have to adjust our enhancement services revenues 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are identified on pages through of this report  the most significant of which is our determination of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of retained interests and accounting for deferred origination costs 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses on our owned loan portfolio to cover management s estimate of the inherent losses as of the balance sheet date and an amount to reduce the contractual value of the retained interests in securitized loans to fair value 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider several factors  including historical charge off and recovery activity by age vintage of each loan portfolio noting any particular trends over recent periods  recent delinquency and collection trends by vintage  current economic conditions and the impact such conditions might have on borrowers ability to repay  the risk characteristics of the portfolios  overall payment trends  bankruptcy rates  and other factors 
these factors are reflected in financial projections prepared by the company to estimate future charge offs in the portfolio  which the company uses to support the amount of the allowance for loan losses as of the balance sheet date 
significant changes in these factors could impact our financial projections and thereby affect the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
retained interest we maintain an allowance for loan losses on our sold credit card receivables that effectively reduces our retained interests to fair value 
the company validates the fair value of the net retained interests by calculating the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimate of key assumptions including credit losses  net spreads  revolver rates and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
the 
table of contents significant assumptions used at year end for estimating the fair value of the retained interest in loans securitized are as follows at december  annual discount rate monthly payment rate weighted average spread annual principal and finance charge default rate includes finance charges  late fees and overlimit fees  less weighted average cost of funds and servicing fee 
at december   the sensitivity of the current fair value of the retained interests to immediate percent changes are as follows impact on fair value in millions of a increase or decrease annual discount rate monthly payment rate weighted average spread annual principal and finance charge default rate as the sensitivity indicates  the value of the company s retained interests on its balance sheet  as well as reported earnings  could differ significantly if different assumptions or conditions would prevail 
deferred acquisition costs we defer direct credit card origination costs associated with successful credit card solicitations that we incur in transactions with independent third parties  and certain other costs that we incur in connection with loan underwriting and the preparation and processing of loan documents 
these costs  which relate directly to membership solicitations direct response advertising costs  principally include postage  printing  mailings and telemarketing costs 
the total amount of deferred costs as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
the most significant assumption used by the company in determining the realizability of these deferred costs is future revenues from our credit cards and enhancement services products 
a significant reduction in revenues could have a material impact on the values of these balances 
deferred revenue on enhancement services products direct merchants bank offers various debt waiver products to its credit card customers 
revenue for such products is recognized in the month following completion of the cancellation period  and reserves are provided for pending claims based on direct merchants bank s historical experience with settlement of such claims 
unearned revenues and reserves for pending claims are recorded as deferred income and accrued expenses and other liabilities  respectively 
we record fees on membership programs as deferred income upon acceptance of membership and amortize them on a straight line basis over the membership period beginning after the contractual cancellation period is complete 
we defer and recognize extended service plan revenues and the incremental direct acquisition costs on a straight line basis over the life of the related extended service plan contracts beginning after the expiration of any manufacturers warranty coverage 

table of contents managed loan portfolio and the impact of credit card securitizations securitization a major source of our funding is the securitization of credit card loans 
for securitizations accounted for as sales under sfas  we are required to remove the related credit card loans from the consolidated balance sheet 
the securitization and sale of credit card loans changes our interest in the loans from lender to servicer  with a corresponding change in how we report revenues and expenses in our statements of income 
for securitized credit card loans accounted for as sales  amounts that we otherwise would have recorded as net interest income  fee income and provision for loan losses are instead reported in other operating income as net securitization and credit card servicing income 
for further analysis  see table impact of credit card securitizations accounted for as sales on page of this report 
managed loan portfolio we analyze our financial performance on a managed loan portfolio basis 
we do this by adjusting the income statement and balance sheet to reverse the effects of securitization 
our discussion of revenues  where applicable  and provision for loan losses include comparisons to amounts reported in our consolidated statements of income owned basis  as well as on a managed basis 
our managed loan portfolio is comprised of credit card loans  retained interests in loans securitized and the investors interests in securitized loans accounted for as sales 
the investors interests in securitized loans accounted for as sales are not assets of the company

net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 

table of contents net interest income net interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our credit card loans  less interest expense on borrowings to fund the loans 
table provides an analysis of interest income and expense  net interest spread  net interest margin and average balance sheet data for the years ended december   and managed net interest income for the year ended december  was billion  compared to billion in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to a billion increase in average managed loans over the comparable period in and an increase in net interest margins 
the net interest margin on managed interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in net interest margin is primarily due to lower average cost of funds 
cost of funds  primarily based on libor rates  decreased to in from in  partially offset by a decrease in portfolio yields to in from in because our credit card rates are based on the prime lending rate 
portfolio yields did not decrease at the same level as our cost of funds due to interest rate floors on some customer accounts as well as repricing initiatives taken early in due to the general deterioration in the economy and rising charge off rates 
the net interest margin on an owned basis decreased to for the year ended december   from in due to the fixed interest rates on direct merchants bank s certificates of deposit used to fund variable rate credit card loans in a decreasing interest rate environment 
risk based pricing we price credit card offers based on a prospect s risk profile prior to solicitation or upon receipt of a completed application 
we evaluate a prospect to determine credit needs  credit risk  and existing credit availability and then develop a customized offer that includes the most appropriate product  brand  pricing and credit line 
after customers open credit card accounts  we periodically monitor customers internal and external credit performance and periodically recalculate behavior  revenue  attrition and bankruptcy predictors 
we re evaluate customers risk profiles on a regular basis  and the lending relationship can evolve to include more competitive or more restrictive pricing and product configurations 
in our analyses  we consider the overall profitability of accounts  using both credit information and the profitability from selling enhancement services to customers

asset quality our delinquency and net loan charge off rates at any point in time reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of loans  the average age of our various credit card account portfolios  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
the average age of our credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates 
in order to minimize losses  we continue to focus our resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts  and on collections and post charge off recovery efforts 
at december   of our outstanding receivables balance was from accounts that have been with us in excess of two years  and of outstanding receivables were with us in excess of four years 
we use credit line analyses  account management and customer transaction authorization procedures to minimize loan losses 
our risk models determine initial credit lines at the time of solicitation 
we manage credit lines on an ongoing basis and adjust them based on customer usage and payment patterns 
to maximize profitability  we continually monitor customer accounts and initiate appropriate collection activities when an account is delinquent or overlimit 
delinquencies delinquencies not only have the potential to affect earnings in the form of net loan losses  but are also costly in terms of the personnel and other resources dedicated to their resolution 
we monitor delinquency levels on a managed basis  since delinquency on either an owned or managed basis subjects us to credit loss exposure 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified date on the cardholder s statement 
it is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card 
table of contents accounts  except in limited circumstances  until we charge off the account

net charge offs net charge offs are the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to make minimum payments  bankrupt cardholders and deceased cardholders less current period recoveries 
net charge offs exclude accrued finance charges and fees which are charged against the related income at the time of charge off 
during the quarter ended december  we changed our charge off policy to days from days for accounts that enter into a credit counseling or similar program and later become delinquent 
with the concurrence of regulatory authorities we concluded that these accounts should be treated as closed end loans and charged off after days under ffiec policy 
this change resulted in an additional write off of million in during the quarter ended march   we changed our policy for partially secured card accounts to charge off accounts that are days contractually delinquent rather than days 
this change was made based on our experience that secured card customers who are days delinquent more closely resemble recovery accounts

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses we make provisions for loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level estimated to be sufficient to absorb probable future loan losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the existing owned loan portfolio and an amount to reduce the contractual value of retained interests in loans securitized to fair value 
for securitized loans  anticipated losses and related provisions for loan losses are reflected in the calculations of net securitization and credit card servicing income 
the provision for loan losses on a managed basis for the year ended december   totaled billion compared to a provision of billion in of the billion and billion of provision for loan losses in and  million and million related to loans securitized  and million and million related to owned credit card loans and retained interests in loans securitized 
the increase in the managed provision for loan losses in compared to reflects the growth in credit card loans  an increase in delinquencies as a percentage of managed loans outstanding and the current economic environment 
the economy has slowed down significantly over the last year  exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  this changing environment has caused our delinquencies and losses to increase from prior years levels 
some of the actions we are taking to mitigate this slowdown include expanding our collections strategies to aggressively address any potential delinquency increases and utilizing our recovery staff to work on precharge off receivables 
we also leverage forbearance programs and credit counseling services for qualifying cardholders that are experiencing payment difficulties 
these programs include reduced interest rates  reduced or suspended fees and other incentives to induce the customer to continue making payments 
the amount of customer receivables in forbearance programs was million or of total managed loans as of december  compared with million or of managed loans as of december  the amount of receivables in forbearance programs decreased to million as of february  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end loans on a managed basis was at december  compared to at december  and at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of day plus receivables was at december  compared to at december  and at december  the reduction in the allowance as a percentage of loans and as a percentage of day plus receivables reflects a reduction in our partially secured credit card portfolio which experienced very high loss rates and related reserve requirements in  continued seasoning of our credit card portfolio  improved account collection strategies experience and performance of the master trust 
as of december   of our outstanding receivable balance had been with us over two years  and mature receivables are generally more predictable and more stable than new accounts  which allows us to forecast expected losses with a greater degree of accuracy 
furthermore  we continue to see improvements in early stage delinquencies due to tighter underwriting and better account analysis and management 
for purposes of assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserves  we segment our loan portfolio into several individual pools with similar credit risk and time since solicitation vintage pools and estimate based on historical experience and existing environmental conditions the amounts of loans that will not be collected and therefore charged off 
all new vintage pools are tracked separately until they are mature enough that their performance is consistent and steady enough to aggregate them into other vintage pools for analysis 
we continually evaluate these homogenous risk pools with a roll rate model that uses historical delinquency levels updated for current performance  loan seasoning and other measures of asset quality to estimate charge offs for both credit losses and bankruptcy losses 
additionally  in evaluating the adequacy of the loan loss reserves  we consider several subjective factors in determining the additional reserve and ultimate loan loss reserve necessary at each reporting period  including national and economic trends and business conditions  including the condition of various market segments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including those for underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery  and the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  
table of contents trends in volume and the product pricing of accounts  including any concentrations of credit  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses maintained at direct merchants bank essentially those loans not sold via securitization or third party conduit financing relationships 
such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
in determining the allowance for loan losses for credit card loans held by direct merchants bank  we have taken into consideration the office of the comptroller of the currency occ guidance for subprime lending programs 
under these guidelines  we are required to maintain an allowance for loan losses of at least twelve months future charge offs on all loans considered subprime primarily those loans with a fico score of or below or with damaged credit histories 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable future losses inherent in the loan portfolio under current conditions 
however  we cannot give assurance as to future credit losses that may be incurred in connection with our loan portfolio  nor can we provide assurance that the loan loss allowance that we have established will be sufficient to absorb future losses 
other operating income other operating income contributes substantially to our results of operations  representing and of owned revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other operating income increased million for the year ended december  over net securitization and credit card servicing income increased million to million in the increase was due to growth in the securitized loan portfolio and improved net interest rate spread offset by an increase in the provision for securitized loan losses

average owned receivables were billion in and billion in enhancement services revenues increased by million for the year ended december  this increase reflects higher credit protection revenue due to increased receivables and higher sales of our debt waiver products  as well as the increase in membership program revenues resulting from additional product offers to third party cardholders 

table of contents other operating expense total other operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million over  largely due to costs associated with the growth of our business activities 
employee compensation increased million for the year ended december   due to increased staffing needs 
credit card account and other product solicitation and marketing expenses increased million over  largely due to increased marketing efforts which resulted in million new credit card accounts and million new enhancement relationships during enhancement services claims expenses increased million primarily driven by increased debt waiver claims 
debt waiver claims expenses were million in and million in the million increase relates to increased balances covered by debt waiver 
as of december  we had a debt waiver total covered balance of billion  compared to billion as of december  purchased portfolio premium amortization increased million to million in compared to million in the increase relates to the amortization of premiums recognized on portfolio purchases late in and throughout between august  and october   we purchased three portfolios with a total receivables balance of million and a premium of million 
other expenses increased million for the year primarily due to increased rent and depreciation related to the necessary investments in facilities and equipment to support and improve our business 
derivative activities we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to interest rate risks 
we have a number of procedures in place to monitor and control both market and credit risk from these derivative activities 
our senior management approves all derivative strategies and transactions 
during and  we entered into interest rate cap and interest rate swap transactions 
we enter into interest rate caps through our subsidiary  metris receivables  inc mri on behalf of master trust investors 
interest rate caps are purchased on each of mri s securitized debt issuances 
we entered into interest rate swap transactions through direct merchants bank 
the swaps are used to effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate certificates of deposit cds to variable rate cds  and thus hedge the fair market value of the cds 
the cds expose us to variability in the fair value in rising or declining interest rate environments 
by converting the fixed payment to a variable payment  the interest rate swaps effectively reduce the variability of the fair market value of the cds 
we account for these contracts in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the change in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if the derivative qualifies as a hedge  the accounting treatment for the change in fair value varies based on the type of risk being hedged 
the monthly interest rate differential to be paid or received on these contracts is accrued and included in net securitization and credit card servicing income or deposit interest expense  as appropriate  on the consolidated statements of income 
interest payable or receivable under these contracts are classified under other receivables due from credit card securitization  net or other assets  as appropriate  on the consolidated balance sheets 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a one time  non cash  after tax charge to earnings of million reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  during  million was recorded as a reduction to interest expense and a million gain was recognized as a result of recording derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at fair value and hedge ineffectiveness

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our principal market risk is due to changes in interest rates 
this affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities  as well as indirectly  as interest rates may impact the payment performance of our cardholders 
to manage our direct risk to market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest rates and the interest sensitive components of our owned and managed balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
we seek to minimize that impact primarily by matching asset and liability repricings 
our primary managed assets are credit card loans  which are virtually all priced at rates indexed to the variable prime rate 
we fund credit card loans through a combination of cash flows from operations  asset securitizations  bank loans  subsidiary bank deposits  long term debt and equity issuances 
our securitized loans are owned by the master trust and bank sponsored single seller and multi seller receivables conduits  which have committed funding primarily indexed to variable commercial paper rates and the london interbank offered rate libor 
our million bank credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility that is indexed to prime rate and a million term loan that is indexed to libor 
the subsidiary bank deposits are issued at fixed interest rates 
the long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
at december   approximately of the master trust and conduit funding of securitized receivables was funded with fixed rate securities 
in an interest rate environment with rates at or below current rates  of the securitization funding for the managed loan portfolio is indexed to floating commercial paper and libor rates 
in an interest rate environment with rates significantly above current rates  the potentially negative impact on earnings of higher interest expense is partially mitigated by fixed rate funding and interest rate cap contracts 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis  which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on net income from an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates by basis points 
assuming that we take no counteractive measures  a basis point increase in interest rates affecting our floating rate financial instruments  including both debt obligations and loans  would result in an increase in net income of approximately million relative to a base case over the next months  while a decrease of basis points will result in a reduction in net income of approximately million 
you should not construe our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
in addition  this methodology does not take into account the indirect impact interest rates may have on the payment performance of our cardholders or the fact that libor and prime rates may not move in tandem in an increasing or decreasing rate environment 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions or other costs associated with managing immediate changes in interest rates 
liquidity  funding and capital resources one of our primary financial goals is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity through active management of assets and liabilities 
because the pricing and maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities change  liquidity management is a dynamic process  affected by changes in short and long term interest rates 
we use a variety of financing sources to manage liquidity  refunding  and interest rate risks

these events are described in the applicable prospectus of each securitization transaction 
the most significant events would be three consecutive months of less than zero percent excess spread or negative transferor s interest within the master trust
