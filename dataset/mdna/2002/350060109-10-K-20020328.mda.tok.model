the following table provides the backlog by business segment december  in thousands backlog rail products    construction products    tubular products    total backlog    the presentation has been restated to reflect the january  change in reporting segment of the buildings division  acquired in the cxt incorporated acquisition  from rail to construction products 
this change resulted in a backlog shift of million 
the reduction in rail segment backlog reflects the effect of cxt billings against long term production contracts 
total billings under these contracts were million in and million in critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are composed of product sales and products and services provided under long term contracts 
the company recognizes revenues upon shipment of material from stock inventory or upon billing of material shipped directly to the customer from a company vendor 
title passes to the customer upon shipment 
revenues from long term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon actual labor and engineering costs to estimated total labor and engineering costs 
for certain other products  the company recognizes revenues based upon the units delivered compared to total units ordered by the customer 
as certain long term contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company has historically made reasonable dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues  and contract costs on its long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue from contract change orders and claims is recognized when the settlement is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contract costs include all direct material  labor  subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
costs and estimated profits in excess of billings are classified as a current asset 
amounts billed in excess of costs and estimated profits are classified as a current liability 
asset impairment the company reviews long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  comprised primarily of acquired intellectual property  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is recognized when the projected net undiscounted future cash flows from an asset s use inclusive of any proceeds from disposition are less than the asset s carrying value and the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
at december   the company carried goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
for and earlier years  the company was required to evaluate whether goodwill and intangibles presented on the balance sheet were impaired based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the operating unit for which the assets related 
when factors indicate impairment of these assets  the excess unamortized asset  relative to the asset s estimated fair value  is immediately charged to operations 
the company continues to develop and test  in the market  products associated with the acquired intellectual property 
management believes that  upon market acceptance of these products  the carrying value of the intellectual property will be recovered 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
effective for fiscal years beginning after december   sfas provides the authoritative guidance for evaluating and recognizing impairment of goodwill 
in addition  in august  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas provides the prospective guidance for determining and recording impairments of the company s other long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets and intellectual property 
please refer to new accounting pronouncements for further discussion of these new rules 
inventories inventories are generally valued at the lower of the last in  first out lifo cost or market 
approximately in and in  of the company s inventory is valued at average cost or market  whichever is lower 
costs include direct material  direct labor  applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead  and other direct costs 
the reserve for slow moving inventory is reviewed and adjusted regularly  based upon product knowledge  physical inventory observation  and the age of the inventory 
provision for uncollectible accounts the company provides a reserve for uncollectible accounts through a combination of the aging of accounts and identified  specific account reviews 
the company has developed reserve factors based upon prior collection of aged accounts and applies those factors to the current aging to determine the company s reserve requirement 
the company s credit department may adjust these reserves  based upon a review of specific customer balances 
the provision is adjusted monthly to reflect changes in the company s receivable aging and current customer developments 
contingencies the company is subject to various domestic environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air  ground  and water  and may require the company to investigate and remediate the effects of the release and disposal of pollutants at sites associated with past and present operations 
the company accrues environmental remediation costs when the liability becomes probable and costs the company expects to incur become estimable 
environmental compliance costs  which principally include the disposal of waste by routine operations  are expensed as incurred 
capitalized environmental costs are depreciated  when appropriate  over their useful life 
reserves maintained for environmental matters were not significant at december  or  nor did the company incur significant environmental compliance or remediation costs for the three year period ended december  these reserves are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation progresses  any necessary adjustments to the reserves are recorded 
based upon currently available information  management does not believe that future environmental costs  in excess of those accrued  will have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
however  the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations for that period 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional future developments  administrative actions  or liabilities relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas and sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  these standards change the accounting for business combinations  goodwill  and intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations and clarifies the criteria for recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of sfas are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  with no maximum life 
in addition  sfas changes the test for goodwill impairment 
the new impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this step indicates impairment  then the loss is measured as the excess of the recorded value over its implied fair value 
the company will apply these new rules for accounting for goodwill and intangibles beginning in the first quarter of application of the non amortization provisions is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately million per year 
the company has yet to perform the transitional impairment test  and although management expects to record a charge in  the amount of that charge has not been quantified and any impact on the overall financial condition of the company  has yet to be determined 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
the obligations affected are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle as a result of existing or enacted law 
the company does not believe this standard will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company has not yet made a determination of the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements 
market risk and risk management policies the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate exposure on variable rate debt  primarily by using interest rate collars and variable interest rate swaps 
the company is not subject to significant exposures to change in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does  however  hedge the cash flows of operations of its canadian subsidiary 
the company manages its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on firm sales and purchase commitments by entering into foreign currency forward contracts 
the company s risk management objective is to reduce its exposure to the effects of changes in exchange rates on sales revenue over the duration of the transaction 
at december   the company did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
the company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
fluctuations in the fair values of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged items affect earnings 
to the extent that a change in an interest rate derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the interest rate being hedged  the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and required the transition adjustment from adoption to be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements
