item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the description of business  financial statements and the related notes of ade which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect ade s plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ade was founded in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitance and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
our products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the semiconductor wafer  device and data storage manufacturing processes 
we operate three major business segments  the semiconductor systems group ssg  ade phase shift pst and ade technologies ati 
the semiconductor systems group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on silicon wafer surfaces 
ade phase shift manufactures high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced interferometric technology that provides enhanced yield management to the data storage  semiconductor and optics industries 
ade technologies manufactures high precision magnetic characterization and non contact dimensional metrology gaging systems primarily for the data storage industry 
the company s markets are cyclical 
during fiscal year  the company experienced decreased demand for its products in all business segments as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the data storage industry 
consequently  the company experienced reduced order levels and revenues 
in response to the industry downturn  we have undertaken cost reduction measures  including headcount reductions  while maintaining our investment in research and development to position the company for the next wave of capital spending in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the data storage industry 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  accounting for incomes taxes and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company changed its revenue recognition policy effective may   based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our standard customer arrangement includes a signed purchase order  in which we offer payment terms of to days  no right of return of delivered products and a twelve month warranty 
we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  to days  we determine that the fee is not fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
for some of the company s sales transactions  a portion  usually  of the fee is not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
the other of the fee is normally due to days after shipment 
if the company has met defined customer acceptance experience levels with a specific type of product  these transactions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements with the deferral of the portion of the fee not due until installation is complete and customer acceptance has occurred 
management of the company must make a determination of what constitutes an appropriate experience level with a product 
this determination is based on  but not limited to  the extent to which a product contains significantly new technology  the number of similarly configured products previously delivered and our experience with a particular customer 
the portion of the fee related to the installation of the product and customer training is classified as service revenue 
all other sales with customer acceptance provisions are recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
the company s transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training are based upon the price charged when this element is sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
the amount allocated to system and parts is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to system revenue 
installation and training are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods in which the services are provided 
we do not provide the right to return products 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue from software consulting services provided on a time and reimbursable expense basis is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue from sales to japan ade ltd  our owned affiliate and a distributor of our products  by the ssg  ati and pst segments are reflected in segment revenue during the period they are shipped by the respective segment  which can differ from the period the revenue is recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on sales to japan ade ltd is recognized when the related product or software is shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  the company records a specific allowance based on the amount that the company believes will be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  the company will record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for the company s products  and technological obsolescence 
significant management judgments must be made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if our judgments and estimates relating to obsolete and excess inventory prove to be inadequate  our financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
accounting for income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of current year operating losses to date  anticipated additional operating losses for the third quarter of  an expected operating loss for fiscal  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance to reserve the remaining deferred tax assets  resulting in income tax expense of million 
the company currently has a full valuation allowance 
the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
had we not recorded this allowance  we would have reported materially different results 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of long lived assets intangible assets consist of capitalized license fees for software included in the company s products as well as goodwill obtained through the acquisition of the semiconductor solutions division of lpa software  inc ssd in september goodwill of  related to the acquisition of ssd is amortized on a straight line basis over ten years 
accumulated amortization on the goodwill at april  and was  and  respectively 
capitalized license fees of  for software included in the company s products is amortized at the greater of the ratio that current gross revenue for the related products bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue for those products or on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
accumulated amortization on the license fees at april  and was  and  respectively 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period significant decline in our technological value as compared to the market our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
to date  no such impairment has been indicated 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in ade s consolidated statements of operations 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative income loss from operations interest and other income  net net income loss fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal decreased sales of the company s products in the ssg segment reflected a decrease in demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor wafer and device industries as a result of the current severe down cycle 
revenue in the pst segment also decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of the current down cycle 
wafer and device manufacturers capital equipment purchases have been focused on advanced industry requirements rather than on capacity expansion  which resulted in technology purchases of the company s next generation of products in both the ssg and the pst segments 
the data storage industry has continued to experience extreme pricing pressure  consolidation and excess supply in many data storage market segments  which has resulted in reduced production and capital equipment purchases 
consequently  revenues from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue in fiscal was million higher than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue from sales to japan ade ltd 
that were recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but were recognized during fiscal on a segment basis 
the decrease in service revenues is consistent with the decrease in system and parts revenue and is reflective of the current down cycle in the wafer and device manufacturing industries 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the higher percentage of shipments of mm products in the ssg segment  which carry lower margins in their initial stages than the company s legacy products 
the company expects these lower margins to continue in the short term due to expected shipments of newer technologies 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit was a decline in factory utilization in all segments in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decrease in demand for the company s products 
gross profit from sales of services increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of overhead expense reductions during fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the sustained level of expense resulted primarily from continued investment by the ssg segment to develop its afs and awis products to capitalize on the next wave of worldwide capital spending  which is expected to be focused on mm wafer production 
also contributing to the overall level of expense was continued investment in research and development by the pst segment 
the company also continues to develop new products for the data storage industry  including those that measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the company is committed to continuing its investment in research and development to maintain its position as a technological leader  which may necessitate continued research and development spending at or above current levels 
the increase in expense as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the decrease in revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue at in both fiscal and fiscal the decreased expense in the all business segments resulted primarily from decreased commissions expense on sales made through both internal and external sales representatives 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
also contributing to the decrease in expense was a decrease in payroll expense and discretionary spending such as travel and advertising 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expenses increased primarily due to an increase in legal and patent expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in legal and patent expenses was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and lower discretionary spending during fiscal compared with fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income  net of interest expense  was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal interest and other income of million was mostly offset by interest expense of million associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and ssg manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts  the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ati in newton  massachusetts and the construction of the pst headquarters and manufacturing facility in tucson  arizona 
the interest rates on these bonds are fixed 
the decrease in interest and other income was due to both a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in invested cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consists of an increase of million in the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal the company has deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of current year operating losses to date  anticipated additional operating losses for the third quarter of  an expected operating loss for fiscal  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance to reserve the remaining deferred tax assets  resulting in income tax expense of million 
the company currently has a full valuation allowance 
as of april   the company has available unused operating loss carryforwards  which may be applied against future taxable income 
net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal and begin to expire in fiscal for state purposes and for federal purposes 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was partially offset by a  refund due to recent tax law changes 
the fiscal provision for income taxes consisted of state and foreign income taxes and federal income taxes  all of which represented alternative minimum taxes 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of our products in all segments of our business 
increased sales of the company s products were primarily due to an increase in demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor wafer and device industries while demand in the computer hard disk industry remained consistent compared with the prior year 
capital equipment utilization at wafer and device manufacturers has improved  resulting in some capital equipment purchases to adjust capacity on existing lines 
advanced industry requirements driven by shrinking device dimensions and larger silicon wafers have resulted in increased purchases of the company s next generation of products 
consolidated revenue in fiscal was million less than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue from sales to japan ade ltd 
that was not recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but was recognized during fiscal on a segment basis 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the gross profit resulted primarily from the effect of increased sales volume of shipments of legacy products and increased absorption of overhead expenses due to significantly increased manufacturing activity in the ssg segment 
in addition  our capacity utilization for the ssg segment improved during fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of efficiencies realized since the completion of the consolidation of the ssg manufacturing operations from charlotte  north carolina into the westwood  massachusetts facility in the latter half of fiscal gross profit at pst increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales volume  while gross profit at ati decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to product mix 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increase in expense resulted primarily from continued investment by the ssg segment to develop its afs and awis advanced wafer inspection systems to capitalize on the next wave of worldwide capital spending  which is expected to be focused on mm production 
also contributing to the increase in expense was continued investment by pst on its nanomapper wafer nanotopography system 
the overall increase in research and development expense was offset somewhat by a decrease in project materials expenses at ati 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the increase in revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal the company has continued its development efforts to enhance its existing mm and advanced mm wafer systems as its semiconductor industry customers seek to improve their yields on mm wafers as well as efforts to develop and enhance bridge tools  which can be used with either mm or mm wafers 
the company also continues to develop new products for the computer disk industry  including those  which measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the company is committed to continuing its investment in research and development to maintain its position as a technological leader  which may necessitate continued research and development spending at or above current levels 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increased expense resulted primarily from increased commissions expense on sales made through external sales representatives  primarily in asia  for the ssg segment due to increased sales volume during fiscal compared to fiscal also contributing to the increase in expense was an increase in payroll and benefits expenses in ssg in fiscal compared to fiscal expenses for pst and ati remained consistent with the prior year 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from in fiscal expenses decreased primarily as a result of decreased payroll and travel expenses savings related to the final consolidation of ssg s charlotte  north carolina operations into the westwood  massachusetts facility which was completed during the latter half of fiscal expenses at pst decreased due to a reallocation of benefits and expenses at ati were consistent with the prior year 
interest and other income 
interest and other income  net of interest expense  was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal interest and other income of million was partially offset by interest expense of million associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and ssg manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts  the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ati in newton  massachusetts and the construction of the pst headquarters and manufacturing facility in tucson  arizona 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  in compared to  in fiscal the fiscal provision for income taxes consisted of state and foreign income taxes and federal income taxes  all of which represent alternative minimum taxes 
there was no change in net deferred tax assets during fiscal selected consolidated quarterly operating results the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning may  and ending april  this information has been derived from ade s unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with ade s annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly 
our quarterly revenue typically is derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders may consist of multiple systems  each of which are priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of other factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and data storage industries product mix of our sales for the period the sales distribution channel of our sales for the period competitive pricing pressures our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis customer cancellations or rescheduled shipments production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components resulting in delayed shipments seasonal factors such as customers capital budget approval cycles 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
significant levels of our expenses are fixed in advance and based in part on our expectations as to future revenue 
as a consequence  any material shortfall in revenue in a given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our earnings

customers may cancel or reschedule shipments 
product shipments could be delayed by production difficulties or critical component inventory shortages 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as cost of revenue includes manufacturing overhead  which is relatively constant from quarter to quarter  gross margin can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to varying levels of production and revenue 
marketing and sales expenses can vary from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors  including mix of sales channels  geographic mix and the timing of marketing events 
there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in any future period 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
in addition  we had million in restricted cash used as security for a tax exempt industrial development bond issued through the massachusetts industrial finance agency in december we may substitute a letter of credit in an amount equal to approximately of the outstanding principal balance as collateral for our obligations under this bond  assuming we have the ability to borrow under a credit facility 
this substitution would allow the restricted cash balance to be used for general corporate purposes 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april  was million 
this amount resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for net non cash charges of million and a million net decrease in working capital accounts 
non cash items primarily consisted of million of depreciation and amortization and million from an increase in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
the net decrease in working capital of million was comprised of a decrease in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses of million  million and million  respectively  as well as decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred income on sales to japan ade ltd 
of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable resulted from the decreased billings and improved collections during fiscal the decrease in inventory resulted primarily from shipments of backlog from the end of the last fiscal year and from decreased inventory purchases related to the decrease in customer orders 
the decrease in prepaid expenses results primarily from the timing of payments and a decrease in prepaid commissions due to decreased sales levels 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from decreased purchases of inventory and the timing of payments to vendors 
the decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulted from decreases in deferred revenue and accrued warranty  which is related to decreased sales levels 
the decrease in deferred income on sales to japan ade ltd 
is due to the timing of shipments to jal and the acceptance of those shipments by jal s customers 
cash used in investing activities was million  and consisted of million for purchases of fixed assets  which was offset by a decrease in other assets of million and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
cash provided by financing activities was  and consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
this amount was partially offset by  in principal payments of long term debt 
we expect to meet our near term working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily through our available cash and cash equivalents  which will primarily be generated from sales to our customer base  both existing and new 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current customer base or acquire new customers

the company collateralized the issuance of this bond with a standby letter of credit from a financial institution 
the standby letter of credit  bearing a fee of of the outstanding bond balance  is collateralized by a mortgage on the building and land 
under the terms of the letter of credit  the company is required to comply with certain financial covenants 
as of april   the company is in compliance with these covenants 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will continue to be in compliance with such covenants or  if it were to not be in compliance  what the results would be 
for example  should cash and cash equivalents fall below a requisite level at any fiscal quarter end  a covenant would be violated 
the proceeds of the bond were used to fund the acquisition and renovation of the company s newton  massachusetts manufacturing facility 
the company collateralized the issuance of this bond with cash  which is classified as restricted cash on the april  and balance sheet 
the proceeds of the june bond were used to fund the acquisition and renovation of the manufacturing facility in the company s headquarters site in westwood  massachusetts

new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  and for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is after june  the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will thus be adopted by the company  as required  in fiscal year we believe the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our current financial position and results of operations 
as of may  the company will cease amortizing goodwill 
quarterly amortization for the year ended april  was approximately  in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will thus be adopted by the company  as required in fiscal year sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our current financial position and results of operations 
inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at april   the company s exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates on its investment portfolio 
the company s cash equivalents consist primarily of fixed income securities 
the company invests only with high credit quality issuers and does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a sharp increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the company s long term borrowings are at fixed interest rates 
in addition  a portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries and an affiliate 
the company generally transacts business in international markets in united states currency  but pays its employees in local currencies 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates
