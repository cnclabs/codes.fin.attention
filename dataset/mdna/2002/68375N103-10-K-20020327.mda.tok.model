our actual research and development and related activities may vary significantly from current plans depending on numerous factors  including changes in the costs of such activities from current estimates  the results of our research and development programs  the results of clinical studies  the timing of regulatory submissions  technological advances  determinations as to commercial potential and the status of competitive products 
the focus and direction of our operations will also be dependent upon the establishment of collaborative arrangements with other companies  the use of consultants  the availability of financing and other factors 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from research support agreements ratably over the length of the agreements 
we recognize revenue resulting from the achievement of milestones as the milestone is achieved 
amounts received in advance of services to be performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
