effects of newly issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of statement immediately  except with regard to business combinations initiated prior to july   which it expects to account for using the pooling of interests method  and statement effective january  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of statement statement will require upon adoption of statement  that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  statement will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
as of the date of adoption  the company will have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively

inflation inflation has not had  nor does the company anticipate it having  a significant impact on the company s current and future operations 
foreign currency the conversion of various european currencies to the euro has not had  nor does the company anticipate it having  a significant impact on the company s current and future operations 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as significant to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  beginning on page f intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price paid by the company over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method  is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated future period of benefit  which ranges from to years 
other intangible assets  including customer lists and covenants not to compete  are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement or the estimated future period of benefit  which ranges from to years 
the agreements pursuant to which the company acquired certain companies include provisions that could require the company to issue additional cash or shares of common stock if certain performance targets are met 
the value of any such additional consideration will be added to the goodwill related to such acquisition and amortized over the remainder of that goodwill s useful life 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
should the company experience a reduction in revenue and cash flow because our business or market conditions vary from our current expectations  we may not be able to realize the carrying value of these assets and will record an impairment charge at that time 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we considered all of the available evidence to arrive at our position on the net deferred tax assets  however  should circumstances change which would alter our judgment in this regard it may have an impact on future operating results
