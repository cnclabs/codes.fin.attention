item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company adopted a plan to divest an unprofitable peripheral operation that sells slatted steel coiling doors and related products for commercial users 
consequently  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in connection with the divestiture 
the divested unit  which was included in the garage doors segment  had net sales of million in  million in and million in operating losses of this unit were million in  million in and million in the segment results discussed below exclude the divested operation 
fiscal compared to fiscal operating results in thousands by business segment were as follows net sales operating profit garage doors     installation services     specialty plastic films     electronic information and communication systems     intersegment revenues   garage doors net sales of the garage doors segment increased by million compared to  principally due to higher unit sales of million driven by increased market share and improved service levels 
improved pricing of million also contributed to the sales increase 
operating profit of the garage doors segment increased million compared to last year 
gross margin percentage increased to  up from 
the increased margin was due primarily to lower raw material costs and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to  up from last year  with higher distribution and product development costs partly offsetting the gross margin increase 
in the latter part of  steel suppliers to the garage doors segment began to raise prices 
such increases did not have a significant effect on operating profit  while we cannot predict the amount and timing of future raw material price increases and any related selling price adjustments  it is anticipated that such changes will not have a material impact on operating results in installation services net sales of the installation services segment increased by million compared to last year 
the increase was principally due to the segment s expanded product offering  stronger new construction markets and increased market share

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in  up from last year due to costs associated with settled litigation and increased distribution and information technology costs 
this segment experienced upward pressure on raw material resin costs in the latter part of fiscal the segment is generally able to pass price increases on to certain customers 
although there could be some effect on future operating results due to the extent of raw material price increases and the timing and amount of resultant selling price adjustments  we do not expect such impact to be significant

we anticipate that revenues from such opportunities will commence in the latter part of fiscal and ramp up substantially in electronic information and communication systems net sales of the electronic information and communication systems segment increased million compared to sales growth in connection with defense communications and systems integration programs was partly offset by delays in anticipated awards  softness in international markets for radar products and by lower sales in the segment s integrated circuit business

accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that require management judgment and estimates and are most important in determining the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company recognizes revenues for most of its operations when title and the risks of ownership pass to its customers 
provisions for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to remit payments are recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
judgment is required to estimate the ultimate realization of receivables 
the company s electronic information and communication systems segment does a significant portion of its business under long term contracts with government agencies 
this unit generally recognizes contract related revenue and profit using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies primarily on estimates of total expected contract costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as contracts progress to completion 
contract cost estimates are generally updated quarterly 
revisions in revenue and profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the circumstances requiring the revision become known 
provisions are made currently for anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation requires the company to use judgment to estimate any necessary allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory  which estimates are based on assessments about future demands  market conditions and management actions 
recent accounting pronouncements effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill 
it eliminates the previous requirement to amortize goodwill and establishes new requirements with respect to evaluating goodwill for impairment 
with the assistance of a third party valuation expert  the company ascertained the fair value of its reporting units as part of adopting sfas and determined that goodwill of the installation services segment was impaired pursuant to the new standard 
the fair value of the installation services segment used in computing the impairment loss was determined through a combination of market based approaches and present value techniques 
results for fiscal include the related cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the amount of million net of an income tax benefit of million to reflect the impairment 
prior year operating results included goodwill amortization of approximately million 
the financial accounting standards board has also issued a number of other financial accounting standards which become effective in fiscal the company does not anticipate that adopting these pronouncements will have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition
