item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in june of  a new corporate strategic plan plan was announced 
the plan introduced an organization structured around three business units standard commercial lines  specialty commercial lines  and personal lines and established measurable financial targets for each business unit and the group 
during  certain operating results of the corporation improved 
the improvements were a result of renewal price increases  more favorable underwriting results and aggressive expense management 
the year also included the tragic events of september   which had an impact on results of operations net income the corporation reported after tax net income of million  or per share for the year  compared with a net loss of million  or per share in  and net income of million  or per share in operating results for the year  the corporation reported a net operating loss of million  or 
per share 
excluding a one time after tax charge of million  or 
per share  for the transfer of the renewal obligation of new jersey private passenger auto business  the after tax operating loss for the twelve months ending december   was million  or 
per share  compared with an operating loss of million  or per share in  and operating income of million  or 
per share in also contributing to the operating loss were the effects of additions to the group s asbestos reserves and the impact of an early retirement plan 
the operating loss included the adverse effects of write offs to the agent relationships intangible asset relating to the acquisition of the great american insurance company s gai commercial lines division  the impact of inadequate pricing and the negative effects of premium cessions on experience rated reinsurance contracts 
positively impacting results was the settlement of the california proposition liability 
in the fourth quarter of  a member of the group  ohio casualty of new jersey  inc ocnj  entered into an agreement to transfer its obligations to renew private passenger auto business in new jersey 
the transaction will allow the group to stop writing business in the new jersey private passenger auto market in early in recent years  the market in new jersey private passenger auto has become more unstable due to the inability to control either the volume of writings or the profitability 
under the terms of the transaction  the group member  ocnj  will pay million to a third party to transfer its renewal obligations 
the million amount was taken as a charge in the fourth quarter of and will be paid out over the course of twelve months beginning in early ocnj may also have a contingent liability of up to million to be paid to the transferee company to maintain a maximum premiums to surplus ratio of to operating income loss differs from net income by the exclusion of realized investment gains losses 
it is not intended as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
item continued on the transferred business during the next three years 
at december   it is not possible to determine the likelihood of the liability and  therefore  it has not been recognized in the financial statements 
the transaction is expected to positively impact operating results beginning in the results were also impacted by additions to the group s asbestos reserves and an early retirement charge 
during  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were strengthened by million after tax for asbestos related claims development 
also in  the corporation adopted an early retirement plan 
of the approximately employees eligible to retire under the program  accepted 
the early retirement plan resulted in a one time after tax charge of million for the year 
the events of september  had an impact on the results of operations for the year 
the group incurred before tax losses of million 
this loss has not reached any reinsurance limits for the group 
the million represents the group s best estimate of total losses  which could ultimately exceed the amount estimated 
based upon year end analysis of the financial strength of reinsurers  the group believes any potential future increases in this estimate covered under its reinsurance programs would be collectible 
in the first quarter of  the group made the decision to discontinue its relationship with all of its managing general agents 
the business written by the managing general agents was acquired in the purchase of the gai commercial lines division 
the result of the decision was a before tax write off of million to the agent relationships intangible asset  which was recorded on the balance sheet in connection with the gai purchase 
the asset was also written off in by million as a result of additional agent cancellations for a total write off of million for the year 
in  the corporation further wrote off the agent relationships asset by million as a result of additional agency cancellations and for certain agents determined to be impaired 
the impairment analysis is a critical accounting policy and was based on updated estimated future undiscounted cash flows that were insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset for the agent 
the determination of impairment involves the use of management estimates and assumptions 
due to the inherent uncertainties and judgments involved in making these assumptions  changes in the valuation of the agent relationship asset could again occur in the future if the underlying estimates change materially 
the operating loss was also impacted negatively by million before tax for ceded premiums on certain experience rated reinsurance contracts covering losses exceeding million 
the operating income was impacted by million before tax for similar premium cessions 
the premium cessions reflect changes in estimated loss experience  and have resulted in the maximum premium cessions under these contracts for business written through year investment results consolidated after tax realized investment gains losses amounted to million  or per share in  million  or 
per share in  and million  or per share in the realized gains included the effects of the group s partial reallocation of its equity portfolio to fixed income holdings 
significant appreciation in the equities  as part of the reallocation  contributed to the realized gains in the realized gains included a non recurring tax benefit of million related to the sale of a minority interest in stock of ocnj 
contributing to the realized investment gains were gains from a reallocation of the group s investment portfolio during the second quarter 
the corporation completed the reallocation by selling approximately million in equity securities  resulting in after tax realized gains of approximately million 
item continued the corporation s largest assets are its investments and  therefore  the related accounting policies are considered critical 
see further discussion of important investment accounting policies in note c 
the corporation reviews its investment portfolio quarterly to determine if any securities have sustained other than temporary decline in market value 
any loss on a security determined to be impaired is recognized as a realized loss in the current period 
the after tax realized gain loss was impacted by the write down of securities for other than temporary declines in market value by million in  million in and million in consolidated before tax investment income increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the increases in investment income can be attributed to the equity portfolio reallocations in and the reallocations in the investment portfolio reduced equity securities and increased investment grade securities 
also contributing to the increase in before tax investment income was the reallocation of investments from tax exempt municipal bonds to taxable bonds 
after tax investment income totaled million in  compared with million in and million in before tax and after tax investment income comparisons are impacted by investments in municipal bonds  which provide tax advantaged investment income 
reinsurance results the group has renewed all of its reinsurance programs for with only moderate changes in the program structure and pricing 
although the terrorist events of september  had a significant impact on the reinsurance market  the group s reinsurance contracts do include coverage for acts of terrorism 
instead of being unlimited as in the past  terrorism coverage in the contracts has been modified to exclude or limit coverage for certain upper layers of reinsurance 
the corporation believes that the terrorism coverage in its reinsurance programs is adequate to protect its financial health 
the pricing of reinsurance in increased only moderately from prior years due to the tragic events of september  and from other changes in the reinsurance market 
internally developed software in  the corporation introduced into limited production a new internally developed application for issuing and maintaining insurance policies 
the corporation capitalizes costs incurred to develop certain software used in the corporation s operations 
the cost associated with this application is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years from the date placed into service 
upon full implementation in  the new application should impact results by approximately to million per year in amortization expense until although management believes the asset represents its fair value  the useful life of the internally developed software was determined by using certain assumptions and estimates 
inherent changes in these assumptions could result in an immediate impairment to the asset and a corresponding charge to net income 
discontinued operations during  the corporation s life operations were discontinued 
in order to exit the life operations  the company executed an agreement in to reinsure the existing blocks of business through a coinsurance arrangement 
item continued on december   the company sold of the ohio life insurance company stock  thereby transferring all remaining assets and liabilities to the buyer 
the after tax gain on this sale totaled million  or 
per share 
net income from discontinued operations amounted to million  or 
per share in statutory results management uses statutory financial criteria to analyze the property and casualty results 
management analyzes statutory results through the use of insurance industry financial measures including statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  statutory underwriting expense ratio  statutory combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the statutory combined ratio is a commonly used gauge of underwriting performance measuring the percentages of premium dollars used to pay insurance losses and related expenses 
a discussion of the differences between statutory accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is included in note all lines discussion statutory net premiums written decreased million in to billion 
net premiums written totaled billion in and billion in the net premiums written decrease in and can be attributed primarily to a more selective underwriting philosophy that led to the elimination and cancellation of certain business 
actions taken in to cancel the managing general agents and the group s most unprofitable agents and policies represented over million in annual net premiums written 
the group s business is geographically concentrated in the mid west and mid atlantic regions 
the following table shows consolidated net premiums written for the group s five largest states all lines net premiums written distributed by top states new jersey ohio kentucky pennsylvania illinois new jersey is the group s largest state with of the total net premiums written during in recent years  new jersey s legislative and regulatory environments have become less favorable to the group 
the state requires insurance companies to accept all risks that meet underwriting guidelines for private passenger automobile 
in the fourth quarter of  ocnj entered into an agreement to transfer its new jersey private passenger auto renewal obligations to proformance insurance company 
this transaction will allow the group to stop writing business in the new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella markets in early new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella made up of the group s new jersey net premiums written in excluding the group s new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella net premiums written  new jersey would have represented of the total all lines net premiums written in the group expects to continue writing all of its other lines of business in the state 
item continued excluding the million  or point impact of the new jersey renewal obligation transfer fee  the statutory combined ratio improved points to in  compared with in and in the improvement in the statutory combined ratio in over was due to improvement in the standard commercial lines statutory loss ratio and all lines statutory underwriting expense ratio when excluding the million new jersey transfer fee 
the standard commercial lines statutory loss ratio improved to from in the statutory combined ratio was impacted adversely by increases in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios 
the loss ratio was impacted by adverse development in the workers compensation and general liability lines of business for and prior accident years 
the workers compensation line of business added points to the overall loss ratio 
the all lines statutory accident year combined ratio excluding the new jersey transfer fee was  points lower than the calendar year results 
the loss and loss adjustment expense lae ratio component of the all lines statutory accident year combined ratio measures losses and claims expenses arising from insured events during the year 
the loss and lae ratio component of the all lines statutory calendar year combined ratio includes loss and lae payments made during the current year and changes in the provision for future loss and lae payments 
the difference between the statutory accident year and calendar year combined ratios is concentrated in the workers compensation  homeowners and general liability lines of business 
at year end  the group reallocated its carried bulk reserves in anticipation of statement of statutory accounting principles no 
under statutory accounting codification  which requires that companies carry their best estimate of loss reserves for each line of business  while previous requirements focused on the overall reserves 
the reallocation did not affect the all lines calendar year statutory combined ratio and did not have a material impact on most lines of business other than workers compensation and general liability 
the reallocation added points to the workers compensation statutory combined ratio and reduced the general liability statutory combined ratio by points 
catastrophe losses in totaled million  compared with million in and million in the group was impacted by separate catastrophes in  compared with catastrophes in and in catastrophe losses added points to the statutory combined ratio in  compared with points in and points in the catastrophes included the losses from the events of september  the group incurred before tax losses of million related to the terrorist activities 
the catastrophes included tornadoes in the greater cincinnati and oklahoma city areas as well as damage from hurricane floyd 
the effects of catastrophes on the corporation s results cannot be accurately predicted 
as such  severe weather patterns  acts of war or terrorist activities could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s results  reinsurance pricing and availability of reinsurance 
catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  for each of the last three years were catastrophe losses before tax statutory combined dollar impact ratio impact million million million item continued statutory underwriting expenses  as a percentage of net premiums written  increased by 
points in to  compared with in and in the statutory underwriting expense ratio includes points from the million charge for the new jersey transfer 
excluding the new jersey transfer fee  the improvement in the statutory underwriting expense ratio was the result of actions to lower commissions  eliminate workers compensation policyholder dividends and decrease the employee count 
the actions to lower commissions to current market levels for selected product lines improved the underwriting expense ratio 
points 
the actions to eliminate workers compensation policyholders dividends on new and renewal business and changes in reserves for dividends of issued policies improved the underwriting ratio 
points 
the reduction in employee count during improved the underwriting ratio by 
points 
the employee count was  as of december   compared with  at december  and  at december  the statutory underwriting expenses also included 
million of software amortization related to the limited rollout of a new internally developed software application 
on a statutory accounting basis  the new application is being amortized over a five year period in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
for year  the group will continue the rollout of the new application and expects the impact to statutory expenses to be approximately million to million in amortization 
upon full implementation in  the new application amortization should impact the statutory expenses by approximately to million per year through the additional cost is expected to be offset in part by reduced labor costs related to policy processing 
segment discussion in june of  the corporation introduced an organizational structure around three business units standard commercial lines  specialty commercial lines  and personal lines 
the corporation also announced projected statutory combined ratios for the three business units 
standard commercial lines standard commercial lines statutory combined ratio for the year decreased points to from in the statutory combined ratio was 
the actual statutory combined ratio results were slightly better than the projected standard commercial lines statutory combined ratio of 
renewal price increases had a positive impact during the year 
the average renewal price increase was for the standard commercial lines direct premiums written  compared with a average renewal price increase in the workers compensation line of business in the standard commercial lines segment impacted the year s results 
although overall results improved in  continued deterioration in the workers compensation line of business in led to disappointing results for the line 
workers compensation statutory combined ratio decreased points in to  compared with and for and  respectively 
the statutory loss ratio was the main component driving the high statutory combined ratio 
the statutory loss ratio was when used in this report  renewal price increase means the average increase in premium for policies renewed by the group 
the average increase in premiums for each renewed policy is calculated by comparing the total expiring premium for the policy with the total renewal premium for the same policy 
renewal price increases include  among other things  the effects of rate increases and changes in the underlying insured exposures of the policy 
only policies issued by the group in the previous policy term with the same policy identification codes are included 
therefore  renewal price increases do not include changes in premiums for newly issued policies and business assumed through reinsurance agreements  including great american business not yet issued in the group s systems 
renewal price increases also do not reflect the cost of any reinsurance purchased on the policies issued 
item continued  compared with and in and  respectively 
deterioration in prior year losses due to an increase in claims severity contributed to the poor results 
the accident year loss ratio of was points lower than the calendar year loss ratio 
the poor results in the workers compensation line of business in added points to the all lines statutory loss ratio  when including the year end reserve reallocation mentioned in the all lines discussion section 
in response to the deterioration of results  the group took action in to begin non renewing its most unprofitable workers compensation policies 
this business has a loss ratio approximately points higher than the total workers compensation line of business and is referred to as unsupported workers compensation as it is the only product in the customer s account 
as mentioned in the operating results section  the group also took action to discontinue its relationship with managing general agents 
these managing general agents accounted for million in annual workers compensation premium 
these non renewals and cancellations contributed to a  or million  decrease in workers compensation net premiums written  and a  or million  decrease in workers compensation net premiums written 
the group was able to achieve average renewal price increases for the workers compensation business of and for and  respectively 
net premiums written for  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
commercial auto net premiums written increased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in the increase was driven by renewal price increases  averaging on the commercial auto line of business 
the commercial auto statutory combined ratio decreased to  from in and in the improvement in was largely due to better underwriting and risk selection and the effect of renewal price increases 
was hindered by increased severity combined with inadequate pricing 
commercial multi peril cmp  fire inland marine net premiums written were million in  compared with million in and million in the statutory combined ratio decreased to in from in and in the improvement in the line has been a result of implementing renewal price increases and more selective underwriting 
general liability net premiums written decreased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in the and decreases reflected the group s focus on fundamental underwriting strategies 
the general liability statutory combined ratio decreased points in to  compared with in and in while improvement in underwriting is being shown  the higher than desired loss ratios are attributable to adverse development on prior accident years 
the accident year statutory combined ratio for was 
the difference between the accident and calendar year results is primarily due to increases in asbestos reserves in for further development on existing claims outstanding 
item continued statutory combined ratios by business unit  including selected major lines of business standard commercial lines workers compensation auto commercial general liability cmp  fire inland marine specialty commercial lines commercial umbrella fidelity surety personal lines auto agency auto direct homeowners total all lines specialty commercial lines specialty commercial lines statutory combined ratio for the year was  compared with the projected statutory combined ratio of 
the statutory combined ratio was and for and  respectively

private passenger auto agency net premiums written decreased million  or to million in  compared with million in and million in selective underwriting and agency cancellations contributed to the decline in premiums in new jersey s private passenger auto net premiums written represented approximately of the item continued group s total private passenger auto book of business in new jersey regulation mandates private passenger automobile insurers in the state to provide insurance to all eligible consumers with limited exceptions 
this take all comers regulation eliminates the group s ability to control the volume and selection of writings in the state 
the statutory combined ratio was  excluding the fee related to the transfer of the new jersey personal auto book in  compared with in and in poor underwriting results in new jersey was the primary cause of the poor performance in the new jersey results added points to the private passenger auto agency statutory loss ratio 
new jersey results were driven by regulatory restraints in the state which restrict the insurers ability to raise rates 
in addition  the new jersey state senate passed an auto insurance reform bill effective in that mandated a rate reduction for personal auto policies 
this reform bill was based on legal reform intended to provide a reduction in medical expense benefits  limitations on lawsuits and enhanced fraud protection 
while the rate reduction was immediate  many of the reforms have not yet been implemented  resulting in inadequate rate levels for the group 
the state of new jersey also requires additional assessments to be paid by insurers and requires insurance companies to write a portion of their business in high risk areas 
new jersey requires assessments to be paid for the new jersey unsatisfied claim and judgement fund ucjf 
this assessment is based upon estimated future direct premiums written in that state 
the group paid assessments of million in  million in and million in since  new jersey has also required insurance companies to write a portion of their personal auto premiums in urban enterprise zones uez 
these zones are generally higher risk urban areas 
the group is required to write one policy in uez for every seven policies written outside uez 
the group is assigned premiums if it does not write the required quota 
in  the group wrote million in uez premiums  with million in additional assigned premiums in  compared with million in uez premiums and million in additional assigned premiums in in  the group wrote million in uez premiums  with million in additional assigned premiums in the loss ratios on uez premiums were  and for  and  respectively 
the loss ratios on the assigned business were  and for  and  respectively 
given the unfavorable regulatory environment in new jersey and the continued unprofitability of its private passenger auto business in the state  the group announced in the fourth quarter of the transaction to allow the group to stop writing business in early in the private passenger auto market in new jersey 
the transaction  described in the operating results section  is expected to positively impact private passenger auto results beginning in the group is implementing price increases in other states  claims management procedures and insurance scoring to improve results 
the group began to rollout insurance scoring in selected states in and expects this to help improve results by matching prices more closely with anticipated loss experience 
the group began direct marketing of personal auto coverage in january in  the corporation first restructured its private passenger auto direct operations with an internet only strategy  and later discontinued the private passenger auto direct line of business in the fourth quarter 
the line was discontinued in order to focus on the independent agency system as the distribution channel for the group 
as a result of the restructuring  net premiums written dropped from million in to million in the group wrote million of net premiums in statutory combined ratios were  and for  and  item continued respectively 
the underwriting expense ratio included million  or points  in expenses for fees for the removal of certain obligations related to assigned private passenger auto policies in new york 
although the group discontinued the private passenger auto direct line  the group remains committed to expanding its internet capabilities that focus on full service options for our agents and convenience options for our policyholders 
homeowners net premiums written fell in to million from million in and million in the group has placed emphasis on price increases  insurance scoring and agency management 
the company introduced an insurance to value program in which addressed underinsured homeowner properties and emphasized adequate replacement cost values 
the homeowners statutory combined ratio increased

the change in is due in part to payment received in as part of the commutation of a reinsurance treaty in the fourth quarter of and a refund of prior year taxes paid 
the cash used primarily resulted from lower operating results and taxes paid 
investing activities used net cash of million in  compared with net cash used of million in and net cash generated of million in total cash used for financing activities was million in  compared with million in and total cash used of million in cash used for financing decreased in was a result of the elimination of shareholder dividends 
cash used from financing decreased in from as a result of the reduction in shareholder dividends and the corporation s decision not to repurchase any of its shares 
overall  total cash generated in was million  compared with cash used of million in and cash used of million in the corporation did not pay any shareholder dividends in  compared with dividend payments of million in and million in the corporation did not pay shareholder dividends in as a result of the corporation s decision to further strengthen the corporation s financial position

although the corporation did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in or  the corporation did repurchase  shares for million in since the beginning of  million shares have been repurchased at an average cost of per share 
the corporation is dependent on dividend payments from its insurance subsidiaries in order to meet operating expenses  debt obligations  and to pay dividends 
insurance regulatory authorities impose various restrictions and prior approval requirements on the payment of dividends by insurance companies and holding companies 
as of december   approximately million of statutory surplus was not subject to restriction or prior dividend approval requirements 
the following table presents the corporation s obligations other than obligations relating to its ordinary insurance operations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable operating leases new jersey transfer fee total contractual cash obligations debt as of december   the corporation had million of outstanding notes payable 
of the million  million is a long term low interest loan with the state of ohio used in conjunction with the home office purchase 
the remaining million is a current note payable under a credit facility that provided a million revolving line of credit to the corporation 
on march   the corporation elected to reduce the aggregate amount available under the revolving line of credit from million to million 
the credit facility agreement contains financial covenants and provisions customary for such arrangements 
the most restrictive covenants include a maximum permissible consolidated funded debt that cannot exceed of consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the agreement and a minimum statutory surplus of million 
effective march   the covenant was amended to require a minimum statutory surplus of million for the quarters ending march  and june   returning to minimum statutory surplus of million for subsequent quarters 
the corporation continues to review its financial covenants in the credit agreement in light of its operating losses 
as of december   the corporation was in compliance with these covenants 
however  further deterioration of operating results  reductions in the equity portfolio valuation  or other changes in statutory surplus may lead to covenant violations which could ultimately result in default 
item continued the credit agreement expires in october  with any outstanding loan balance due at that time 
the corporation is evaluating its capital requirements and is exploring ways to refinance its debt and increase its financial flexibility 
the corporation has taken steps to strengthen its financial position by aggressively managing expenses and first reducing quarterly dividends to shareholders and later eliminating the current quarterly dividend in the first quarter of the corporation will be required to obtain additional external funding  either in the form of debt or equity  in order to repay the balance of its current notes payable  which comes due october while the corporation believes that it should be able to obtain such external funding  the ability to raise such funding cannot be assured nor can the cost of such funding be determined at this time 
rating agencies regularly the group s financial strength is reviewed by independent rating agencies 
these agencies may upgrade  downgrade  or affirm their previous ratings of the group 
on july   am best announced that its rating of the group of companies is now a excellent from a previously 
the rating action reflects the sharp deterioration in the group s earnings and the significant reduction in policyholders surplus over recent years 
am best stated the excellent rating was due to solid capitalization and strategic initiatives put in place by management to improve earnings 
am best has placed a silent outlook on the group s rating 
on may   standard poor s s p rating services downgraded the group s financial strength rating 
the group s s p rating moved from bbb to bbb

on may   moody s investors services affirmed the group s a rating based on new executive leadership  ongoing expense reduction and re underwriting initiatives  reduction or elimination of its shareholder dividends  and strength of its independent agency relationships 
moody s has revised the outlook for the group s rating from negative to stable 
statutory surplus statutory surplus  a traditional insurance industry measure of strength and underwriting capacity  was million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  on january   statutory surplus was reduced by million to million for the cumulative effect of adopting new required statutory accounting principles 
the surplus was further reduced by the million after tax charge associated with the new jersey private passenger auto transfer and a decrease in the market value of the equity investment portfolio 
statutory surplus increased in due to the sale of a minority interest in the stock of a subsidiary  which caused a non recurring tax benefit of million 
the decrease in the surplus was due primarily to poor underwriting results  dividend payments  and the statutory treatment of the final installment payment for the acquisition of the commercial lines division of gai 
the ratio of premiums written to statutory surplus is one of the measures used by insurance regulators to gauge the financial strength of an insurance company and indicates the ability of the group to grow by writing additional business 
at december   the group s premiums written to surplus ratio is to the ratio was to and to in and  respectively 
item continued the national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurers and life insurers 
the formula is intended to measure the adequacy of an insurer s capital given the asset structure and product mix of the company 
as of december   all insurance companies in the group  with the exception of ocnj  exceed the necessary capital 
the exception for ocnj is due to a temporary difference in the recognition of deferred taxes related to the million new jersey transfer fee 
in  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles guidance  which replaced the former accounting practices and procedures manual as the naic s primary guidance on statutory accounting 
the new policies provide guidance for areas where statutory accounting had been silent and changed former statutory accounting in some areas 
the group implemented the codification guidance effective january  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles adopted to conform to the codification guidance were reported as an adjustment to statutory policyholders surplus as of january  the cumulative effect of adopting codification reduced statutory policyholders surplus by million on january  reinsurance reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer  called a reinsurer  agrees to cover  under certain defined circumstances  a portion of the losses incurred by a primary insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the primary insurer 
the group purchases reinsurance to protect against large or catastrophic losses 
there are several programs that provide reinsurance coverage 
the group s property per risk program covers property losses in excess of million for a single insured  for a single event 
this property per risk program covers up to million in losses in excess of the million retention level for a single event 
the group s casualty per occurrence program covers liability losses 
workers compensation  umbrella and other casualty reinsurance cover losses up to million  million and million  respectively  in excess of the million retention level for a single insured event 
the property catastrophe reinsurance program protects the group against an accumulation of losses arising from one defined catastrophic occurrence or series of events 
this program provides million of coverage in excess of the group s million retention level 
in  a portion of the catastrophe program was renewed with a multi year placement as in previous years 
this provides continuity and maintains rates and each reinsurer s overall share of the program 
over the last years  two events triggered coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
losses and loss adjustment expenses from the oakland fires in totaled million and losses and loss adjustment expenses from hurricane andrew in totaled million 
both of these losses exceeded the prior retention amount of million  resulting in significant recoveries from reinsurers 
reinsurance limits are purchased to cover exposure to catastrophic events having the probability of occurring every years 
item continued gai has agreed to maintain reinsurance on the commercial lines business that the company acquired from gai and its affiliates in gai is obligated to reimburse the company if great american s reinsurers are unable to pay claims with respect to the acquired commercial lines business 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large base of reinsurers is utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
during the last three fiscal years  no reinsurer accounted for more than of total ceded premiums 
as a result of these controls  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the group s largest liabilities are reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the accounting policies related to the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are considered critical 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established for all incurred claims and are carried on an undiscounted basis before any credits for reinsurance recoverable 
the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves involves the use of certain assumptions and estimates 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may change with further developments 
these reserves amounted to billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  in recent years  asbestos and environmental liability claims have expanded greatly in the insurance industry 
historically  the group has written small commercial accounts and has not sold policies with significant manufacturing liability coverages 
within the manufacturing category  we have concentrated on the light manufacturers  which further limits exposure to environmental claims 
consequently  the group s asbestos and environmental liability exposure is substantially below the industry average 
estimated asbestos and environmental reserves are composed of case reserves  incurred but not reported reserves and reserves for loss adjustment expense 
for  and  respectively  those reserves were million  million and million 
asbestos reserves were million  million and million and environmental reserves were million  million and million for those respective years 
these loss estimates are based on currently available information 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and legislatures  there is substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate liability 
the group increased its asbestos reserves in for further development on existing claims outstanding 
construction defect claims filed under general liability insurance policies involve allegations of defective work on construction projects  such as condominiums  apartment complexes  housing developments  and office buildings 
these claims usually involve multiple parties and carriers 
item continued the loss estimates for these claims are based on currently available information 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and legislatures  there is substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate liability 
california legal proceedings proposition was passed in the state of california in in an attempt to legislate premium rates for that state 
the proposition required premium rate rollbacks for california policyholders while allowing for a fair return for insurance companies 
in  the administrative law judge issued a proposed ruling with a rollback liability of million plus interest 
the group established a contingent liability for the proposition rollback of million plus simple interest at from may  this brought the total reserve to million at september  on october   the group announced a settlement agreement for california proposition that was approved by the commissioner of insurance of the state of california

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the corporation is exposed to other risks such as credit  reinvestment and liquidity risk 
credit risk refers to the financial risk that an obligation will not be paid and a loss will result 
reinvestment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall causing interim cash flows to earn less than the original investment 
liquidity risk describes the ease with which an investment can be sold without substantially affecting the asset s price 
the sensitivity analysis below summarizes only the exposure to market risk 
the corporation strives to produce competitive returns by investing in a diverse portfolio of high quality companies 
all investments are held as available for sale  as defined by sfas no 
market risk the corporation has exposure to losses resulting from potential volatility in interest rates 
the corporation attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management  periodic reviews of asset and liability positions and through maintaining a laddered maturity structure with an intermediate duration 
estimates of cash flows and the impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to the corporation s investment portfolio are modeled semi annually and reviewed regularly 
equity price risk equity price risk can be separated into two elements 
the first  systematic risk  is the portion of a portfolio or individual security s price movement attributed to stock market movement as a whole 
the second element  nonsystematic risk  is the portion of price movement unique to the individual portfolio or security 
this risk can be further divided between characteristics of the industry and of the individual issuer 
the corporation attempts to manage nonsystematic risk by monitoring a portfolio that is diversified across industries 
the following tables illustrate the hypothetical effect of an increase in interest rates of basis points and a decrease in equity values at december   and  respectively 
the changes selected above reflect the corporation s view of shifts in rates and values that are quite possible over a one year period 
these rates should not be considered a prediction of future events by the corporation as interest rates may be much more volatile in the future 
this analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity prices on the corporation s income  cash flow or shareholders equity 
in addition  the analysis does not take into account any actions the corporation may take to reduce its exposure in response to market fluctuations

certain assumptions are inherent in the above analysis 
the corporation assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates and equity prices at december   and  and that the composition of its investment portfolio remains relatively constant 
also  the corporation assumes a change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across all financial instruments 
the adjusted market values are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling
