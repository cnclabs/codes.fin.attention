the terms we  our and us refer to the company or the company and the operating partnership together  as the text requires 
the discussion of our results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gross leasable area gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development  acquisition  expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy that may occur subsequent to the original opening date

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily due to changes in other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily due to higher interest rate costs and a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to  and million during  and  respectively  and reflects the acquisitions  expansions and dispositions of real estate during each year 
cash used in financing activities of  and in  and  respectively  has fluctuated consistently with the capital needed to fund the current development and acquisition activity and reflects increases in dividends paid during  and joint ventures effective august   we announced the formation of a joint venture with c 
randy warren jr  former senior vice president of leasing of the company 
the new entity  tanger warren development  llc tanger warren  was formed to identify  acquire and develop sites exclusively for us 
we agreed to be co managers of tanger warren  each with ownership interest in the joint venture and any entities formed with respect to a specific project 
as of december   our investment in tanger warren amounted to approximately  and the impact of this joint venture on our results of operations has been insignificant 
in september  we established a joint venture  twmb associates  llc twmb  with respect to our myrtle beach  south carolina project with rosen warren myrtle beach llc rosen warren 
we and rosen warren  each as owners  contributed million in cash for a total initial equity in twmb of million 
in september  twmb began construction on the first phase of a new  square foot tanger outlet center in myrtle beach  sc 
the first phase is projected to cost million and will consist of approximately  square feet and include over brand name outlet tenants 
currently  leases for over  square feet  or of the first phase are fully executed 
stores are tentatively expected to begin opening in july of we currently anticipate construction of a  square foot second  and final phase to cost million 
prior to beginning construction on the second phase  rosen warren and we each will be required to contribute an additional million in cash for a total equity contribution in phase two of twmb of million 
upon the opening of phase one of the myrtle beach property  we will receive on going asset management fees 
in conjunction with the beginning of construction  twmb closed on a construction loan in the amount of million with bank of america  na agent and southtrust bank  the proceeds of which will be used to develop the tanger outlet center in myrtle beach  sc 
as of december   the construction loan had a  balance 
all debt incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is secured by its property as well as joint and several guarantees by rosen warren and us 
we do not expect events to occur that would trigger the provisions of the guarantee because our properties have historically produced sufficient cash flow to meet the related debt service requirements 
either owner in twmb has the right to initiate the sale or purchase of the other party s interest no sooner than october  if such action is initiated  one owner would determine the fair market value purchase price of the joint venture and the other would determine whether they would take the role of seller or purchaser 
the owner who is to designate the fair market value purchase price would be determined by the toss of a coin 
if either rosen warren or we enacted this provision and depending on our role in the transaction as either seller or purchaser  we could potentially incur a cash outflow for the purchase of rosen warren s interest 
however  we do not expect this event to occur in the near future based on the positive expectations of developing and operating an outlet center in the myrtle beach area 
other developments we have an option to purchase the retail portion of a site at the bourne bridge rotary in cape cod  massachusetts 
obtaining appropriate approvals for the bourne project from the local authorities continues to be a challenge and consequently  we are reviewing the viability of maintaining an option on the property 
any developments or expansions that we  or a joint venture that we are involved in  have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive funds from operations 
in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties 
we may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in accretive funds from operations 
financing arrangements on february   we issued million of senior  unsecured notes  maturing on february  the net proceeds of million were used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the million notes which were due march  the net proceeds were also used to repay the million libor plus term loan due january with fleet national bank and bank of america 
the interest rate swap agreements associated with this loan were terminated at a cost of  which has been included in interest expense 
in addition  approximately  of unamortized costs were written off as an extraordinary item 
the remaining proceeds were used for general operating purposes 
on march   we entered into a five year collateralized loan with wells fargo bank for million at a variable rate of libor plus 
the proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under existing lines of credit 
additionally  on march   we extended the maturity date of our existing million term loan with wells fargo bank from july to march on may   we entered into an eight year collateralized loan with john hancock life insurance company for million at a fixed rate of 
the proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under existing lines of credit 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased at par approximately million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes that mature in october the purchases were funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit which do not mature until june additionally during the first quarter of  we have purchased at par or below  an additional million of the october notes bringing the total purchased to million 
at december   approximately of our outstanding debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the average interest rate  including loan cost amortization  on average debt outstanding for the year ended december  was 
we intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital  including public debt or equity  to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in our best interest and our shareholders interests 
during the second quarter of  we amended our shelf registration for the ability to issue up to million in debt and million in equity securities 
we may also consider the use of operational and developmental joint ventures  selling certain properties that do not meet our long term investment criteria as well as outparcels on existing properties to generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities 
we maintain unsecured  revolving lines of credit that provide for unsecured borrowings up to million at december  during  we extended the maturity of each of our three million lines to june  also during  we cancelled a million line of credit which reduced our borrowing ability from lines of credit from million to million 
based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or equity subject to market conditions  we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during we anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table details our contractual obligations and commercial commitments over the next five years and thereafter in thousands contractual obligations thereafter debt       operating leases       our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios  including debt service coverage and leverage  and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of funds from operations on a cumulative basis 
we have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants  however  should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default  the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt 
we operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the code 
a reit which distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
based on our taxable income to shareholders  we were required to distribute approximately  in order to maintain our reit status as described above 
we distributed approximately  to common shareholders during  significantly more than our required distributions 
if events were to occur that would cause our actual dividend to be reduced  we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our reit status 
the following table details our commercial commitments in thousands commercial commitments lines of credit  joint venture guarantee  we currently maintain three unsecured revolving credit facilities with major national banking institutions  totaling million 
as of december  amounts outstanding under these credit facilities totaled million 
all three credit facilities expire in june we are party to a joint and several guarantee with respect to the million construction loan obtained by twmb 
see joint ventures section above for further discussion of the guarantee 
related party transactions in may  demand notes receivable totaling million from stanley k 
tanger  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  were converted into two separate term notes of which million was due from stanley k 
tanger and  was due from steven b 
tanger  our president and chief operating officer 
the notes amortize evenly over five years with principal and interest at a rate of per annum due quarterly 
the balance of stanley k 
tanger s note at december   through accelerated payments  was  steven b 
tanger s note was paid in full during additionally in august  the board of directors amended the notes to adjust the interest rate from per annum to day libor plus 
we believe the amended interest rate is at arm s length based on our current unsecured  variable borrowing rate 
during the first quarter of  stanley k 
tanger made a quarterly payment of market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we negotiate long term fixed rate debt instruments and enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on our floating rate debt 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
in january  we entered into new interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million 
in order to fix the interest rate  we paid  as mentioned previously in the financing arrangements section  these agreements subsequently were terminated in february at a cost of  which has been included in interest expense 
in december  we entered into another interest rate swap agreement on notional amounts totaling million 
this agreement fixes the day libor index at through january at december   we would have had to pay  to terminate this agreement 
a decrease in the day libor index would increase this amount by approximately  the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates 
we do not intend to terminate our remaining interest rate swap agreement prior to its maturity 
this derivative is currently carried on our books as a liability  however if held until maturity  the value of the swap will be zero at that time 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total debt at december  was million while the recorded value was million  respectively 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
cost capitalization we capitalize fees and costs incurred to originate operating leases  including certain payroll  fringe benefits and other incremental direct costs  as deferred charges 
the amount of these costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to executing successful leases 
we amortize these costs to expense over the average minimum lease term 
we capitalize costs incurred for the construction and development of properties  including certain payroll  fringe benefits and direct and indirect project costs 
the amount of these costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets 
direct costs to acquire assets are capitalized once the acquisition becomes probable 
the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee is currently considering a proposal that would limit the amount of overhead costs companies capitalize to certain payroll or payroll related costs 
if this proposal is adopted  the amount of costs we capitalize will be less than would have been capitalized before the adoption of this proposal 
impairment of long lived assets rental property held and used is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such an event  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount  and if less  recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we believe that no material impairment existed at december  revenue recognition base rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants sales volume percentage rentals and reimbursement of the tenants share of advertising and promotion  common area maintenance  insurance and real estate tax expenses 
percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met 
expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized when the applicable space is released  or  otherwise are recognized over the remaining lease term 
business interruption insurance proceeds received are recognized as other income over the estimated period of interruption 
funds from operations we believe that for a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be considered along with net income as presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare one equity real estate investment trust reit with another on the basis of operating performance 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate 
we caution that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
below is a calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and as well as actual cash flow and other data for those respective periods in thousands funds from operations net income    adjusted for extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt minority interest   depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate    loss gain on sale or disposal of real estate   funds from operations before minority interest    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding    for the years ended december  and  includes and in gains on sales of outparcels of land 
assumes our preferred shares  share and unit options and partnership units of the operating partnership held by the minority interest are all converted to our common shares 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by fas and fas  collectively  fas 
upon adoption on january   we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of  net of minority interest of  in other comprehensive income loss 
at december  in accordance with the provisions of fas  our sole interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge and is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
at december   the fair value of the hedge is recorded as a liability of  in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the fasb also issued sfas nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets fas and fas  respectively on june  the provisions of fas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  fas is required to be adopted beginning january  we currently do not have any assets identified as either goodwill or intangible assets 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with retirement of long lived assets fas 
fas establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement costs 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the provisions of fas no 
will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which replaces sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
fas retains the requirements of fas to recognized an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and to measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
the provisions of fas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we will implement the provisions of fas on january  we believe fas will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
under both fas no 
and  real estate assets designated as held for sale are stated at their fair value less costs to sell 
we classify real estate as held for sale when our board of directors approves the sale of the assets and we have commenced an active program to sell the assets 
subsequent to this classification  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
under fas no 
 the operating results of real estate assets held for sale are included in continuing operations 
upon implementation of fas no 
in  the operating results of newly designated real estate assets held for sale will be included in discontinued operations in our results of operations 
we currently do not have any assets that are held for sale 
during  the american institute of certified public accountants accounting standards executive committee issued an exposure draft statement of position sop regarding the capitalization of costs associated with property  plant and equipment 
under the proposed sop  all property plant and equipment related costs would be expensed unless the costs are directly identifiable with specific projects and the proposal would limit the amount of overhead costs companies capitalize to certain payroll or payroll related costs 
if this proposal is adopted  the amount of costs we capitalize will be less than would have been capitalized before the adoption of this proposal 
the expected effective date of the final sop is expected in late or economic conditions and outlook the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
approximately of our lease portfolio is scheduled to expire during the next two years 
approximately  square feet of space is up for renewal during  of which is located in our dominant center in riverhead  ny  and approximately  square feet will come up for renewal in if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we renewed of the  square feet that came up for renewal in with the existing tenants at an average base rental rate of approximately higher than the expiring rate 
this compares with the renewal of of the  square feet that came up for renewal in with the existing tenants at an average base rental rate higher than the expiring rate 
we also re tenanted  square feet during at a increase in the average base rental rate 
this compares favorably with the  square feet that were released in at an average increase of 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
as of march   existing tenants have already renewed approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in in addition  we continue to attract and retain additional tenants 
our factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  we reduce our operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of our combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
as of december  and  our centers were occupied 
consistent with our long term strategy of re merchandising centers  we will continue to hold space off the market until an appropriate tenant is identified 
while we believe this strategy will add value to our centers in the long term  it may continue to reduce our average occupancy rates in the near term
