lending activities general 
the bank originates fixed rate and adjustable rate arm loans secured by one to four family residences 
the bank originates arm loans and short term loans primarily for retention in its portfolio in order to increase the percentage of loans in its portfolio with more frequent repricing or shorter maturities than fixed rate mortgage loans 
the bank has continued to originate fixed rate mortgage loans in response to customer demand 
the bank has generally sold one to four family loans with maturities of years or greater into the secondary market with servicing released 
on occasion  the bank has retained year fixed rate loans in its loan portfolio to maintain appropriate asset levels 
the bank s one to four family loans are primarily secured by homes located in its market area in south dakota and minnesota 
the bank also originates consumer  multi family residential and commercial real estate  construction  agricultural and commercial business loans in its primary market area 
the bank originates residential and non owner occupied construction loans that are presold to borrowers or held for sale by local builders and  on few occasions  makes land acquisition and development loans 
see the loan and lease portfolio composition tables immediately following this section for further detail 
one to four family residential mortgage lending 
residential loan originations of this type are generated by the bank s marketing efforts  its present customers  walk in customers and referrals from real estate brokers and builders 
the bank has focused its lending efforts primarily on the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences 
the bank currently makes and year fixed and adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to of the appraised value of the collateral property provided that private mortgage insurance is obtained in an amount sufficient to reduce the bank s exposure at or below the level 
the bank currently offers an arm loan which has a fixed rate for the initial to years and converts to a one year arm loan for the remainder of the life of the loan 
the bank also offers a one year arm loan with a rate below the bank s then current fixed rate loan for a comparable or year term loan 
these loans provide for an annual cap and a lifetime cap at a set percent over the fully indexed rate 
as a consequence of using caps  the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as is the bank s cost of funds 
in addition  the bank offers a year balloon loan which has a fixed rate for the first or years of the loan term 
at the end of the five or seven year period  the loan converts to a or year fixed rate loan at the then current market rate provided that the borrower qualifies at the new rate 
if the borrower fails to qualify at the new rate  the loan becomes payable in full 
these loans are underwritten to conform to secondary market standards 
the bank also offers fixed rate through year mortgage loans that conform to secondary market standards 
interest rates charged on these fixed rate loans are competitively priced on a daily basis according to market conditions 
residential loans generally do not include prepayment penalties 
the bank also originates fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans through the south dakota housing development authority sdhda program 
these loans generally have terms not to exceed years and are either insured by the federal housing administration fha  veteran s administration va or private mortgage insuror and must have no more than a loan to value ratio 
the bank receives an origination fee of of the loan amount from the borrower and a servicing fee generally from the sdhda for these services 
the bank is the largest servicer of loans for the sdhda 
at june   the bank serviced million of mortgage loans for the sdhda 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on loan servicing 
in underwriting one to four family residential real estate loans  home federal evaluates both the borrower s ability to make monthly payments and the value of the property securing the loan 
property securing real estate loans made by home federal is appraised by an appraiser pursuant to its appraisal policy 
home federal requires borrowers to obtain title  fire and casualty insurance in an amount not less than the amount of the loan 
real estate loans originated by the bank contain a due on sale clause allowing the bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the collateral property 
commercial business lending 
in order to serve the needs of the local business community and improve the interest rate sensitivity and yield of its assets  the bank originates commercial loans to local businesses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability and risk management 
home federal s commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security  including loans to finance accounts receivable  inventory and equipment and business expansion within the bank s market area 
generally  home federal s commercial business loans have been to borrowers in its primary lending areas 
the bank originates commercial business loans directly and through programs sponsored by the small business administration sba of which a portion of such loans are also guaranteed in part by the sba 
the bank generally originates commercial business loans for its portfolio and retains the servicing with respect to such loans 
in the future  home federal anticipates continued expansion and emphasis of its commercial business lending  subject to market conditions and the home owners loan act the hola restrictions 
interest rates on commercial business loans adjust or float with a designated national index plus a specified margin 
see regulation business activities for hola restrictions 
commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business 
as a result  the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself which  in turn  is likely to be dependent upon the general economic environment 
the bank s commercial business loans are sometimes  but not always  secured by business assets  such as accounts receivable  equipment and inventory 
however  the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
whenever possible  all of the bank s commercial business loans include personal guarantees 
in addition  on major loans  the loan officer will perform on site visits  obtain financial statements and perform a financial review of the loan 
multi family and commercial real estate lending 
the bank engages in multi family and commercial real estate lending primarily in south dakota and the adjoining mid western states 
these lending activities may include existing property or new construction development or purchased loans 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
if the cash flow from the project is reduced for example  if leases are not obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
in addition  loans secured by property outside of the company s immediate market area may contain a higher degree of risk due to the fact that the company may not be as familiar with market conditions where such property is located 
the company does not have a material concentration of multi family or commercial real estate loans outside of its immediate market area 
the bank presently originates adjustable rate  short term balloon payment  fixed rate multi family and commercial real estate loans 
the bank s multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolio is secured primarily by apartment buildings and  to a lesser extent  churches  motels  office buildings  strip shopping centers and nursing homes 
the terms of such loans are negotiated on a case by case basis 
commercial real estate loans generally have terms that do not exceed years 
the bank has a variety of rate adjustment features  call provisions and other terms in its multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolio 
generally  the loans are made in amounts up to of the appraised value of the collateral property and with debt service coverage ratios of or higher 
the debt service coverage is the ratio of net cash from operations before payment of debt service 
however  these percentages may vary depending on the type of security and the guarantor 
such loans provide for a negotiated margin over a designated index which is generally the one to five year treasury note rate 
the bank analyzes the financial condition of the borrower  the borrower s credit history  the borrower s prior record for producing sufficient income from similar loans  references and the reliability and predictability of the net income generated by the property securing the loan 
the bank generally requires personal guarantees of borrowers 
depending on the circumstances of the security of the loan or the relationship with the borrower  the bank may decide to sell participations in the loan 
the sale of participation interests in a loan are necessitated by the amount of the loan or the limitation of loans to one borrower 
see regulation business activities for a discussion of the loans to one borrower rule 
in return for servicing these loans for the participants  the bank generally receives a fee of to 
also  income is received at loan closing from loan fees and discount points 
appraisals on properties securing multi family and commercial real estate loans originated by the bank are performed by appraisers approved pursuant to the bank s appraisal policy 
the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea includes a provision that limits the bank s non residential real estate lending ie  commercial real estate lending  other than lending on certain multi family residences to no more than four times its total capital 
this maximum limitation  which at june  was million  has not materially limited the bank s lending practices 
see regulation regulatory capital requirements 
under firrea  the maximum amount which home federal may lend to any one borrower is of home federal s unimpaired capital and surplus or million at june  loans in an amount equal to an additional of unimpaired capital and surplus may be made to the same borrower if such loans are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
see regulation business activities for a discussion of the loans to one borrower rule 
construction and development lending 
the bank makes construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences as well as to builders and  to a lesser extent  developers for the construction of one to four family residences and condominiums and the development of one to four family lots in the bank s primary market area 
construction loans to individuals for their residences are structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase  which typically runs to months 
these construction loans have rates and terms which match the one to four family permanent loans offered by the bank 
residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential loans 
the bank also makes loans to developers for the purpose of developing one to four family lots 
these loans typically have terms of one year and carry floating interest rates based on a national designated index 
loan commitment and partial release fees are charged 
these loans generally provide for the payment of interest and loan fees from loan proceeds 
the principal balance of these loans is typically paid down as lots are sold 
at june   the bank had million of development loans included in its construction and development loan portfolio 
builder construction and development loans are obtained principally through continued business from developers and builders who have previously borrowed from the bank as well as broker referrals and direct solicitations of developers and builders 
the application process includes a submission to the bank of plans  specifications and costs of the project to be constructed or developed 
these items are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property 
loans are based on the lesser of current appraised value and or the cost of construction land plus building 
the bank makes loans for the construction of multi family residential properties 
such loans are generally made at adjustable rates which adjust periodically based on the appropriate treasury note maturity 
at june   all of the bank s construction loans were performing in accordance with their terms 
construction loans are generally originated with a maximum loan to value ratio of and land development loans are generally originated with a maximum loan to value ratio of  based upon an independent appraisal 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating development and construction costs and the market for the project upon completion  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project  the related loan to value ratios and the likelihood of ultimate success of the project 
construction and development loans to borrowers other than owner occupants also involve many of the same risks discussed above regarding multi family and commercial real estate loans and tend to be more sensitive to general economic conditions than many other types of loans 
prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan  the bank requires an appraisal of the property  or for larger projects  both an appraisal and a study of the feasibility of the proposed project 
the bank s construction loan policy provides for the inspection of properties by independent in house and outside inspectors at the commencement of construction and prior to disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan 
consumer lending 
management considers its consumer loan products to be an important component of its lending strategy 
specifically  consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity and carry higher rates of interest than do one to four family residential mortgage loans 
in addition  management believes that the offering of consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to its existing customer base  by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross marketing opportunities 
for these reasons  home federal has continued to focus on the origination of consumer loans 
home federal currently purchases automobile conditional sales contracts from selected dealers within its market area as well as originating automobile loans directly 
loans secured by second mortgages  together with loans secured by all prior liens  are limited to or less of the appraised value of the property securing the loan and generally have maximum terms that do not exceed to years 
the student loans originated by home federal are guaranteed as to principal and interest by the south dakota education assistance corporation 
upon the student nearing graduation  home federal sells such student loans with servicing rights released 
consumer loan terms vary according to the type of collateral  length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower 
home federal offers both open and closed end credit 
overdraft lending is extended through lines of credit that are tied to a checking account 
the credit lines generally bear interest at and are generally limited to no more than  loans secured by deposit accounts at the bank are currently originated for up to of the account balance although historically the bank has loaned up to of the account balance  with a hold placed on the account restricting the withdrawal of the account balance 
the interest rate on such loans is typically equal to above the contract rate 
the underwriting standards employed by the bank for consumer loans  including mobile home loans  include an application  a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts  and an assessment of the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets  such as mobile homes  automobiles or boats 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
agricultural loans 
in order to serve the needs of the local business community and improve the interest rate sensitivity and yield of its assets  the bank originates agricultural loans through its agricultural division 
the agricultural division offers loans to its customers such as operating loans which are used to fund operating expenses which typically have a one year term and are indexed to the national prime rate  term loans on machinery  equipment and breeding stock that may have a term up to years and require annual payments  agricultural farmland term loans which are used to fund land purchases or refinances  and specialized livestock loans to fund facilities and equipment for confinement enterprises  loans to fund ethanol plant development 
agriculture real estate loans typically will have personal guarantees  a first lien on the real estate  interest rates adjustable to the national prime rate or treasury note rates  and annual  quarterly or monthly payments 
operating and term loans are secured by farm chattels crops  livestock  machinery  etc 
the operating assets of the borrower 
the bank also originates agricultural loans directly and through programs sponsored by the farmers service agency fsa of which a portion of such loans are also guaranteed in part by the fsa 
loan customers are required to supply current financial statements  tax returns for the past to years  and cash flow projections which are updated on an annual basis 
in addition  on major loans  the loan officer will perform an annual farm visit  obtain financial statements and perform a financial review of the loan 
leasing activities general 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  mid america leasing  the bank originates commercial and municipal leases 
these products have a fixed interest rate for the duration of the lease with terms typically ranging from months 
the leases generally are financed with usually only the first or first and last months payments due at lease inception 
as a result of the financing and fixed interest rate the yield on leases is higher than similar type lending products 
leases are originated generally in an eight state area in the upper midwest but originations can and have expanded nationwide 
all leases are secured by the equipment leased  with personal guaranties normally obtained on commercial leases 
commercial leases 
in order to support the bank and its customers and to improve the yield of its assets  mid america leasing originates commercial leases to customers primarily in the upper midwest 
the bank offers three types of commercial leases capital  tax and terminal rental adjustment clause leases trac 
trac is for larger titled equipment only such as semi tractors and trailers 
leases may be structured with a contracted residual of as little as up to of the equipment cost 
leases encompass a wide variety of equipment for a variety of commercial uses 
the customer base tends to be small to medium sized businesses that view leasing as another financing option that augments their overall operation 
repayment terms tend to be monthly in nature 
as with commercial loans  commercial leases typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of their business 
as a result  the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial leases may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself 
the collateral securing the leases will generally depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
municipal leases 
the bank also originates leases to municipal entities such as cities  counties  and public schools 
the lessee must be a political subdivision of the state in order to qualify as a municipal lease 
because the interest income earned on this type of lease is exempt from federal income taxes  the rate offered to the municipality is usually substantially lower than a comparable commercial lease 
repayment terms generally tend to be on an annual or semi annual basis coinciding with the municipality s tax receipts 
residuals are for municipal leases 
repayment is based on the municipality s ability to levy and collect taxes 
assuming the municipality has a bond rating  that  along with audited financial statements  are the basis for the lease 
on larger leases  bond ratings will be reviewed annually as well as financial statements 
loan and lease portfolio composition

the following schedule illustrates the scheduled principal contractual repayments of the company s loan and lease portfolio from continuing operations at june  mortgages which have adjustable or renegotiable interest rates are shown as maturing at the contractual maturity date

includes demand loans  loans having no stated maturity and overdraft loans 
includes equipment finance leases 
the total amount of loans due after june  which have predetermined interest rates is million  while the total amount of loans due after such date which have floating or adjustable interest rates is million 
scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of loans is substantially less than their average contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give the bank the right to declare a conventional loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgages are substantially higher than current mortgage loan rates 
one to four family mortgage loans have prepaid significantly due to the effect of lower mortgage rates during the last year 
nonperforming assets and classified loans nonperforming assets 
see asset quality under management s discussion and analysis for discussion 
classified assets 
federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered by the ots to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention by management 
when the bank classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
the bank s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the association s regional director at the regional ots office  who may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
in connection with the filing of its periodic reports with the ots and in accordance with its classification of assets policy  the bank regularly reviews problem loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
on the basis of management s monthly review of its assets  at june   the bank had criticized million of its assets as special mention including certain loans discussed in this form k and the bank had classified million as substandard including certain loans discussed in this form k  and approximately million as doubtful

see application of critical accounting policies and asset quality under management s discussion and analysis for discussion 
investment activities home federal is required under ots regulation to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  the bank has maintained its liquid assets above the minimum requirements imposed by the ots regulations and at a level believed by management adequate to meet requirements of normal daily activities  repayment of maturing debt and potential deposit outflows 
as of june   the bank s liquidity ratio liquid assets as a percentage of net withdrawable savings deposits and current borrowings was 
see regulation liquidity 
federally chartered savings institutions have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  certain bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements and federal funds 
subject to various restrictions  federally chartered savings institutions may also invest their assets in commercial paper  investment grade corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly 
generally  the investment policy of the bank is to invest funds among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the bank s asset liability management policies  investment quality and marketability  liquidity needs and performance objectives

borrowings of the bank  presently all from the fhlb of des moines  may be used on a short term basis to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels  and may be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities 
the bank in recent years has not relied on outside borrowings other than fhlb borrowings 
the availability of funds from loan sales is influenced by general interest rates 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail of the company s borrowings 
deposits 
the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the bank s deposits consist of statement savings accounts  now and checking accounts  money market and certificate accounts ranging in terms from days to years 
the bank primarily solicits deposits from its market area 
the bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies  advertising  and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts offered by the bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
in recent years  the bank has become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
the bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset liability management and profitability objectives 
based on its experience  the bank believes that its statement savings  money market  now and checking accounts are stable sources of deposits 
however  the ability of the bank to attract and maintain certificates of deposit  and the rates paid on these deposits  has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions

borrowings 
although deposits are the bank s primary source of funds  the bank s policy has been to utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds or can be invested at a positive rate of return 
the bank s borrowings consist primarily of advances from the fhlb of des moines upon the security of its capital stock of the fhlb of des moines and certain pledgable loans  including but not limited to  its mortgage related loans  mortgage backed securities and us government and other agency securities

competition home federal faces strong competition  both in originating real estate  commercial and consumer loans and in attracting deposits 
competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial banks  credit unions and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the bank s market areas 
commercial banks and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending 
the bank competes for real estate and other loans principally on the basis of the quality of services it provides to borrowers  interest rates and loan fees it charges and the types of loans it originates 
the bank attracts the majority of its deposits through its retail banking offices  primarily from the communities in which those retail banking offices are located  therefore  competition for those deposits is principally from other commercial banks and credit unions located in the same communities 
the bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  and convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each 
according to information contained in reports prepared by the fdic  the bank is the fifth largest financial institution based on total deposits with approximately of the deposit market share in minnehaha county 
minnehaha county includes the south dakota cities of sioux falls  brandon  dell rapids  crooks and hartford 
in addition  on a limited basis  the bank also attracts out of market deposits nationally through its internet branch 
employees at june   the bank had a total of full time equivalent employees ftes including ftes of the bank s service corporations 
the bank s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group 
management considers its relations with its employees to be good 
regulation general 
the bank is a federally chartered thrift institution  the deposits of which are federally insured by the savings association insurance fund the saif of the fdic 
accordingly  the bank is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations  by its primary federal regulator  the office of thrift supervision ots 
the bank is a member of the fhlb of des moines and is subject to certain limited regulation by the federal reserve board 
as the unitary thrift holding company of the bank  the company also is subject to federal regulation and oversight by the ots 
the purpose of the regulation of the company and other holding companies is to protect subsidiary savings associations where deposits are federally insured 
certain of these regulatory requirements and restrictions are discussed below or elsewhere in this document 
the following discussion is intended to be a summary of the material statutes  regulations and policies applicable to savings associations and their holding companies  and it does not purport to be a comprehensive discussion of such statutes  regulations and policies 
regulation of federal savings associations 
the ots has extensive authority over the operations of federal savings associations  such as the bank 
pursuant to this authority  the bank is required to file periodic reports with the ots and is subject to periodic examinations primarily by the ots and to a lesser extent by the fdic 
the last examination of the bank by the ots concluded on february  examiners may require a federal savings association to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves 
in  the ots realigned its regional supervisory structure and apportioned supervisory responsibilities to other regions 
the company was previously located in the central region and has been reassigned to the western region 
regulatory differences between regions should not be significant 
assessments 
the ots has established a schedule for the assessment of fees upon all savings associations to fund the operations of the ots 
the general assessment  paid on a semiannual basis  is computed by totaling three components the size of the association on which the basic assessment is based  the association s supervisory condition  which would result in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings institution with a composite rating of  or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association s operations  which would result in an additional assessment based on a percentage of the basic assessment for any savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced for others loans aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
the bank s ots assessment standard assessment for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  enforcement 
under the federal deposit insurance act the fdi act  the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all institution affiliated parties  including any controlling stockholder or any stockholder  attorney  appraiser or accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or regulation or breach of fiduciary duty or certain other wrongful actions that causes or is likely to cause a more than a minimal loss or other significant adverse effect on an insured savings association 
civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions and range from  for each day during which violations of law  regulations  orders  and certain written agreements and conditions continue  up to million per day for such violations if the person obtained a substantial pecuniary gain as a result of such violation or knowingly or recklessly caused a substantial loss to the institution 
criminal penalties for certain financial institution crimes include fines of up to million and imprisonment for up to years 
in addition  regulators have substantial discretion to take enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with its regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to receivership  conservatorship  or the termination of deposit insurance 
under the fdi act  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association 
if action is not taken by the director of the ots  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
business activities 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act  as amended the hola  and the regulations of the ots thereunder 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  b a limit of of an association s capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  c a limit of of an association s assets on the aggregate amount of commercial and agricultural loans and leases with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  d a limit of of an association s assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  e a limit of of assets on non conforming loans loans in excess of the specific limitations of the hola  and f a limit of the greater of of assets or an association s capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property 
under the hola  savings associations are generally subject to the same limits on loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks 
generally  under these limits  a savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of the association s unimpaired capital and surplus 
additional amounts may be lent  not in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
such collateral is defined to include certain debt and equity securities and bullion  but generally does not include real estate 
at june   the bank s lending limit under this restriction was million 
home federal is in compliance with the loans to one borrower limitation and had no borrowers in excess of the loans to one borrower requirements at june safety and soundness standards 
pursuant to the fdi act  as amended by fdicia and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of the community development act  the ots and the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted  a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia  as amended 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal stockholder 
in addition  the ots adopted regulations that authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice by the ots that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
information sharing 
on october   the president signed into law the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of public law the usa patriot act of 
of the many goals of the usa patriot act of  the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering is of paramount importance 
section of the usa patriot act of furthers this goal by providing for the sharing of information between the government and financial institutions  and among financial institutions themselves 
as with many other provisions of the usa patriot act of  congress has charged the department of the treasury with developing regulations to implement these information sharing provisions 
section a of the usa patriot act of requires regulations encouraging cooperation between financial institutions and the federal government through the exchange of information regarding individuals  entities  and organizations engaged in or reasonably suspected of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
customer identification programs for banks 
the department of the treasury  through the financial crimes enforcement network fincen  together with the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  the board of governors of the federal reserve system board  the fdic  the ots and the national credit union administration ncua collectively  the agencies are jointly issuing a proposed regulation to implement section of the usa patriot act of section requires the secretary of the treasury secretary to jointly prescribe with each of the agencies  the securities and exchange commission sec  and the commodity futures trading commission cftc  a regulation that  at a minimum requires financial institutions to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person seeking to open an account  to the extent reasonable and practicable  maintain records of the information used to verify the person s identity  and determine whether the person appears on any lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by any governmental agency 
the proposed regulation applies to banks  savings associations and credit unions 
insurance of accounts and regulation by the fdic 
the bank is a member of the saif  which is administered by the fdic 
savings deposits are insured up to  per insured member as defined by law and regulation by the fdic and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by fdic insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any fdic insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the fdic 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations  after giving the ots an opportunity to take such action  and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  or is in an unsafe or unsound condition 
pursuant to fdicia  the fdic established a risk based assessment system for determining the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by insured depositary institutions 
under the assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of three capital categories based on the institution s financial information as of the quarter ending three months before the beginning of the assessment period 
the three capital categories consist of a well capitalized  b adequately capitalized or c undercapitalized 
the fdic also assigns an institution to one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation provided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds 
an institution s assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned 
under the regulation  there are nine assessment risk classifications ie  combinations of capital groups and supervisory subgroups to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessment rates currently range from of deposits for an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and financially sound  with no more than a few minor weaknesses to of deposits for an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and substantial supervisory concern 
the fdic is authorized to raise the assessment rates as necessary to maintain the required reserve ratio of 
as a result of the deposit insurance funds act of the act  both the bif and the saif currently satisfy the reserve ratio requirement at june  the act also provides that the fdic cannot assess regular insurance assessments for an insurance fund unless required to maintain or to achieve the designated reserve ratio of  except on those of its member institutions that are not classified as well capitalized or that have been found to have moderately severe or unsatisfactory financial  operational or compliance weaknesses 
the bank has not been so classified by the fdic or the ots 
in addition  the act expanded the assessment base for the payments on the bonds the fico bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation to include the deposits of both bif and saif insured institutions beginning january  both bif and saif insured deposits are assessed the same fico rates 
under the fdi act  insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the ots 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
the fdic has adopted regulations that generally prohibit payments to directors  officers and employees contingent upon termination of their affiliation with an fdic insured institution or its holding company ie  golden parachute payments if the payment is received after or in contemplation of  among other things  insolvency  or a determination that the institution or holding company is in troubled condition 
certain types of employee benefit plans are not subject to the prohibition 
the regulations would also generally prohibit certain indemnification payments for civil money penalties or other enforcement action 
regulatory capital requirements 
federally insured savings associations  such as the bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
the ots has established capital standards  including a tangible capital requirement  a leverage ratio or core capital requirement and a risk based capital requirement applicable to such savings associations 
these capital requirements must be generally as stringent as the comparable capital requirements for national banks 
the ots is also authorized to impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual associations on a case by case basis 
the capital regulations require tangible capital not less than of adjusted total assets as defined by regulation 
tangible capital generally includes common stockholders equity and retained earnings  and certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related earnings on withdrawable accounts and deposits that qualify as core capital 
in addition  all intangible assets  other than a limited amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights and other categories must be deducted from tangible capital 
at june   home federal had million of unamortized loan servicing rights  none of which were required to be deducted from tangible capital 
the ots regulations establish special capitalization requirements for savings associations that own subsidiaries 
under these regulations certain subsidiaries are consolidated for capital purposes and others are excluded from assets and capital 
in determining compliance with the capital requirements  all subsidiaries engaged solely in activities permissible for national banks or engaged in certain other activities solely as agent for its customers such as mortgage banking activities are includable subsidiaries that are consolidated for capital purposes in proportion to the association s level of ownership  including the assets of includable subsidiaries in which the association has a minority interest that is not consolidated for gaap purposes 
all subsidiaries of the bank are includable subsidiaries 
the capital standards also require core capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets as defined by regulation 
core capital generally consists of tangible capital plus certain intangible assets  and up to of other intangibles which meet certain separate salability and market valuation tests 
at june   the bank had million in intangible assets which were subject to these tests 
the amount of servicing rights includable as core capital is limited to of such capital 
at june   the bank had tier i core capital equal to million  or of adjusted total assets  which is million above the minimum leverage ratio requirement of as in effect on that date 
the ots risk based capital requirement requires savings associations to have total capital of at least of risk weighted assets 
total capital consists of core capital  as defined above  and supplementary capital 
supplementary capital consists of certain permanent and maturing capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital and general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the risk based requirement only to the extent of core capital up to of core capital 
at june   home federal had no capital instruments that qualified as supplementary capital and million of general loss reserves  which was not in excess of of risk weighted assets 
certain exclusions from capital and assets are required to be made for the purpose of calculating total capital  in addition to the adjustments required for calculating core capital 
such exclusions consist of equity investments as defined by regulation and that portion of land loans and nonresidential construction loans in excess of an loan to value ratio and reciprocal holdings of qualifying capital instruments 
home federal had no such exclusions from capital and assets at june  in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet items  will be multiplied by the appropriate risk weight based on the risks inherent in the type of assets 
the risk weights assigned by the ots for principal categories of assets are i for cash and securities issued by the us government or unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  ii for securities other than equity securities issued by us government sponsored agencies  high quality mortgage backed securities and mortgage backed securities issued by  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by  the fnma or the fhlmc except for those classes with residual characteristics or stripped mortgaged related securities  iii for prudently underwritten permanent one to four family first lien mortgage loans not more than days delinquent and having a loan to value ratio of not more than at origination unless insured to such ratio by an insurer approved by fnma or fhlmc  and iv for all other loans and investments  including consumer loans  commercial loans  repossessed and loans more than days past due and all other assets 
on june   the bank had total risk based capital of million including million in core capital and million in qualifying supplementary capital and risk weighted assets of million including million in converted off balance sheet assets  or total capital of of risk weighted assets 
this amount was million above the requirement in effect on that date 
the following table sets forth home federal s compliance with its capital requirements at june  amount percent of applicable assets dollars in thousands gaap capital tier i core capital required excess over requirement risk based capital required excess over requirement tier i core capital figures are determined as a percentage of total adjusted assets  risk based capital figures are determined as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
the bank s investment in its subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital 
includes qualifying supplementary capital of million 
under fdicia all the federal banking agencies  including the ots  must revise their risk based capital requirements to ensure that such requirements account for interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of non traditional activities  and that they reflect the actual performance of and expected loss on multi family loans 
prompt corrective action standards 
the ots and the fdic are authorized and  under certain circumstances  required to take certain actions against any association that fails to meet its capital requirements 
the ots is generally required to take action to restrict the activities of an undercapitalized association generally defined to be one with less than either a core ratio  a tier risked based capital ratio or an risk based capital ratio 
any such association must submit a capital restoration plan and until such plan is approved by the ots may not increase its assets  acquire another institution  establish a branch or engage in any new activities  and generally may not make capital distributions 
the ots is authorized to impose the additional restrictions  discussed below that are applicable to significantly undercapitalized associations 
as a condition to the approval of the capital restoration plan  any company controlling an undercapitalized association must agree that it will enter into a limited capital maintenance guarantee with respect to the institution s achievement of its capital requirements 
any savings association that fails to comply with its capital plan or is significantly undercapitalized ie  tier risk based or core capital ratios of less than or a risk based capital ratio of less than must be subject to one or more of the additional specified actions and operating restrictions mandated by fdicia 
these actions and restrictions include requiring the issuance of additional voting securities  limitations on asset growth  mandated asset reduction  changes in senior management  divestiture  merger or acquisition of the association  restrictions on executive compensation  and any other action the ots deems appropriate 
an association that becomes critically undercapitalized ie  a tangible capital ratio of or less is subject to further restrictions on its activities in addition to those applicable to significantly undercapitalized associations 
the fdic must restrict the activities of a critically undercapitalized association and  among other things  prohibit any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business or engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  without the approval of the fdic 
the ots must appoint a receiver or conservator with the concurrence of the fdic for a savings association  with certain limited exceptions  within days after it becomes critically undercapitalized 
any undercapitalized association is also subject to other possible enforcement actions by the ots or the fdic 
such actions could include a capital directive  a cease and desist order  civil money penalties  the establishment of restrictions on all aspects of the association s operations or the appointment of a receiver or conservator or a forced merger into another institution 
the grounds for appointment of a conservator or receiver include substantially insufficient capital and losses or likely losses that will deplete substantially all capital with no reasonable prospect for replenishment of capital without federal assistance 
if the ots determines that an association is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice it is authorized to reclassify a well capitalized association as an adequately capitalized association and if the association is adequately capitalized  to impose the restrictions applicable to an undercapitalized association 
the imposition by the ots or the fdic of any of these measures on the bank may have a substantial adverse effect on the bank s and the company s operations and profitability and the value of the company s common stock 
the company s shareholders do not have preemptive rights  and therefore  if the company is directed by the ots or the fdic to issue additional shares of common stock  such issuance may result in the dilution in the percentage of ownership of the company of those persons owning shares of the company s common stock 
limitations on dividends and other capital distributions 
ots regulations impose various restrictions or requirements on associations with respect to their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions of capital 
ots regulations prohibit an association from declaring or paying any dividends or from repurchasing any of its stock if  as a result  the regulatory capital of the association would be reduced below the amount required to be maintained for the liquidation account established in connection with its mutual to stock conversion 
the ots imposes various restrictions or requirements on the bank s ability to make capital distributions  including cash dividends 
a savings institution that is the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company must file an application or a notice with the ots at least days before making a capital distribution 
the bank must file an application for prior approval if the total amount of its capital distributions  including the proposed distribution  for the applicable calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the bank s net income for that year plus retained net income for the previous two years 
however  a savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  such as the bank  will continue to have to file a notice  unless the specific capital distribution requires an application 
the ots may disapprove of a notice or application if the bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
liquidity 
all savings associations  including home federal  are required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation 
for a discussion of what the bank includes in liquid assets  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
at june   the bank s overall liquid asset ratio was 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  the hola and the ots regulations permit federally chartered savings associations to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority to establish such branches is available a in states that expressly authorize branches of savings associations located in another state or b to an association that qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the internal revenue code of  which imposes qualification requirements similar to those for a qualified thrift lender under the hola 
see qtl test 
the authority for a federal savings association to establish an interstate branch network would facilitate a geographic diversification of the association s activities 
this authority under the hola and the ots regulations preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under the community reinvestment act the cra  as implemented by ots regulations  a savings association has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires the ots  in connection with its examination of a savings association  to assess the association s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such association 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the association received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination 
the cra regulations rate an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the rating system focuses on three tests a a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its assessment areas  b an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and c a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices 
the amended cra regulations also clarify how an institution s cra performance would be considered in the application process 
qualified thrift lender test 
all savings associations  including the bank  are required to meet a qualified thrift lender qtl test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations 
this test requires a savings association to have at least of its portfolio assets which consists of total assets less the sum of goodwill and other intangible assets  properties used to conduct the savings association s business and specified liquid assets not exceeding of total assets in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for out of every months on a rolling basis 
at june   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments  and thus met the test 
the bank has met the qtl test since its inception 
loans and mortgage backed securities secured by domestic residential housing  fhlb stock  credit card loans  educational loans and certain small business loans as well as certain obligations of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic  the fdic and certain other related entities may be included in qualifying thrift investments without limit 
fhlmc and fnma stock and certain other housing related and non residential real estate loans and investments  including loans to develop churches  nursing homes  hospitals and schools  and consumer loans and investments in subsidiaries engaged in housing related activities may also be included  in varying amounts  not to exceed of portfolio assets 
any savings association that fails to meet the qtl test must either convert to a national bank charter or operate under certain restrictions on its activities  unless it requalifies as a qtl and thereafter remains a qtl 
if any association that fails the qtl test is controlled by a holding company  then within one year after the failure  the holding company must register as a bank holding company and become subject to all restrictions on bank holding companies 
see holding company regulation 
transactions with affiliates 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by the ots regulations and by sections a and b of the federal reserve act the fra 
in general  an affiliate of the association is any company that controls the association or any other company that is controlled by a company that controls the association  excluding the association s subsidiaries other than those that are insured depository institutions 
the ots regulations prohibit a savings association a from lending to any of its affiliates that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bhc act and b from purchasing the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
section a limits the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to of the capital and surplus of the savings association and also limits the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to of the savings association s capital and surplus 
extensions of credit to affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in section a  and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited 
section b provides that certain transactions with affiliates  including loans and asset purchases  must be on terms and under circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the association as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
in the absence of comparable transactions  such transactions may only occur under terms and circumstances  including credit standards  that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to non affiliated companies 
the association s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the frb thereunder 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders a be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and b not exceed certain limitations on the amount of the association s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the association s board of directors 
certain transactions with directors  officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflict of interest regulations enforced by the ots 
these conflict of interest regulations and other statutes also impose restrictions on loans to such persons and their related interests 
among other things  such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those for loans to unaffiliated individuals 
real estate lending standards 
the ots and the other federal banking agencies adopted regulations to prescribe standards for extensions of credit that a are secured by real estate or b are made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements on real estate 
the ots regulations require each savings association to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the association and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities 
the standards also must be consistent with accompanying ots guidelines  which include loan to value ratios for the different types of real estate loans 
associations are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loan to value limitations so long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately 
the guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan to value standards are justified 
privacy regulations 
under ots regulations adopted pursuant to the gramm leach bliley act of glb act  the bank is required to adopt procedures to protect customers nonpublic personal information 
the new regulations generally require that the bank disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares a customer s nonpublic personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
in addition  the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt out of having it share their personal information with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes 
the bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place  which has been reviewed  for compliance with the regulations 
holding company regulation 
the company is a unitary thrift holding company subject to regulatory oversight by the ots 
as such  the company is registered with and files reports with the ots and is subject to regulation and examination by the ots 
under the glb act  any company which becomes a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to a charter application filed with the ots after may  is prohibited from engaging in non financial activities or affiliating with non financial companies 
all unitary savings and loan holding companies in existence prior to may   such as the company  are grandfathered under the glb act and may continue to operate as a unitary savings and loan holding company without any limitations in the types of business activities in which it can engage at the holding company level  provided the bank continues to satisfy the qtl test 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over the company and its non savings association subsidiaries which also permits the ots to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings association 
as a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company  the company generally is not subject to activity restrictions 
if the company acquires control of another savings association as a separate subsidiary  it would become a multiple savings and loan holding company  and the activities of the company and any of its subsidiaries other than the bank or any other saif insured savings association would become subject to such restrictions unless such other associations each qualify as a qtl and were acquired in a supervisory acquisition 
if the bank fails the qtl test  the company must obtain the approval of the ots prior to continuing after such failure  directly or through its other subsidiaries  any business activity other than those approved for multiple savings and loan holding companies or their subsidiaries 
in addition  within one year of such failure the company must register as  and will become subject to  the restrictions applicable to bank holding companies 
the activities authorized for a bank holding company are more limited than are the activities authorized for a unitary or multiple savings and loan holding company 
see qualified thrift lender test 
in addition  for grandfathered savings and loan holding companies  such as the company  the glb act also prohibits the sale of such entities to nonfinancial companies 
this prohibition is intended to restrict the transfer of grandfathered rights to other entities and  thereby  prevent evasion of the limitation on the creation of new unitary savings and loan holding companies 
federal securities law 
the stock of the company is registered with the securities and exchange commission sec under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the sec under the exchange act 
company stock held by persons who are affiliates generally officers  directors and principal stockholders of the company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions 
if the company meets specified current public information requirements  each affiliate of the company is able to sell in the public market  without registration  a limited number of shares in any three month period 
federal reserve system 

under the federal reserve board s frb regulations  the bank is required to maintain non interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts 
frb regulations generally require that a reserves of must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts of million or less  subject to adjustment by the frb  and b a reserve of million plus subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board between and must be maintained against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
the bank is in compliance with these reserve requirements 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  or a passthrough account as defined by the federal reserve board  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets to the extent that the requirement exceeds vault savings associations are authorized to borrow from the frb discount window  but frb regulations require associations to exhaust other reasonable alternative sources of funds  including fhlb borrowings  before borrowing from the frb 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb of des moines  which is one of regional fhlbs  that administers the home financing credit function of savings associations 
each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
it makes loans to members ie  advances in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the fhlb 
these policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the federal housing finance board 
all advances from the fhlb are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the fhlb 
in addition  all long term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing 
as a member  home federal is required to purchase and maintain stock in the fhlb of des moines 
at june   home federal had million in fhlb stock  which was in compliance with this requirement 
in past years  the bank has received substantial dividends on its fhlb stock 
over the past five fiscal years such dividend yields have averaged and were for fiscal year for the fiscal year ended june   dividends paid by the fhlb of des moines to home federal totaled approximately  which constitutes a  decrease in the amount of dividends received in fiscal this reduction is primarily due to a decrease in interest rates from the prior year 
under federal law  the fhlbs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings associations and to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects 
these contributions have affected adversely the level of fhlb dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future 
these contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of fhlb stock in the future 
a reduction in value of the bank s fhlb stock may result in a corresponding reduction in home federal s capital 
under the glb act  membership in the fhlb system is now voluntary for all federally chartered savings associations such as the bank 
gramm leach also replaces the existing redeemable stock structure of the fhlb system with a capital structure that requires each fhlb to meet a leverage limit and a risk based permanent capital requirement 
pursuant to the glb act  the new capital plan for the fhlb of des moines was approved on july  by the federal housing finance board  which may be implemented as early as july   with a deadline to implement the plan by january  sarbanes oxley act 
on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act implements a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures for public companies designed to promote honesty and transparency in corporate america and better protect investors from corporate wrongdoing 
the sarbanes oxley act s principal legislation includes the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  auditor independence provisions which restrict non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  additional corporate governance and responsibility measures  including the requirement that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer certify financial statements and the expansion of powers of audit committees  expanded disclosure requirements  including accelerated reporting of stock transactions by insiders  mandatory disclosure by analysts of potential conflicts of interest  and a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations 
we do not believe that the sarbanes oxley act will have a material adverse affect upon the company s operations in the near term
