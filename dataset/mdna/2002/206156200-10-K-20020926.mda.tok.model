overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell on a worldwide basis high quality  popularly priced  easy to use image capture products 
our products include digital image capture devices  mm and aps traditional and single use cameras and instant cameras 
we manufacture and assemble our products in the people s republic of china prc for sales to retailers under our brand names  on a premium and private label basis  and to original equipment manufacturers oem 
over the last several years  we have evolved from a manufacturer and distributor of cameras to a contract manufacturer of high quality image capture products with strong retail distribution 
we have improved the quality and capacity of our manufacturing operations to a world class standard and have acquired additional core technology  design and engineering expertise which has  in turn  enabled us to improve product performance and picture quality and to respond quickly to customer requirements 
we recently established and registered a wholly foreign owned enterprise wfoe  named concord camera shenzhen company limited concord shenzhen  pursuant to the law of the prc concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment 
the business license of concord shenzhen  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of concord hk  permits it to manufacture and sell a variety of cameras and camera components and will permit it to make sales both in the prc and internationally of the products it manufactures 
we expect that concord shenzhen will begin operations in the prc during fiscal we sell directly to our retail sales and distribution rsd customers on a worldwide basis through offices and or representatives in the united states  latin america and canada concord americas  offices in the united kingdom  france and germany concord europe  and offices in hong kong concord asia 
concord asia is involved in all oem sales as well as free on board fob hong kong sales to large retail customers in the americas  asia  and europe 
these divisions market our products under the brand names concord r  polaroid r  concord eyeq r  keystone r  le clic r  argus r  apex r  goldline r and fun shooter r 
as a contract manufacturer  we have also developed products with some of the world s largest and most successful film  camera  global communication and technology companies 
our relationships with our oem customers are handled by our in house sales and marketing personnel 
in fiscal  no single oem customer s purchases represented more than of our net total sales 
as a result of our strategy over the last several years  our sales mix has become more diversified 
sales to our rsd customers accounted for approximately of total net sales for fiscal compared to approximately of total net sales during fiscal and sales to our oem customers represented of total net sales in fiscal compared to of total net sales in fiscal the evolution of our oem and branded products into digital and other image capture devices has diversified our product base 
in fiscal  our second year of selling digital image capture devices  such products accounted for approximately of our total net sales 
net sales of single use cameras accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  compared to approximately in fiscal although single use camera sales represented a substantial portion of our total net sales in fiscal  in the future we anticipate this percentage to decrease as sales of digital image capture devices increase 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration from a vendor to a retailer  which addresses the operating statement classification of consideration between a vendor and a retailer  we have reclassified certain variable selling expenses including advertising allowances and other discounts and allowances from being reported as a selling expense to a reduction of net sales 
as a result of adopting eitf in the second quarter of fiscal and reclassifying certain variable selling expenses for all amounts presented  we are reporting lower net sales  lower gross margins and lower selling expenses for all fiscal years discussed 
approximately   and  of variable selling expenses  consisting principally of advertising and promotional allowances  were reclassified as a reduction of net sales  resulting in a corresponding reduction of gross profit and selling expenses  with no effect on net income  for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  our rsd and oem net sales were approximately  and  respectively 
for fiscal  our rsd net sales include fob hong kong sales of concord asia to its customers in the americas of approximately  and to its customers in europe of approximately  to the extent possible  we will attempt to continue obtaining additional business from our current customers  and to establish new oem and rsd relationships by positioning ourselves as an innovative designer  developer  manufacturer  and marketer of high quality  popularly priced image capture products 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our application of accounting policies affects these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts owed to us could be adversely affected 
inventory inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or there is a higher rate of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to increase our inventory allowances resulting from lower of cost or market value adjustments and our gross profit could be adversely affected 
deferred taxes the deferred tax valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary 
in determining the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
on the contrary  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was made 
such charge could have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes included in our results of operations 
sales returns a provision for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
if future returns are higher than we predicted based on the historical data  our net sales could be adversely affected 
variable stock based compensation accounting for repriced stock options as a result of an exchange offer for outstanding stock option grants that was consummated in the fall of  we are now required to apply variable stock based compensation accounting for these grants until the options are exercised  cancelled or expired 
for fiscal  we did not record any variable stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations because our closing common stock price on june  was below the new repriced stock options exercise price of 
because the determination of variable stock based compensation expense associated with the repriced stock options is significantly dependent upon our closing stock price at the end of each prospective reporting period  it is not possible to determine its future impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared to net sales for fiscal the decrease in net sales resulted principally from decreases in sales to oem customers partially offset by an increase in sales to new and existing rsd customers 
on a comparative basis  in fiscal the decrease in oem sales was attributed to the lack of sales of a certain digital product to a former customer  significantly lower sales of instant cameras  and decreases in sales of both digital and film based products 
the increase in rsd net sales was primarily due to increases in sales to leading retailers in the americas 
for fiscal  rsd customer net sales were approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared to fiscal for fiscal  oem net sales were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or as compared to fiscal net sales of concord asia for fiscal  excluding fob hong kong net sales to its customers in the americas and europe of approximately  were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared to fiscal the decrease was due to lower oem net sales 
net sales of concord americas for fiscal  including fob hong kong net sales to customers in the americas  were approximately  an increase of approximately  or as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the success of certain new marketing programs  increased penetration with existing customers  and the positive sell through of certain new products 
net sales of concord europe for fiscal  including fob hong kong net sales to customers in europe  were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or as compared to fiscal gross profit gross profit for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  or as compared to fiscal gross profit  expressed as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was attributable to i significantly lower net sales  ii a digital inventory provision of approximately  iii competitive price pressures and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and labor utilization  iv a provision of approximately  related to specific product inventory for polaroid corporation polaroid which filed for bankruptcy in october and v higher product development costs 
included in gross profit for fiscal was approximately  of inventory provisions and approximately  associated with a restructuring and cost containment program restructuring initiative that was initiated in june product development costs and percentages of net sales for fiscal and were approximately  and   respectively 
we first began selling digital products in fiscal our product mix  which historically consisted entirely of traditional and single use cameras  is anticipated to continue changing with the introduction of more digital products in the future 
digital products  as compared to traditional and single use cameras  sell at significantly higher unit prices but generate lower gross margins as a percentage of net sales 
however  digital products generate greater gross profit dollars per unit than traditional and single use cameras 
consequently  as digital products increase as a percentage of our sales mix  we expect to experience a lower overall gross profit margin percentage and higher revenue and gross profit dollars per unit sold 
in addition  as we manufacture more digital products  we increase the risk of gross profit fluctuations due to digital component availability and increased costs 
since component availability can fluctuate and is subject to possible procurement delays and other constraints  it could possibly limit net profit growth and might have a negative impact on net sales and gross margins 
digital camera products are also subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion and obsolescence to a greater extent than traditional camera products 
because of rapid technological changes  some of our digital camera products became obsolete and consequently we recorded a significant inventory provision related to digital inventory during fiscal operating expenses operating expenses  consisting of selling  general and administrative  recovery of operating expenses  net  terminated acquisition costs and interest expenses  decreased by approximately  or  to  for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal operating expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal were certain amounts aggregating  comprised of i a provision related to an accounts receivable of  associated with polaroid s bankruptcy filing  ii a net provision related to an accounts receivable of  associated with kmart corporation s bankruptcy filing in january  iii a charitable contribution that the company made for victims of the september  terrorist attack in the amount of  and iv a reversal in june of an accrual associated with the restructuring initiative of approximately  which resulted in a reduction of general and administrative expenses restructuring reversal 
the restructuring initiative was completed in june in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included an approximate  provision oem provision for doubtful accounts for an accounts receivable associated with a former oem customer 
also  as a result of the restructuring initiative  general and administrative expenses included approximately  restructuring charge of the approximate  restructuring charge that the company recorded in its fourth quarter of fiscal also  operating expenses for fiscal included expenses of approximately  incurred in connection with a proposed acquisition that was not consummated 
selling expenses decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a significant decline in net sales resulting in lower freight and certain other variable selling expenses  as well as a decrease in salaries  travel and entertainment and tradeshow expenses 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal in april  we uncovered a fraudulent scheme including check forgery by a former employee  which resulted in the embezzlement of approximately  over an eighteen month period ending in april  the preponderance of which occurred in fiscal to date  our ongoing investigation confirms that the former employee acted alone and the misappropriated funds have been identified 
we expect to recover the full amount of the embezzlement from a combination of insurance proceeds and assets secured and to be recovered from the individual 
accordingly  the recovery of approximately  net of an approximate  cash recovery resulting in a net receivable of  has been recorded as an accrued receivable and is included in prepaid and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of june  in addition  we have recorded under the caption recovery of operating expenses  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal  approximately  related to the recovery  which is net of approximately  of expenses related to the investigation and recovery efforts 
the entire amount of the recovery was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal due to the fact that it is impractical to determine the impact on fiscal quarterly periods 
the embezzled amounts related to the prior fiscal year were not significant 
terminated acquisition costs of approximately  in fiscal related to a proposed acquisition that was not consummated 
negotiations regarding this acquisition were terminated in september interest expense decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  for fiscal from approximately  for fiscal the lower interest expense in fiscal was attributable to the decreased use of short term borrowings and the repayment of certain capital leases 
other income  net other income  net was approximately  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other income  net primarily includes investment income  foreign exchange gains and losses  directors fees  and certain public relations costs 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower investment income offset by approximately  of income from an arbitration award 
income taxes since july  the annual tax rate of concord camera hk limited concord hk has been 
as a company engaged in processing activities in the prc  we currently do not pay taxes or import export duties in the prc  but there can be no assurance that we will not be required to pay such taxes or duties in the future 
hong kong is taxed separately from the prc 
as a company engaged in processing activities in the prc  we have never paid any income or turnover tax to the prc on account of those activities in the prc 
existing prc statutes can be construed as providing for a minimum of to income tax and a turnover tax on our processing activities  however  the prc has never attempted to enforce those statutes 
we have been advised that the prc s state tax bureau is reviewing the applicability of those statutes to processing activities of the type engaged in by us  but it has not yet announced any final decisions as to the taxability of those activities 
after consultation with our tax advisors  we do not believe that any tax exposure we may have on account of our processing operations in the prc will be material to our financial statements 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries approximated  as of june  it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings 
upon eventual remittance  no withholding taxes will be payable 
for us federal tax purposes  as of june   we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  of which approximately  was attributable to deductions associated with stock option exercises  that expire as follows  in   in   in   in  and the balance thereafter

as of june   and june   we evaluated our deferred tax assets 
as part of assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we evaluated whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of our deferred tax assets  will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets relates directly to our tax planning strategies and our ability to generate taxable income for us federal and state and hong kong tax purposes 
as of june  and june  based on all the available evidence  we determined that it is more likely than not that our domestic and hong kong net deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
consequently  we did not adjust the valuation allowance 
we also evaluated our european net deferred tax assets and determined that  and  were to be recorded as a valuation allowance as of june  and june   respectively 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our effective tax rates were   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rate will depend upon the mix between foreign and domestic taxable income and losses  and the statutory rates of the related tax jurisdictions

gross profit gross profit for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  or as compared to fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to i competitive price pressures and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and labor utilization  ii nonrecurring charges of approximately  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to inventory provisions and approximately  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the restructuring initiative  iii higher product development costs and iv revenues from the sale of digital products 
of the  inventory provision  approximately  related to certain specific product inventory that was intended for a former oem customer and approximately  resulted from inventory being written down to lower of cost or market value

the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher investment income resulting from the invested proceeds from our public equity offering consummated in the fall of income taxes as of july   after assessing the realizability of the domestic net deferred tax asset  we reversed the existing valuation allowance for the domestic net deferred tax asset

foreign currency transactions we operate on a worldwide basis and our results may be adversely or positively affected by fluctuations of various foreign currencies against the us dollar  specifically  the canadian dollar  the european euro  british pound sterling  prc renminbi  hong kong dollar and the japanese yen 
our foreign subsidiaries purchase their inventories in us dollars and the majority of their sales are in us dollars 
accordingly  the us dollar is the functional currency 
certain net sales to our customers and purchases of certain components and services are transacted in local currency including japanese yen  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the translation from the applicable currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period

liquidity and capital resources on january   the securities and exchange commission issued an interpretive release on disclosures related to liquidity and capital resources 
this release requires us to disclose factors that are likely to affect our liquidity trends 
we are not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than those factors summarized under the caption risk factors in this report 
we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
we are not engaged in hedging activities and had no forward exchange contracts outstanding at june  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating lease commitments  purchase commitments and other contractual obligations 
these transactions are recognized in the our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  and are more fully discussed below 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  anticipated cash flow from operations  and amounts available under our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources for our anticipated short term working capital and capital expenditure requirements as well as our anticipated long term working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future

cash provided by operations cash used in operations in fiscal was approximately  which compared favorably to cash used in operations of approximately  for fiscal and unfavorably to cash provided by operations of approximately  for fiscal the changes in cash provided by operating activities for the respective fiscal years were primarily attributable to changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities capital expenditures for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were approximately   and  respectively  and related primarily to expenditures on plant and equipment purchased for our manufacturing facility in the prc 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily the result of significantly lower expenditures on plant and equipment purchases for our manufacturing facility in the prc due to the decline in sales 
we anticipate capital expenditures will increase substantially over those in fiscal due to increased investments in plant and equipment at our manufacturing facility in the prc in anticipation for increased revenue  primarily from oem sales 
for fiscal  the increase in cash from investing activities related to the maturity of certain short term investments made in fiscal cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities in fiscal was approximately  this resulted from repayments of capital lease obligations partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options

see hong kong financing facilities for information about our financial guarantees 
hong kong financing facilities concord hk has various financing and revolving credit facilities in place providing an aggregate of approximately  in borrowing capacity 
certain of the revolving credit facilities are denominated in hong kong dollars 
since the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the united states dollar

the exchange offer expired on october  options to purchase  shares of common stock were tendered in the exchange offer and accepted by us and cancelled and new options to purchase  shares of common stock were issued in exchange for the cancelled options 
as a result of the exchange offer  we are now required to apply variable accounting to these stock option grants until the options are exercised  cancelled or expire 
for fiscal  we did not record any variable stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations because our closing common stock price on june  was below the exercise price of 
because the determination of variable accounting expense associated with the repriced stock options is dependent  in part  on our closing stock price at the end of each prospective reporting period  it is not possible to determine its future impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on our financial statements 
common stock buy back programs in fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for approximately  as part of a board of directors approved common stock buy back program 
in february  we adopted an additional share repurchase program pursuant to which the board of directors allocated up to  for the repurchase of shares of our common stock

license agreement on august   our company announced it entered into two trademark licensing agreements  with the entity that purchased the assets of polaroid in an asset purchase transaction approved by the us bankruptcy court supervising the polaroid reorganization 
the two license agreements provide the company with the exclusive  worldwide use of the polaroid brand trademark in connection with the manufacture  distribution  promotion and sale of single use cameras and traditional film based cameras  including zoom cameras  and certain related accessories 
the licenses do not include instant or digital cameras 
each license includes an initial term of three and a half years and may be renewed  at our option  for an additional three year period 
each license agreement includes provisions for the payment of  of minimum royalties  which will be fully credited against percentage royalties 
in august  we paid a total of  which represented  for each license agreement  as partial payment of the minimum royalties 
growth opportunities we are evaluating various growth opportunities that could require significant funding commitments 
we have from time to time held  and will continue to hold  discussions and negotiations with i companies that represent potential acquisition or investment opportunities  ii potential strategic and financial investors who have expressed an interest in making an investment in or acquiring us  iii potential joint venture partners looking toward formation of strategic alliances that would broaden our product base or enable us to enter new lines of business and iv potential new and existing oem customers where the design  development and production of new products  including certain new technologies  would enable us to expand our existing business  and enter new markets including new ventures focusing on wireless connectivity and other new communication technologies 
we recently engaged an investment bank to help us attempt to identify suitable acquisition targets 
however  there can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be reached regarding any of the foregoing  nor does management believe that such agreements are necessary for the successful implementation of our strategic plans 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks regarding our company 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report 
most of our operations are subject to control by the people s republic of china prc and several of its local governmental agencies 
the continuing viability of our prc agreements is crucial to our business operations in the prc 
we manufacture a majority of the components used in our cameras and assemble all of our manufactured finished products in the prc 
our agreements with various prc government or quasi government agencies currently provide us with approximately  workers 
we are responsible for their wages  food and housing and must comply with a variety of local labor and employee benefit laws covering these workers 
while we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws as currently enforced  these laws are subject to modification and interpretation by the applicable governmental authorities 
we cannot predict the impact of any future modifications to or strict enforcement of the existing laws 
in addition  the termination or material modification of any of our agreements with the prc government and quasi government agencies could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
political and economic uncertainties in the prc could affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected by the imposition in the prc of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation  which could result in the inadequate development or maintenance of infrastructure  the unavailability of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  raw material and parts  or a deterioration of the general political  economic or social environment in the prc 
relocation time and expenses could result in substantial losses 
if we determine it is necessary to relocate our manufacturing facilities from the prc  due to confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  embargoes  or other governmental restrictions  we would incur substantial operating and capital losses including losses resulting from business interruption and delays in production 
in addition  as a result of a relocation of our manufacturing equipment and other assets  we would likely incur relatively higher manufacturing costs  which could reduce sales and decrease the current margin on the products we previously manufactured in the prc 
relocation of our manufacturing operations would also result in disruption in the delivery of our products  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products in the future 
there is also a risk of business interruption as a result of political events  the costs of which may exceed our insurance coverage 
the prc has experienced political disruptions in the past 
we maintain political risk insurance up to million on equipment and business interruption insurance up to million  but it is possible that political events may cause an interruption of our manufacturing operations  the cost of which might exceed our insurance coverage 
we are dependent on certain large customers 
in fiscal  we had two customers walgreens and wal mart each of whose purchases represented in excess of of our total net sales and whose purchases in the aggregate represented over of our total net sales 
the loss of any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with sales to our customers 
in fiscal  two of our customers  polaroid and kmart  filed for protection from their creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  during fiscal we recognized provisions related to polaroid accounts receivable and inventory and kmart accounts receivable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
polaroid s purchases represented approximately and kmart s purchases represented less than  respectively  of our total fiscal net sales 
the reversal of the international trade commission ban on importation of re loaded single use cameras could adversely affect our business 
in june  the international trade commission itc banned the unlicensed importation into the united states of new and reloaded single use cameras due to the infringement of such imports on existing patents held by fuji 
the court of appeals for the federal circuit the federal circuit recently upheld the ban on new single use cameras and reversed the itc s ban on reloaded single use cameras which were originally sold in the united states by fuji or its licensees and reloaded in a prescribed manner 
the federal circuit s decision opens the united states market to competition from non fuji licensees for single use cameras originally sold in the united states by fuji or its licensees and reloaded either in the united states or abroad in the prescribed manner 
the federal circuit s decision could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
we are dependent on a small group of key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
in particular  we rely on the continued services of ira b 
lampert  our chairman  chief executive officer and president 
the loss of this or any other key employee could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we believe our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be able to hire the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy  or we may need to pay higher compensation for employees than currently budgeted 
our inability to attract and retain such personnel could limit our growth and affect our profits 
our digital camera products involve a more complex development process  which we may not be able to successfully integrate into our operations 
digital cameras involve a more complex development process and component procurement process than our traditional and single use cameras 
manufacturing delays  including component procurement delays or shortages and the timely introduction and delivery of new components  which may be outside our control  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion and obsolescence 
digital camera products are subject to rapid technological changes  price erosion and obsolescence to a greater extent than traditional camera products 
because of rapid technological changes  some of our digital camera products became obsolete and  consequently  we recorded significant inventory provisions related to digital inventory during fiscal to be successful in the development  manufacture and sale of digital camera products  we have to react quickly to technological advances and manage our inventory effectively to accommodate price competition and the short life span of such products 
to achieve our operating and financial objectives  we must manage our anticipated growth effectively 
we anticipate that our business will grow 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to manage our anticipated growth 
to manage this growth  we will need to hire additional experienced  skilled personnel and to train  manage and retain key employees 
these activities may strain our management resources 
if we were unable to manage growth effectively  our profits would be adversely affected 
the camera and photographic products industry is highly competitive 
as a manufacturer and distributor of low cost  popularly priced image capture products  we encounter substantial competition from a number of firms  many of which have longer operating histories  more established markets  more extensive facilities and  in some cases  greater resources 
we are exposed to risks associated with intellectual property used in image capture devices 
image capture devices use technology which may be protected by unknown united states or foreign patents 
the right to use such intellectual property is subject to the availability of suitable license conditions from the patent holders which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
a claim of infringement by such a patent holder could be time consuming and costly to defend 
a lawsuit alleging patent infringement was filed by the massachusetts institute of technology and electronics for imaging  inc in april against defendants  including the company

we face certain foreign currency risks as a result of conducting a substantial portion of our business activities in hong kong 
since the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the united states dollar  but the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar may fluctuate in the future 
although our oem and major retail business is conducted in us dollars  certain of our obligations under agreements in the prc and with our hong kong suppliers are paid in hong kong dollars 
we are also exposed to currency risks in japan and other countries where we purchase materials for our products or sell those products 
we generally do not engage in currency hedging activities 
we also face political risks as a result of conducting administrative  sales  engineering and design activities in hong kong and the prc 
in july  the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong was transferred from the united kingdom to the prc and hong kong became a special administrative region of the prc 
we cannot predict how the prc will interpret and implement the basic law that provides  in part  for the capitalist system and way of life to remain unchanged for years 
we also cannot predict the effect of any such action on our business activities in hong kong or our operations or financial condition in general 
any significant changes affecting our operations or financial condition in the prc or hong kong could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
the importation of products into the united states and other countries in which our products are sold is subject to various other risks 
the united states  the prc  hong kong  the european union or other countries may impose trade restrictions that could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the united states is currently monitoring various prc practices  including trade  investment and government procurement  as well as the prc s compliance with various multilateral and bilateral agreements 
we cannot predict whether the united states will take future trade actions against the prc that may result in increased tariffs against prc products  including products imported by us 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such a lawsuit was recently instituted against us and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
see legal proceedings 
we may not be able to identify and integrate future acquisitions 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions that we consider reasonable in light of the revenues and profits we believe we will be able to generate from these acquisitions 
the cost of acquisitions within the industry has generally increased over time 
additionally  we compete for acquisitions with certain other industry competitors  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased demand for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices 
although we believe opportunities may exist for us to grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms 
if we do acquire other companies  we may not be able to profitably manage and successfully integrate them with our operations and sales and marketing efforts without substantial costs or delays 
acquisitions involve a number of potential risks  including the potential loss of customers  increased leverage and debt service requirements  combining disparate company cultures and facilities and operating in geographically diverse markets 
one or more of our future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are unable to predict the effect of terrorist acts on commerce 
terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc in september of have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and other parts of the world 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states and abroad and the potential for military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in consumer spending  or our inability to effectively market and sell our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have a long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
at june   our exposure to changes in interest rates was minimal  since our long term debt of  had a fixed interest rate 
in august  we retired all of our long term debt 
we had no short term borrowings outstanding as of june  but we do borrow from time to time under our credit facilities 
these borrowings are of a short term nature typically subject to variable interest rates based on a prime rate or libor plus or minus a margin 
since we have no debt outstanding  we do not deem interest rate risk to be significant or material to our financial position or results of operations 
we do not presently use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments 
each of the our foreign subsidiaries purchases their inventories in us dollars and certain of their sales are in foreign currency  thereby creating an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we purchase certain components  raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products in foreign currencies including japanese yen 
the impact of foreign exchange transactions is reflected in our statements of operations 
as of june   we were not engaged in any hedging activities and we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
we continue to analyze the benefits and costs associated with hedging against foreign currency fluctuations
