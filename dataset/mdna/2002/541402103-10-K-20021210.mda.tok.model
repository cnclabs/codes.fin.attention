overview the company is one of the smallest publicly traded semiconductor makers 
following its formation  the company initially developed plug compatible second source products that were form  fit  and function compatible with products offered by other manufacturers 
beginning in  the company began identifying unique  proprietary products driven by its existing customer base 
while this transition to proprietary products required the company to obtain advanced design automation tools and to increase the number of people involved in product development  it enabled the company to focus its sales channels and limit the costs of those channels  and to compete in markets with pricing and delivery demands that are not as highly competitive as the markets for second source products 
the company s focus on proprietary dsp products continues  as it primarily derives its revenues from the sale of semiconductor chips that perform high speed dsp in video image filtering and digital communications applications 
the company s transition to a proprietary product focus has had a significant impact on its financial results 
in  the company recorded significant write downs of inventory and long lived assets  as it recognized the obsolescence of its more mature  second source products 
the company anticipated increased revenues from the hdtv market starting in  but the delays in the broadcast industry s transition to high definition from analog signals resulted in less revenues from these products than the company anticipated 
in the meantime  revenues from the company s older second source products dropped dramatically as they were obsoleted 
therefore  while the company s revenues either decreased or remained relatively consistent over the past few years  its revenues from newer products have actually increased to partially take the place of revenues from mature  second source products 
in addition  the events of september  and the war on terrorism resulted in the company receiving approximately million in sales to a defense contractor for the cruise missile program during fiscal with the continued terrorism threat and the passing of the defense appropriations bill  the company anticipates it will receive additional revenues from the military programs during fiscal  however  it cannot currently estimate these amounts 
the company anticipates its revenues from the newer proprietary products to increase if the hdtv market begins to ramp up resulting from recent fcc actions 
in may  the fcc proposed new rules that contemplate an increasingly severe level of sanctions every six months the licensee fails to construct  beginning with admonishment  followed by issuance of notices of apparent liability for forfeiture  and culminating in rescission of the licensee s dtv authorization 
therefore  if the proposed rules are approved  stations that do not stay on track with the construction of their digital facilities will begin facing penalties 
in addition  in august  the fcc issued an order to television manufacturers that requires digital tuners to be incorporated into percent of television sets with screens of or more inches starting in  into percent of sets with screens of inches starting in  and into all sets with screens of inches or more by notwithstanding the impact of the stalled transition in the broadcasting industry and the overall downturn in the economy  the company has greatly strengthened its balance sheet in the last few years 
as a result of the reorganization  aggressive expenditure controls  limitations on capital expenditures  and increased revenues from military programs  the company has increased its cash balance by percent from fiscal to fiscal  while reducing its total liabilities by percent during the same period 
the company s fiscal year is comprised of weeks of seven days  each beginning on monday and ending on sunday  with each year s fiscal quarters comprised of exactly weeks 
the company s last three fiscal years consisted of days and ended on september   september   and october  results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was largely due to the continued down cycle of the semiconductor industry  the continued sluggish economy  and the prolonged delay in hdtv broadcasting 
while commercial revenues decreased significantly in  the company s revenues were aided by the sales of approximately million in military parts to a defense contractor for the cruise missile program 
as the company s net revenues decreased percent  the cost of revenues also decreased by percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the cost of revenues did not decrease as much as the net revenues  as the company has certain overhead expenses that are relatively fixed  such as taxes  insurance  and lease expenditures 
in addition  during fiscal  the company wrote off  of inventory and expensed an inventory reserve of  both of which are reflected in cost of revenues 
the company s gross profit decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in addition  the gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  mainly as a result of generally fixed overhead expenses with lower revenues 
research and development expenses decreased eight percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal while the company continues to believe that product development is a key ingredient for future success and growth  its lower revenues forced it to cut additional costs in the research and development area 
this decrease was primarily the result of employee layoffs 
as a percent of net revenues  research and development expense increased from percent to percent 
however  if the company s net revenues had remained consistent with the prior year  research and development would have been approximately percent of net revenues  which is near the company s target of percent 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal while the company continues to attempt to control its costs  it experienced increased costs for the move of its headquarters 
however  the company felt the move was necessary  as it anticipates future costs for the new facility will be approximately percent less than the old facility 
further  the company determined the goodwill from the acquisition of assets from star semiconductor was fully impaired and wrote off the remaining balance of approximately  at the end of fiscal as a result of the significant decrease in revenues and the disproportionate decrease in expenses  the company had a loss from operations of  in fiscal  compared to a loss of  in fiscal interest expense decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as a result of the company carrying no balance on its line of credit for the majority of the fiscal year  prior to the line s expiration  and the expiration of the majority of the company s capital lease obligations 
due to the significant decrease in revenues and the relatively fixed nature of certain of its costs  the company experienced a net loss of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended october net revenues for fiscal were  down percent from the  recorded in fiscal the decrease was largely due to the downturn in the industry and economy  the continued transition to proprietary products  the obsolescence of mature products  and the stalled ramp up in high definition broadcasting 
cost of revenues decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to the decrease in sales 
while gross profit decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  it remained consistent at percent 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal as the company continues to focus on developing new products to encourage future revenue growth  it believes it is necessary to spend resources on research and development  including finding experienced engineering personnel 
selling  general  and administrative expenses remained consistent  in fiscal and  in fiscal 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased slightly from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this is due to many selling  general  and administrative costs being relatively fixed  while revenues were lower 
for fiscal  the company recorded an operating loss of  compared to operating income of  during fiscal this is mainly due to the lowered revenues  while costs remained relatively unchanged and spending on product development increased 
interest expense decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this was the result of the company carrying a zero balance in bank borrowings for much of fiscal and a large portion of the company s capital lease obligations being nearly retired 
due to the decrease in revenues  increased spending on research and development  and generally fixed selling  general  and administrative costs  net earnings decreased from  in fiscal to a net loss of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company produced net cash of  from operations  despite its  net loss 
while the company spent  for prepaid expenses   for accounts payable  and  for accrued expenses  it netted  from accounts receivable collections 
in addition  the company was able to produce  from its inventories as many of its fiscal revenues were shipped from existing stock 
the company used some of the cash from operations to fund capital expenditures of  and to repay capital lease obligations of during fiscal  the company used net cash of  in operations  as a result of the net loss of  and an increase in accounts receivable of  the downturn in the industry and the economy  as a whole  caused many of the company s customers to pay to days past due 
while certain customers extended payments  the company maintained its current schedule of paying vendors within terms  without drawing on its then existing line of credit 
this also contributed to the net cash used in operations  as the company reduced accrued expenses by  paid  for capital expenditures  and repaid capital leases aggregating  fortunately  the company was able to reduce its physical inventories by  and its inventory reserves by  which saved it from expending additional cash in operations 
during fiscal  the company had  of net cash provided from operations  resulting from net income of  and a decrease in accounts receivable of  during fiscal  the company worked closely with customers to spread their shipments more evenly throughout a quarter  and maintained close relations to encourage prompt payment 
during the fiscal year  the company used this cash from operations and  of cash from the exercise of warrants and stock options  to reduce accounts payable by  repay related party notes payable of  and reduce bank borrowings by  the company s current working capital requirements are greatly reduced due to the cost cutting of the past few years 
the company believes that these cost cutting actions and its continued focus on higher margin products should result in after tax cash earnings being sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
the company s belief is based on the fact that  as of december   it holds approximately million in cash reserves and its cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than its current revenue rate 
therefore  it believes it can cover its cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for the stock repurchase plan and future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
working capital the company s investment in inventories has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
over prior periods  the company  due to the nature of its business  has maintained high levels of inventories in order to be responsive to its customer base 
as it continues to shift from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products  the company believes it will be able to streamline its inventories 
it also intends to continue its shortened accounts receivable collection cycle by re focusing on direct sales to customers rather than through distribution channels 
the company relies on third party suppliers for its raw materials  particularly its processed wafers  for which it currently has only one supplier  and as a result  maintains substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
the company has periodically experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers 
as the company continues to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  it expects to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining its product offerings 
periodically  the company reviews inventory to determine recoverability of items on hand using the lower of cost or market locom and excess methods 
for fiscal and  the company did further analysis due to the slowing economy  the industry down cycle  and the stalling of some of its target markets 
the company groups and evaluates products based on their underlying die or wafer type our raw materials  silicon wafers  can generally be used to make multiple products  to determine the total quantity on hand and average unit costs 
for the excess analysis  the company compares sales quantities for the current fiscal year to the quantity on hand at the end of the year 
if the quantity on hand exceeds the quantity sold during the year  the company provides a reserve for potentially obsolete or slow moving items 
for the locom analysis  the company compared the average unit cost to the average sales price for items determined by averaging the upcoming fiscal year s price list and the average selling price of the products during the current fiscal year 
if the average unit cost exceeds the average sales price  the company provides a reserve 
during fiscal and  these two reserves totaled  and  respectively 
with the slow economic conditions continuing  the company felt it necessary to provide additional reserves against inventory in fiscal using forecasted sales and reviews of raw materials and work in process  the company directly wrote off  of inventory  and determined an additional reserve of  was necessary 
during fiscal  the company directly wrote off  of its inventory  using its prior year reserve of  plus an additional  against cost of revenues 
the company believes its current reserve of  for locom and excess inventory provides a reasonable estimate of the recoverability of inventories after applying the large previously described write offs 
although current levels of inventory impact the company s liquidity  the company believes that this is a less costly alternative to owning a wafer fabrication facility 
the company continues to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify its risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool masks with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for the company s limited product development resources 
the company seeks to achieve on going reductions in inventory  although there can be no assurance it will be successful 
in the event economic conditions remain slow  the company may consider identifying portions of inventory to write off at a future date 
historically  due to customer order scheduling  up to of the quarterly revenues were often shipped in the last month of the quarter  so a large portion of the shipments included in year end accounts receivable were not yet due per the company s net day terms 
this resulted in year end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the respective period 
in the past few years  the company has been able to reduce its accounts receivable levels through increased interaction with its customers to spread their orders and shipments more evenly between months and through added pressure to pay within the company s terms 
however  the accounts receivable balances for fiscal and increased due to approximately  and  respectively  of the ending accounts receivable balance being from one customer  who is a distributor holding products that are critical to certain defense programs 
these receivables were subsequently collected after the respective fiscal year ends 
financing on july   the company elected not to renew its  revolving line of credit with its bank 
while the company will continue to evaluate future debt and equity financing opportunities  it feels the cost reductions taken in the past few years have resulted in the cash flow generated from operations providing an adequate base of liquidity to fund future operating and capital needs 
the company s belief is based on the fact that  as of december   it holds approximately million in cash reserves and its anticipated cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than its current revenue rate 
therefore  it believes it can cover its cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for the stock repurchase plan and future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts all its transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
it is therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and does not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
however  demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to the company may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of the company s prices relative to the prices of its foreign competitors 
the company also does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments that are not considered cash under generally accepted accounting principles
