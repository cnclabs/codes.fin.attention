item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations greenbrier currently operates in two primary business segments manufacturing and leasing services 
the two business segments are operationally integrated 
with operations in the united states  canada  and mexico  the manufacturing segment produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  marine vessels and forged steel products and performs railcar refurbishment and maintenance activities 
the leasing services segment owns or manages approximately  railcars for railroads  institutional investors  and other leasing companies 
in august  the company s board of directors committed to a plan to recapitalize operations in europe which consist of a railcar manufacturing plant in poland and a railcar sales  design and engineering operation in germany 
accordingly  the company has classified its european operations as discontinued operations  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the assets  liabilities  operating results and cash flows related to the discontinued operations  are presented as a single line item in the consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows 
future operating results will also be presented as a single line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
railcars are generally manufactured under firm orders from third parties  and revenue is recognized when the railcars are completed and accepted by the customer 
to maintain continuity of manufacturing operations  greenbrier also manufactures railcars prior to receipt of firm orders and may also build railcars for its own lease fleet 
railcars produced in a given period may be delivered in subsequent periods  delaying revenue recognition 
revenue does not include sales of new railcars to  or refurbishment services performed for  the leasing services segment since intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the margin generated from such sales or refurbishment activity is realized by the leasing services segment over the related life of the asset or upon sale of the equipment to a third party

per diluted common share  and earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted common share 
the loss from discontinued operations was million  million  and million for the years ended august    and see discussion of results of discontinued operations 
results of continuing operations the discussion of results of continuing operations excludes the results of european operations for all periods presented 
manufacturing segment manufacturing revenues include results from new railcar  marine  forge  refurbishment  and maintenance activities 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all north american facilities  including the mexican joint venture that is accounted for by the equity method 
manufacturing revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended   and manufacturing revenues decreased million  or  in from due to fewer deliveries resulting from a cyclical downturn in the north american railcar market  a change in product mix to units with a lower sales value  and competitive pressure on prices 
manufacturing revenues decreased million  or  in from due to a lower sales value per unit product mix and competitive pricing pressures 
deliveries of new railcars  which are the primary source of revenue  were approximately  in   in  and  in as a result of the downturn in the north american market  the canadian railcar manufacturing facility was temporarily shut down for five months during the year and re opened in may the mexican railcar manufacturing facility  accounted for by the equity method  was shut down in january and the company is reviewing the status of this facility as it examines costs and industry demand for the railcar types produced among its three north american new railcar production facilities 

table of contents as of august   the backlog of new railcars to be manufactured for sale and lease at north american facilities was approximately  railcars with an estimated value of million compared to  railcars valued at million as of may  subsequent to year end the company has received orders in north america for approximately  railcars valued at million 
the company s backlog has increased to its highest level since november the north american railcar industry backlog has also increased significantly from  units at june  to  units at september  manufacturing gross margin decreased to in from in due to competitive pressures on pricing  inefficiencies associated with slower production rates  and the overhead associated with a plant that was temporarily shut down for five months of the year 
the effects of increased competition on selling prices and production issues on certain car types were also the cause of the decline from in to in factors influencing cost of revenue and gross margin in a given period include order size which affects economies of plant utilization  product mix  changes in manufacturing costs  product pricing  and currency exchange rates 
leasing services segment leasing services revenues were million  million  and million for the years ended   and the decrease in leasing services revenue is due to a number of factors including maturation of the direct finance lease portfolio  increased pressure on lease rates resulting from the cyclical downturn in the north american railcar market  and a reduction in gains on sale of equipment from the lease fleet 
a substantial portion of the owned equipment in the lease fleet has been acquired through an agreement entered into in august with southern pacific transportation company  which has since merged with union pacific  to purchase and refurbish approximately  railcars between and the railcars were refurbished by greenbrier or unaffiliated contract shops and placed on predominantly year finance leases with union pacific 
the leases contain a fixed price purchase option exercisable upon lease expiration 
union pacific has exercised the purchase option on approximately  railcars through august  and has notified greenbrier of their intention to exercise this option on all remaining railcars in this program 
as these leases mature over the next five years  the related leasing revenue will continue to decline 
revenue is expected to be replaced by growth of the lease fleet and the addition of management and other services 
leasing services operating margin  as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in and in the decline in margins is the result of maturation of the direct finance lease portfolio and competitive and economic pressure on lease renewal rates 
the utilization of the owned lease fleet was for  for  and for pre tax earnings realized on the disposition of leased equipment amounted to million during compared to million in and million in assets from greenbrier s lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk  and maintain liquidity 
a portion of leasing services revenue is derived from utilization leases  under which car hire is earned 
car hire is a fee that a railroad pays for the use of railcars owned by other railroads or third parties 
car hire earned by a railcar is usually made up of hourly and mileage components 
until  the interstate commerce commission directly regulated car hire rates by prescribing a formula for calculating these rates 
government regulation of car hire rates continues  but the system of prescribed rates has been superseded by a system known as deprescription 
january  will end a ten year period used to phase in this new system 
deprescription is a system whereby railcar owners and users have the right to negotiate car hire rates 
if the railcar owner and railcar user cannot come to an agreement on a car hire rate then either party has the right to call for arbitration 
in arbitration either the owner s or user s rate is selected and that rate becomes effective for a one year period 
there is some risk that car hire rates could be negotiated or arbitrated to lower levels in the future 
this could reduce future car hire revenue for greenbrier 
car hire revenue amounted to million  million  and million in   and 
table of contents other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million  and million in   and the million decrease from to is due primarily due to continued cost reduction measures  including reductions in work force  consolidations of facilities  and elimination or reduction of non essential costs 
the million decrease from to is due primarily to cost reduction measures  which include decreases in incentive compensation and other employee related costs  consolidation of facilities  reductions in work force  and other costs somewhat offset by increased research and development expense 
pre tax special charges of million were incurred during for severance costs associated with north american operations and legal and professional fees incurred at the corporate level to evaluate european operations 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for as compared to million in as a result of scheduled paydowns of debt and lower outstanding debt balances 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for as compared to million in as a result of scheduled paydowns of debt offset by interest on new borrowings at more favorable rates 
income tax expense or benefit for all periods presented represents an effective tax rate of on united states operations and varying effective tax rates on foreign operations 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations was for the consolidated effective tax rate for and was and 
the fluctuations in effective tax rates are due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses 
equity in loss of the mexican joint venture increased million for as compared to as a result of the shutdown of the plant for eight months of the year in response to reduced demand for railcars 
the company is reviewing the status of this facility as it examines costs and industry demand for the railcar types produced among its three north american new railcar production facilities 
equity in earnings of this joint venture decreased million for as compared to as a result of lower deliveries and production inefficiencies resulting from lower production rates and new car types 
the joint venture agreement provides that when certain conditions are met either party can request that the joint venture be dissolved 
such conditions have been met  however  management believes it is not the current intent of either party to make such a request 
liquidity and capital resources greenbrier has been financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings 
in  cash decreased million to million 
cash usage during the year was primarily for scheduled paydowns of debt 
all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
credit facilities for continuing operations aggregated million as of august  available borrowings under the credit facilities are principally based upon defined levels of receivables  inventory and leased equipment  which at august  levels would provide for maximum borrowing of million  of which million is outstanding 
a million revolving line of credit is available through january to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment for the leasing services operations 
a million line of credit to be used for working capital is available through march for united states manufacturing operations 
a million line of credit is available through august for working capital for canadian manufacturing operations 
advances under the lines of credit bear interest at rates that vary depending on the type of borrowing and certain defined ratios 
at august   there were no borrowings outstanding under the united states manufacturing and leasing services lines while the canadian manufacturing line had million outstanding 
the company did not meet interest coverage  debt to equity  and minimum net worth covenants relating to certain corporate and european debt and has received waivers for the year ended august  the company also did not meet a debt to equity covenant relating to certain canadian debt and has received a waiver for the year ended august  
table of contents the company has guaranteed certain obligations relating to european discontinued operations consisting of million in notes payable  million in revolving credit facilities  of which million was outstanding at august   and million in bank and third party performance and warranty guarantee facilities  of which million has been utilized at year end 
to date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantees 
these revolving credit facilities principally mature in december and the company is currently in negotiations for renewal of such facilities 
a european subsidiary did not meet a minimum net worth covenant and did not receive a waiver relating to million of its revolving credit facilities 
in  an agreement was entered into for the purchase and refurbishment of approximately  used railcars 
the agreement provides that the seller will receive a percentage of defined earnings of a subsidiary  and further defines the period when such earnings are to be paid 
such amounts  referred to as participation  are accrued when earned and charged to leasing services cost of revenue 
unpaid amounts are included in accrued liabilities and deferred participation in the consolidated balance sheets 
participation expense was million  million  and million in   and payment of participation was million in and is estimated to be million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in with the remaining balance of million due after the company has entered into contingent rental assistance agreements  aggregating million  on certain railcars subject to leases  that have been sold to third parties 
these agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental  subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount  over periods that range from three to ten years 
an expense is recorded and a liability established when a determination can be made that it is probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated 
for the years ended august  and  million and million was recorded as expense to cover estimated obligations of which million is remaining as a liability at august  capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled million  million  and million in   and of these capital expenditures  approximately million  million  and million  in   and were attributable to leasing services operations 
leasing services capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
greenbrier regularly sells assets from its lease fleet  some of which may have been purchased within the current year and included in capital expenditures 
approximately million  million  and million of capital expenditures for   and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing additions are expected to be approximately million in and will be limited to expenditures necessary to further enhance efficiencies 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
greenbrier utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
a dividend of per share was paid in december no other dividends have been declared for the year  consistent with the company s policy to manage for cash flow and liquidity in light of present market conditions and results of operations 
quarterly dividends of per share were paid during fiscal years and future dividends are dependent upon the market outlook as well as earnings  capital requirements  and the financial condition of the company 
certain loan covenants restrict the transfer of funds from subsidiaries to the parent company in the form of cash dividends  loans  or advances 
the restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to million as of august  consolidated retained earnings of million at august  were restricted as to the payment of dividends 
management expects existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financing  to be sufficient to fund dividends  if any  working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  and expected debt repayments for the foreseeable future 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported in a given period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
warranty accruals are established at the time of sale of new railcars to cover estimated warranty costs for a defined warranty period 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for that particular car type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar car types 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
the company is responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet whereby the terms of the maintenance obligation are defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of car 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the evaluation  which consists of comparing forecast undiscounted future cash flows associated with these assets with the carrying values of the assets  indicates the carrying value will not be recovered from future cash flows  the company will recognize an impairment loss to reduce the assets to estimated fair market value 
railcars are generally manufactured under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when the railcars are completed and accepted by an unaffiliated customer 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual car hire earned as reported 
the adjustment of net assets of the european operations to estimated net realizable value is based upon various options that management believes could occur 
the nature and type of transaction ultimately negotiated may vary from these options causing the actual results to differ from the amount recorded on the financial statements 
for financial reporting purposes  the company estimates its income tax expense based on its planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken on a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting their position  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
greenbrier may also provide  if necessary  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is not more likely than not 
management s estimates of the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
prospective accounting changes in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the statement will require discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  these assets will be tested periodically for impairment and written down to their fair market values as necessary 
this statement is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning september   and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting issues associated with exit and disposal activities and generally requires that costs associated with such exit or disposal activities are recognized as incurred rather than at the date a company commits to an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities  if any  initiated after december  initial adoption of accounting policies in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses accounting and reporting of long lived assets  except goodwill  that are either held and used or disposed of through sale or other means 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for the year ended august  see note to the consolidated financial statements and discussion of results of discontinued operations below 
results of discontinued operations the company currently has operations in europe  which include a railcar manufacturing plant in poland and a railcar sales  design  and engineering operation in germany 
during the quarter ended february   the company implemented a restructuring plan to consolidate offices  decrease operating expenses  and reduce the scale of european operations as part of efforts to achieve profitability in europe 
the plan resulted in terminations of employees in europe 
the million pre tax cost associated with this restructuring is included in loss from discontinued operations as special charges 
in addition  it was determined that the carrying amount of certain assets exceeded their estimated fair market value which resulted in a million pre tax impairment write down of european railcar designs and patents 
this impairment charge is also included in special charges 
in august  the company s board of directors determined that even with the restructuring actions that had been previously implemented  the european operations were not likely to meet expectations for profitability nor return on the company s investment 
accordingly  the board of directors committed to a plan to recapitalize operations in europe 
as a result  the european operations are accounted for as discontinued operations  and accordingly  the financial results have been removed from the company s results of continuing operations for all periods presented 
in connection with the plan a million pre tax charge was recorded to adjust the net assets of the european operations to estimated realizable value 
the company is currently pursuing several options for recapitalization of european operations which include discussions with strategic investors  financial investors and members of european management and will proceed with the option that the board of directors believes will be most beneficial to greenbrier s shareholders 
summarized results of operations related to discontinued operations are years ended august  in thousands revenue cost of revenue margin selling and administrative expense interest expense special charges loss from operations estimated loss from discontinued operations loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit expense minority interest loss from discontinued operations 
table of contents revenues declined from million in to million in as a result of lower deliveries due to a cyclical downturn in the european railcar market and a delay in receiving final certification on a certain car type  deferring recognition of million of revenue 
certification was obtained in october new railcar deliveries in europe were approximately in   in  and in increases in revenue from million in to million in were the result of the acquisition of the german operations in january margin decreased to in from in as the result of a lower margin product mix and the impact of lower production rates on overhead absorption 
increases from to of to were due to the higher production rates due to the acquisition of operations in germany in and higher margin car types 
selling and administrative expense decreased in as compared to due to cost reduction measures implemented as part of a restructuring in february increases from to were the result of the acquisition of operations in germany in january capital expenditures for discontinued operations totaled million  million  and million in   and the company did not meet interest coverage  debt to equity  and minimum net worth covenants relating to certain corporate and european debt and has received waivers for the year ended august  the company has guaranteed certain obligations relating to european discontinued operations consisting of million in notes payable  million in revolving credit facilities  of which million was outstanding at august   and million in bank and third party performance and warranty guarantee facilities  of which million has been utilized at year end 
to date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantees 
these revolving credit facilities principally mature in december and the company is currently in negotiations for renewal of such facilities 
a european subsidiary did not meet a minimum net worth covenant and did not receive a waiver relating to million of its revolving credit facilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk in addition to the united states  greenbrier has operations in canada  germany  and poland 
the operations in these foreign countries conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate its exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  greenbrier enters into forward exchange contracts to protect its margin on a portion of its forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales were hedged by forward exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted  it is not possible to predict the impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates on future operating results 
however  greenbrier intends to continue to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses 
in addition to greenbrier s exposure to transaction gains or losses  the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of its foreign subsidiaries 
at august   the net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million 
at august   a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in stockholders equity of million  less than 
of total stockholders equity 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk at august   greenbrier s exposure to interest rate risk is limited since of the company s debt has fixed interest rates 
the company actively manages its floating rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at august  at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
