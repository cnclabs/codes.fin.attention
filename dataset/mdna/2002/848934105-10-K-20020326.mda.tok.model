critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company reviews its long lived assets and goodwill for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if the company s analysis indicates a possible impairment exists  it is required to then estimate the fair value of the asset determined either by third party appraisal or estimated discounted future cash flows 
as described below under recent accounting pronouncements  effective january   the company is required at least annually to test for impairment of goodwill 
management believes its estimates and judgments have been reasonable in determining whether the company s goodwill has been impaired 
if  however  there was a material change in the conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  the company could be required to recognize an impairment charge

the company has an agreement with planned licensing  inc through october  the company incurred consulting and royalty expenses related to services provided by planned licensing  inc of   and  in  and  respectively 
additionally  in the company issued  common stock warrants which vest over the life of the agreement 
the company is obligated to make future minimum payments totaling  under this agreement through seasonality the company expects that its revenue will be higher leading up to and during major us sports seasons and lower at other times of the year  particularly during the summer months 
in addition  the effect of such seasonal fluctuations in revenue could be enhanced or offset by revenue associated with major sports events  such as the olympics  the ryder cup and the world cup  although such events do not occur every year 
the company believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  and that advertising expenditures fluctuate significantly with economic cycles 
depending on the extent to which the internet is accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality and cyclicality in the level of internet advertising expenditures could become more pronounced 
the foregoing factors could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on january  sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 requires the recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting must be adjusted to fair value through income 
adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements  as no derivative contracts have been entered into and there are no current plans to do so in the future 
the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  on july  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for pre acquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
all business combinations in the scope of sfas no 
are to be accounted for under the purchase method 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company  as the company has not made any acquisitions after its adoption 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
sfas no 
also addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the book carrying value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  any impairment loss of goodwill arising from the initial application of sfas no 
is to be reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle 
the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
on january   but does not believe the impact will be material to its consolidated financial statements in the year of adoption 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb s new rules on asset impairment supersede sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations 
sfas no 
provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount 
sfas no 
also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors that may affect future results sportsline s business and the value of its stock are subject to a number of risks 
some of those risks are described below 
we operate in a difficult market environment the markets in which we operate  including the internet based advertising  information services and commerce markets  experience frequent and substantial changes 
additionally  we face intense competition and we must effectively manage our growth and respond quickly to rapid changes in customer demands and industry standards 
to address these risks  among others  we must provide compelling and original content to our users  maintain our existing relationships and effectively develop new relationships with advertisers  advertising agencies and other third parties  develop and upgrade our technology and respond to competitive developments  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may not succeed in addressing these challenges and risks 
we have an accumulated deficit and we anticipate further losses we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business and it is possible that we may never generate sufficient revenue to meet our expenses or achieve or maintain profitability 
we incurred net operating losses of million during  million during  million during  million during and million during as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next two years 
since inception  we have incurred substantial costs to develop and enhance our technology  to create  introduce and enhance our service offerings  to acquire and develop content  to build traffic on our web sites  to acquire members  to establish marketing relationships and to build an administrative organization and we intend to continue these efforts 
we have entered into various licensing  royalty and consulting agreements with content providers  vendors  athletes and sports organizations  including  among others  the nfl  the pga tour and aol  which agreements provide for consideration in various forms  including issuance of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and payment of royalties  bounties and certain other guaranteed amounts on a per member and or a minimum dollar amount basis over terms ranging from one to ten years 
additionally  some of these agreements provide for a specified percentage of advertising and merchandising revenue to be paid to the athlete or organization from whose web site the revenue is derived 
as of december   the minimum guaranteed payments we were required to make under such agreements totaled  of which  is payable in stock at prevailing market prices in lieu of cash at the company s option 
see liquidity and capital resources 
also  we recorded non cash expense of approximately  in each of the years ended december  and  related to our agreement with cbs and will record an additional  of non cash expense over the remaining term of our agreement with cbs 
we may need additional capital and the future funding of these capital needs is uncertain as of december   our primary source of liquidity consisted of  in cash and cash equivalents and  in current marketable securities  which mature at various dates from january to may we believe that our current cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for such period 
to the extent we require additional funds to support our operations or the expansion of our business  we may need to sell additional equity  issue debt or convertible securities or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders and the rights  preferences or privileges of the new security holders may be senior to those of the existing common stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds on favorable terms  we may be required to cut our expenditures  which may affect our ability to expand our business  support our operations and generate sustained revenues 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable us or at all 
our quarterly results may fluctuate and our future revenues are unpredictable and may be seasonal because of the uncertain nature of the rapidly changing market we serve  period to period comparisons of our operating results are not likely to be meaningful 
in addition  you should not rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance 
we are likely to experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue and operating results due to the level of advertising revenue within each quarter 
we base our current and future expense levels on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including 
the level of usage of the internet  
the level of traffic on our web sites  
demand for internet advertising  
seasonal trends in both internet usage and advertising placements  
the addition or loss of advertisers  
the advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers  
the number of users that purchase memberships  merchandise or premium services  
the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  
the introduction of new sites and services by us or our competitors  
price competition or pricing changes in the industry  and 
general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet  electronic commerce  online media and the overall advertising market  both traditional and online 
furthermore  we expect that our revenue will be higher leading up to and during major us sports seasons and lower at other times of the year  particularly during the summer months 
in addition  the effect of such seasonal fluctuations in revenue could be enhanced or offset by revenue associated with major sports events  such as the olympics and world cup events  although such events do not occur every year 
we believe that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  and that advertising expenditures fluctuate significantly with economic cycles 
depending on the extent to which the internet is accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality and cyclicality in the level of internet advertising expenditures could become more pronounced in which case our revenues may be affected by such seasonal and cyclical patterns 
due to all of the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
we rely heavily on revenues derived from internet advertising  which are subject to uncertain demand from our current and potential clients and are difficult to forecast accurately 
currently  the majority of our revenues come from advertisements displayed on our online properties 
our ability to continue to achieve substantial advertising revenue depends upon 
growth of our user base  
our user base being attractive to advertisers  
our ability to derive better demographic and other information from our users  
acceptance by advertisers of the web as an advertising medium  and 
our ability to transition and expand into other forms of advertising 
most of our revenues are currently derived from agreements with advertisers or sponsorship arrangements 
these agreements generally have terms no longer than three years and  in many cases  the terms are much shorter 
in cases where the advertiser is providing services  the agreements often have payments contingent on usage levels 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising products and services 
advertisers that have traditionally relied upon other advertising media may be reluctant to advertise on the internet 
these businesses may find internet advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising media for promoting their products and services 
many potential advertisers have little or no experience using the internet for advertising purposes 
consequently  they may allocate only limited portions of their advertising budgets to internet advertising 
many of our advertisers are internet companies  which  in certain cases  may lack financial resources to fulfill their commitments 
accordingly  it is difficult to accurately forecast these revenues 
however  our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and are fixed over the short term with respect to certain categories 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  the cancellation or deferral of advertising or sponsorship contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
furthermore  we had two advertising clients that accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue during we do not have a long term agreement with either of these clients and we cannot assure you that such clients will continue to purchase advertising on our online properties 
if these clients should cease  or substantially reduce  their respective purchasing of advertising from us  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our revenues could be adversely affected if we are unable to adapt to other internet advertising pricing models that are adopted as industry standard 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  pricing models for internet advertising will emerge as the industry standard 
this makes it difficult to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
the rate structure of some of our sponsorship arrangements subjects us to financial risk 
a key element of our strategy is to generate advertising revenues through sponsored services and placements by third parties in our online media properties in addition to banner advertising 
we typically receive sponsorship fees or a portion of transaction revenues in return for minimum levels of user impressions to be provided by us 
these arrangements expose us to potentially significant financial risks in the event our usage levels decrease  including the following 
the fees we are entitled to receive may be adjusted downwards  
we may be required to make good on our obligations by providing alternative services  
the sponsors may not renew the agreements or may renew at lower rates  and 
the arrangements may not generate anticipated levels of shared transaction revenues  or sponsors may default on the payment commitments in such agreements as has occurred in the past 
accordingly  any leveling off or decrease of our user base or the failure to generate anticipated levels of shared transaction revenues could result in a significant decrease in our revenue levels 
we rely upon our strategic relationships in order to execute our business plan in march  we entered into a five year agreement with cbs  pursuant to which our flagship web site was renamed cbs 
sportsline 
com 
we amended our agreement with cbs in february to extend the term through over the term of the agreement  we have the right to use certain cbs logos and television related sports content and will receive extensive network television advertising and on air promotions 
this network television advertising and on air promotions  as well as the association of our brand with cbs  are important elements of our strategy to increase awareness of the sportsline brand and build traffic on our web sites 
under the agreement  cbs has the right to receive specified percentages of our net revenues 
the agreement requires us to maintain and operate our flagship web site  cbs 
sportsline 
com  in accordance with certain guidelines and restrictions and to cease using any content on cbs 
sportsline 
com which cbs determines conflicts  interferes with or is detrimental to the reputation or business of cbs or which becomes subject to any third party restriction or claim which would prohibit  limit or restrict the use of such content on the internet 
cbs has the right to terminate the agreement upon the acquisition by a cbs competitor of or more of the voting power of our equity securities or in certain other circumstances  including if we breach a material term or condition or the agreement or if we become insolvent or subject to bankruptcy or similar proceedings 
the company believes that its relationship with cbs  in particular the branding of its flagship web site as cbs 
sportsline 
com and the promotion the company receives on cbs television broadcasts  has been important in establishing sportsline as a broadly recognized consumer brand 
we cannot assure you that cbs will perform its obligations under the agreement 
if the agreement with cbs were to terminate and the company was unable to establish a strategic relationship with another promotional partner of similar stature on similar or more favorable terms  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to our relationship with cbs  we have entered into other strategic relationships with other parties including the nfl  aol  ecs and the pga tour  and various sports superstars and personalities and other sports organizations 
we rely on these relationships to increase awareness of our brand among consumers  to create revenue opportunities and to obtain content for our web sites 
we cannot assure you that a party to any of our strategic agreements will perform its obligations as agreed or that we will be able to specifically enforce any such agreement 
many of these strategic agreements are short term in nature and either party on short notice may terminate certain of these agreements 
our failure to maintain or renew these existing strategic relationships  to establish additional strategic relationships or to fully capitalize on any such relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
cbs beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock and their interests could conflict with yours 
cbs beneficially owned approximately of sportsline s outstanding common stock as of march  sean mcmanus and russell pillar are members of our board of directors and are also employees of cbs and viacom inc  the parent company of cbs  respectively 
as a result of cbs s ownership stake and representation on our board of directors  cbs may be able to significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
furthermore  pursuant to our agreement with cbs  upon a change of control we may be required to accelerate the issuance of shares of common stock valued at million  which are otherwise scheduled to be issued in four installments of million on april   july   october   and january  such concentration of ownership and the provision for the acceleration of future stock issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sportsline 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by cbs  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to compete successfully the market for internet services and products is highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
competition could result in less user traffic to our web sites  price reductions for our advertising  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete  directly and indirectly  for advertisers  viewers  members  content providers  merchandise sales and rights to sports events with the following categories of companies 
web sites targeted to sports enthusiasts generally such as espn 
com  cnnsi 
com and foxsports 
com or to enthusiasts of particular sports such as web sites maintained by the nba  mlb and the nhl  
publishers and distributors of traditional off line media such as television  radio and print  including those targeted to sports enthusiasts  many of which have established or may establish web sites  
general purpose consumer online services such as aol and msn  each of which provides access to sports related content and services  
vendors of sports information  merchandise  products and services distributed through other means  including retail stores  mail  facsimile and private bulletin board services  and 
web search and retrieval services and portals  such as altavista  lycos  netscape and yahoo  and other high traffic web sites 
our ability to compete depends on many factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the quality of content provided by us and by our competitors  the ease of use of services developed either by us or by our competitors  the timing and market acceptance of new and enhanced services developed either by us or by our competitors  and sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors 
based on our review of publicly available documents  we believe some of our existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and substantially larger user or membership bases than we do 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their services 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in internet user requirements and to devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of their services 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed by us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing internet user preferences 
in addition  as we expand internationally we are likely to face new competition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  or that competitive pressures would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
more individuals are utilizing non pc devices to access the internet and we may not be successful in developing a version of our service that will gain widespread adoption by users of such devices 
in the coming years  the number of individuals who access the internet through devices other than a personal computer such as personal digital assistants  cellular telephones and television set top devices is expected to increase dramatically 
our services are designed for rich  graphical environments such as those available on personal and laptop computers 
the lower resolution  functionality and memory associated with alternative devices may make the use of our services through such devices difficult and we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to modify our online properties to provide a compelling service for users of alternative devices 
as we have limited experience to date in operating versions of our service developed or optimized for users of alternative devices  it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in doing so and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation  support and maintenance of such versions 
if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device users to our online services  we may fail to capture a sufficient share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services 
further  as the majority of our revenues are derived through the sale of banner and other advertising optimized for a personal computer screen  we may not be successful at developing a viable strategy for deriving substantial revenues from online properties that are directed at the users of alternative devices 
any failure to develop revenue generating online properties that are adopted by a significant number of alternative device users could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on certain content providers and are required to make significant payments to such content providers we rely on independent content providers  including professional sports organizations  for sports news  scores  statistics and other sports information 
our future success depends  in significant part  on our ability to maintain and renew our relationships with these content providers and to build new relationships with other content providers 
our agreements with content providers generally are short term and may be terminated by the content provider if we fail to fulfill our obligations under the applicable agreement 
some of our content providers compete with one another and  to some extent  with us for advertising and members 
termination of one or more significant content provider agreements would decrease the availability of sports news and information which we can offer our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
most of our agreements with content providers are nonexclusive  and many of our competitors offer  or could offer  content that is similar or the same as that obtained by us from such content providers 
in addition  the growing reach and use of the internet have further intensified competition in this industry 
consumers have gained free access to certain information provided directly on the internet by certain content providers 
to the extent that content providers  including but not limited to our current suppliers  provide information to users at a lower cost than us or at minimal or no cost  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
fees payable to content providers constitute a significant portion of our cost of revenue 
there can be no assurance that these content providers will enter into or renew agreements with us on the same or similar terms as those currently in effect 
if we are required to increase the fees payable to our content providers  such increased payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
effectively managing our growth may be difficult we have continuously expanded our operations and anticipate that significant expansion of our operations will continue to be required in order to address potential market opportunities 
this growth is likely to place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
to manage our growth  we must implement systems and train and manage our employees 
in addition  it may become necessary to increase the capacity of our software  hardware and telecommunications systems on short notice 
we cannot assure you that our management will be able to effectively or successfully manage our growth 
our acquisition strategy has certain risks our acquisition strategy is subject to the following risks 
we may not be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices  
acquisitions may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  
we may not be able to consummate any acquisition or successfully integrate services  products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations  
we may acquire companies in markets in which we have little experience  and 
we may be required to incur debt or issue equity securities  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  to pay for acquisitions 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights and we may infringe the proprietary rights of others proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position 
in  we were issued a united states trademark registration for our former sportsline usa logo 
we have applied to register in the united states a number of marks  several of which include the term sportsline 
we have filed applications to register sportsline marks in australia  the united kingdom and other countries 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure adequate protection for these trademarks in the united states or in foreign countries 
although we seek to protect our proprietary rights  our actions may be inadequate to protect any trademarks and other proprietary rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and other proprietary rights 
in addition  effective copyright and trademark protection may be unenforceable or limited in certain countries  and the global nature of the internet makes it impossible to control the ultimate destination of our work 
we also license content from third parties and it is possible that we could become subject to infringement actions based upon the content licensed from those third parties 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content  however  this may not adequately protect us 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
we hold rights to various web domain names  including cbs 
sportsline 
com  golfweb 
com and vegasinsider 
com  among others 
governmental agencies typically regulate domain names 
these regulations are subject to change 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business 
furthermore  regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
our business is at risk of system failures  delays and inadequacy the performance of our web sites is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain users  advertisers and members 
services based on sophisticated software and computer systems often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors or failures when introduced 
any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users  advertisers or members and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our web sites to users and advertisers 
a sudden and significant increase in the number of users of our web sites also could strain the capacity of the software  hardware or telecommunications systems we deploy  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
in addition  if the number of web pages or users of our web sites increases substantially  our hardware and software infrastructure may not be able to adequately handle the increased demand 
our operations also are dependent upon receipt of timely feeds and computer downloads from content providers  and any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of such feeds and downloads  whether on account of our system failure  our content providers  the public network or otherwise  could disrupt our operations 
any failure or delay that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success is dependent on our key personnel our future success depends  in part  upon the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel 
although we have entered into employment agreements with michael levy  our president and chief executive officer  and each of our other executive officers  the loss of his services or the services of one or more of our other executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  editorial and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we have  at times  experienced difficulties in attracting the desired number of such individuals 
our business depends on the growth of the internet our success is highly dependent upon continued growth in the use of the internet generally and  in particular  as a medium for advertising  information services and commerce 
internet usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  such as 
the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it  and its performance and reliability may decline as usage grows  
security and authentication concerns with respect to the transmission over the internet of confidential information  such as credit card numbers  and attempts by unauthorized computer users  so called hackers  to penetrate online security systems  
privacy concerns  including those related to the ability of web sites to gather user information without the user s knowledge or consent  and 
the lack of availability of cost effective  high speed services 
if internet usage grows  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth or its performance or reliability may decline 
in addition  web sites may from time to time experience interruptions in service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages or delays frequently occur in the future  internet usage  as well as usage of our web sites could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to adapt as internet technologies and customer demands continue to evolve to be successful  we must adapt to rapidly changing internet technologies by continually enhancing our web sites and introducing new services to address our customers changing demands 
we could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to changes affecting providers of internet services 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we incurred significant costs to adapt  or cannot adapt  to these changes 
concerns regarding security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information 
we cannot assure you that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect customer transaction data 
if any such compromise of our security were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if someone is able to circumvent our security measures  such person could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet generally  and the web in particular  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
we cannot assure you that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business the application of existing laws and regulations to sportsline and its advertising clients with respect to issues such as the protection of databases  user privacy  pricing  advertising  taxation  gambling  sweepstakes  promotions  content regulation  quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement can be unclear 
in addition  sportsline or its clients may also be subject to new laws and regulations directly applicable to our respective activities 
any existing or new legislation applicable to sportsline could expose it to substantial liability  including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations  and dampen the growth in use of the web 
any new laws or regulations applicable to any of our advertising clients may reduce or eliminate their ability or desire to advertise their services on our online properties and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
several federal laws could have an impact on sportsline s business 
the digital millennium copyright act is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others 
the children s online protection act and the children s online privacy protection act are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors 
in addition  the protection of children from sexual predators act of requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances 
such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 
sportsline posts its privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data 
any failure by the company to comply with its posted privacy policy  requirements of the ftc regarding user privacy  or other privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by the ftc or others which could potentially have an adverse effect on sportsline s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in this regard  there are a large number of legislative proposals before the united states congress and various state legislative bodies regarding privacy issues related to sportsline s business 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted  and certain proposals  if adopted  could materially and adversely affect the company s business through a decrease in user registrations and revenues 
this could be caused by  among other possible provisions  the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize sportsline s services 
our contests and sweepstakes may be subject to state and federal laws governing lotteries and gambling 
we seek to design our contest and sweepstakes rules to fall within exemptions from such laws and restrict participation to individuals over years of age who reside in jurisdictions within the united states and canada in which the contests and sweepstakes are lawful 
we cannot assure you that our contests and sweepstakes will be exempt from such laws or that the applicability of such laws to us would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  we are engaged in the business of selling and providing certain information to casinos doing business in nevada 
as such  our subsidiary is required to be licensed as an information service provider as that term is defined by the nevada gaming control act and the regulations promulgated thereunder collectively  the nevada act  and is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the nevada gaming commission the commission and the nevada state gaming control board the board the commission and the board are collectively referred to as the nevada gaming authorities 
our wholly owned subsidiary  vegasinsider  has filed an application to be found suitable as an intermediary holding company  and we have filed an application to be registered as a publicly traded company 
in addition  certain of our officers and the officers of certain of our subsidiaries filed applications to be found suitable as officers of the respective companies 
the subjection of our business to the regulatory jurisdiction of the nevada gaming authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet we may be subject to legal claims relating to the content we make available on our web sites  or the downloading and distribution of such content 
for example  persons may bring claims against us if material that is inappropriate for viewing by young children can be accessed from our web sites
