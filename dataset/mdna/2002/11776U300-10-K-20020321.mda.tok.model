microsoft master development and license agreement for the years ended december   and  approximately  and of our revenue  respectively  was generated under our master development and license agreement with microsoft 
the master agreement  the current term of which concludes in july  includes a number of project specific work plans 
on july   we announced that we had negotiated in principle our renewal of the master agreement with microsoft 
effective july  we accepted a reduction in bill rates and a scheduled reduction in the number of our engineers assigned to microsoft projects 
the number of engineers assigned to microsoft projects declined for the third quarter of  an additional for the fourth quarter of and is scheduled to decline an additional for the first quarter of  all compared to the second quarter assignment of engineers 

table of contents we bill microsoft on a time and materials basis  although each project has a maximum dollar cap  and recognize revenue generated under the master agreement as the services are rendered 
the master agreement and each of the individual work plans may be modified or terminated by microsoft at any time 
although we are unable to predict the magnitude and number of future projects for microsoft  we are committed to playing an important role in supporting microsoft and its technologies 
historical results of operations the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data revenue service product total revenue cost of revenue service product total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative acquired in process research and development amortization and impairment of intangible assets restructuring charge amortization of deferred stock option compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations investment income  net acquisition related expense income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  include a million of total revenue charge for acquired in process research and development costs associated with our purchase of mainbrace corporation in may the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  and include charges of million of total revenue and million of total revenue in amortization of intangible assets  respectively 
additionally  there was  of total revenue of acquisition related expenses associated with a pooling of interests transaction occurring during comparison of the years ended december   and revenue total revenue consists of service and product revenue 
service revenue is derived from software engineering consulting  porting contracts  maintenance and support contracts  and customer training 
product revenue consists of software licensing fees and royalties from software development tool products  debugging tools and applications  as well as fees received from distribution of third party products 
total revenue increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in 
table of contents microsoft accounted for  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage of revenue derived from microsoft in over was due to the signing of silicon vendors under the porting partner agreement and the growth in services provided to oem customers 
the decrease in the percentage of revenue derived from microsoft in was a result of the negotiated terms agreed upon for the renewal of our master agreement with microsoft 
effective july  we accepted a reduction in bill rates and a scheduled reduction in the number of our engineers assigned to microsoft projects 
the number of engineers assigned to microsoft projects declined for the third quarter of  an additional for the fourth quarter of and is scheduled to decline an additional for the first quarter of  all compared to the second quarter assignment of engineers 
in anticipation of growth in professional services engagements with oem customers  we redeployed many of the engineers previously dedicated to microsoft projects to other areas of our professional services and research and development organizations 
we anticipate that the assignment of engineers to microsoft will remain at the levels scheduled for the first quarter but that the percentage of revenue derived from microsoft will continue to decline 
revenue outside of the united states totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in international revenue from to was due to an increase in both services and products sold to international porting partners and oem customers located in asia pacific 
the increase in international revenue from to was the result of an increase in the number and size of software integration service and product contracts with porting partners and oems in asia pacific and europe 
we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of revenue  although its percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
service revenue 
service revenue increased from million in to million in  and decreased to million in the increase in service revenue for and was due to the increasing number and size of software consulting projects 
the decrease in service revenue for over was due to negotiated reductions in microsoft projects  project cancellations as further described below  as well as an overall decline in the us and international business climate 
as a percentage of total revenue  service revenue increased between and due to an increase in the growth of the number and size of software integration contracts 
as a percentage of total revenue  service revenue decreased between and due to a decrease in the amount of engineering services provided to microsoft during the period and product sales increasing at a faster rate than oem service revenue 
on july   we announced that two of our customers had terminated contracts in process 
first  a semiconductor manufacturer notified us of its intent to terminate its contract to port windows ce to its processor 
we had expected to recognize approximately million in revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters of in connection with this contract 
we believe that the termination of this contract was due to difficult global economic conditions in the semiconductor industry 
the customer has requested that we maintain the code and development files should the project resume in the future 
second  an original equipment manufacturer customer terminated a large service contract for the design and development of an advanced broadband wireless pda 
the customer enlisted us to create a product compatible with a specific proprietary wireless broadband service 
we had expected to recognize approximately million to million in revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters of in connection with this contract 
these contract cancellations  coupled with the uncertainties in macroeconomic business conditions  contributed to the decline in service revenue during the second half of product revenue 
product revenue increased from million in to million in and an additional to million in the increase in product revenue for all periods is due to the expansion of product offerings and increased sales of intelligent computing device integration tool kits and ce validator quality assurance test suites  royalties received from oems from the license of our software  as well as increased distribution of third party software 
we typically charge a one time fee for a product license and a run time license fee for each copy of the application embedded in the customer s product 
the increase in product sales was due to increases in sales of strategic alliance third party products  an increase in royalty income  and an increase in sales of our ce validator quality assurance products 
our software products continue to be purchased by customers for their product development projects  and we continue to expand our product lines through research and development and the integration of products from acquired companies 
product revenue is recognized at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the product master in satisfaction of a non cancelable contractual agreement  which provides that the collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
as a percentage of total revenue  product revenue increased to in from in  and increased to in due to expanded product offerings and sales in both years 

table of contents deferred revenue results primarily from customer prepayments for software consulting projects  which are recognized as the services are performed  and from software maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the life of the contracts 
additionally  deferred revenue is recorded for certain run time agreements  with this revenue being recorded when the target licenses are delivered 
cost of revenue cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and quality assurance personnel  plus an allocation of facilities and depreciation costs 
cost of service revenue increased from million in to million in  and an additional to million in these increases resulted from the hiring and training of additional employees to support our growing customer base 
at december   and  we had  and employees  respectively  engaged in software engineering consulting 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue was in  in and in in general  the year over year increases in cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue reflect higher personnel costs related to the competitive employee recruiting and retention pressures in the greater seattle  washington and silicon valley  california areas  as well as higher facilities and depreciation costs associated with expansion into multiple locations in the united states through our acquisitions 
for the year ended december   cost of service revenue increased as a percentage of revenue over due to increased payroll costs per person  excess capacity in our engineering services teams and an increase in overhead allocated due to our expansion of facilities in silicon valley  california  eden prairie  minnesota  and bellevue  washington 
due to the billing rate reduction that we accepted with microsoft  the increased ratio of fixed facilities costs to revenue  as well as the impact of the excess capacity of our professional service organization related to the redeployment of service engineers from the microsoft engagement  our gross margin has declined from reported for the second quarter of to for the fourth quarter of due to the economic slowdown in the us and international business environment  as well as the reduction of our business with microsoft  on january   we announced a reduction in workforce of approximately  including the closure of our twenty five person professional service engineering facility in eden prairie  minnesota 
of the total workforce reduction  approximately were software engineers 
we anticipate that this reduction in workforce will align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
a restructuring charge will be recorded in the first quarter of relating to severance and other benefits costs associated with the headcount reduction  facility closure and consolidation costs  as well as payments for excess facilities under noncancelable leases 
cost of service revenue may increase in future periods due to competition in employee recruiting and retention pressures  and as we continue to expand our facilities in silicon valley  california 
cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue consists of license fees and royalties for third party software  product media  product duplication and manuals 
cost of product revenue increased from  in to million in  and an additional to million in cost of product revenue as a percentage of related product revenue was in  in and in the increase in cost of product revenue as a percentage of related product revenue from to and from to relates to an increase in sales of third party products over the same period in each respective prior year 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers  quality assurance personnel  program managers and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  and an additional to million in these increases relate primarily to the increase in the number of software developers and quality assurance personnel hired or redeployed from our professional service organization to expand our product offerings and to support our product development and testing activities 
research and development expenses represented of our total revenue in  in and in the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue between and primarily reflects the strong growth of our product revenue compared to the investment in research and development during this period 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue between and primarily reflects higher payroll costs per person  re deployment of software engineers  as well as a higher level of facilities cost related to our expansion  during the latter half of  of our research and development efforts from bellevue  washington to the silicon valley area in california  where both payroll and facilities costs are substantially higher 
as a result of the reduction in workforce that occurred on january   we anticipate that our research and development expense run rate will approximate levels reported for the third quarter of or approximately million per quarter 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  and an additional to million in the increase in over resulted primarily from our investment in finance  executive  administration  sales and marketing infrastructure  both domestically and internationally  which included significant personnel related expenses  travel expenses and related facility and equipment costs  as well as increased marketing activities  including trade shows  public relations and other promotional expenses 
the further increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in over related to increases in sales and marketing personnel  product launch and other marketing programs 
additionally  we recorded an additional provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented of our total revenue in  in and in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue between and primarily reflects the larger percentage increase in revenue compared to the growth of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue between and primarily reflects the larger percentage increase in revenue compared to the growth of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expand our sales and marketing staff both internationally and domestically 
acquired in process research and development and amortization of intangible assets

the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair market values at the date of the acquisition 
of the total purchase price  we allocated million to acquired in process research and development  million to goodwill and other intangible assets and million to working capital and tangible assets 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was determined by an independent valuation and has been recorded as a charge to expense because its technological feasibility had not been established and it had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated future lives  two to seven years 
additionally  during  we acquired two smaller companies  embedded technologies inc and toolcraft kk  for aggregate total cash and stock consideration of approximately million 
during  we acquired the business operations of a managed device service company 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase prices were allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets 
in connection with these acquisitions  we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which are amortized over their useful lives  two to seven years 
the financial data presented in the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the respective date of acquisition 
as a result of our decision to close our professional engineering services facility in eden prairie  minnesota  the goodwill associated with the embedded technologies inc acquisition was deemed to be impaired 
as a result  the remaining unamortized goodwill of million was written off in the fourth quarter of and recorded in amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
effective january   we will follow accounting guidance in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  amortization of goodwill will cease and it will be tested for impairment annually or when indications of impairment are evident 
we continually evaluate revenue  costs and other factors as it relates to our long lived assets  principally goodwill  from our acquisitions completed in and the impact of current market conditions  operational results  and other factors may  in the future  erode the value of these assets and could result in an impairment charge 
restructuring charge 
due to economic and research and development expenditure issues surrounding the smart device market  as well as a decrease in the service levels that we provide to microsoft  we announced a facility and workforce reduction plan in july in connection with this plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to consolidation of excess facilities and other restructuring charges 
the consolidation of excess facilities included the reorganization of certain corporate facilities  engineering and other offices related to business activities that have been restructured 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million for excess facilities primarily relating to noncancelable leases 
property and equipment that were disposed of or removed from operations resulted in a charge of million and primarily consisted of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  engineering and other equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
we also recorded other restructuring costs of  for severance and other costs associated with a reduction of workforce that occurred on july  due to further deterioration in the u 
s and international business climate  continued decreases in the service levels that we provide to microsoft  as well as a decline in our oem professional services  on january  we announced a reduction of 
table of contents workforce as well as closure of our professional engineering services facility in eden prairie  minnesota 
in connection with these actions  we will record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of  relating to severance and other benefits costs associated with the headcount reduction  facility closure and consolidation costs as well as payments for excess facilities under noncancelable leases 
amortization of deferred stock option compensation 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock option compensation of  in   in and  in these charges resulted from stock option grants at prices below the fair market value of our common stock when we were a private company 
deferred stock option compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the options 
other income expense  net investment income  net was  in  million in and million in the increase from to resulted from higher average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances over the prior year 
the decrease from to resulted from lower average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances due to increased operating expenses and cash paid for acquisitions  lower earnings  as well as adjustments made to the carrying value of cost based investments 
in january  the company acquired bluewater systems  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with the acquisition  we incurred  of acquisition related costs  which were charged to operations during the year ended december  provision for income taxes our provision for federal  state and international income taxes was million for  million for and a benefit of million for  yielding an effective rate of  and in  and  respectively 
the effective rate in was positively affected by the tax benefit of interest income earned on tax advantaged municipal securities held in our short term investment portfolio  and was negatively affected by the non deductibility of in process research and development and amortization of intangible assets 
the benefit for is in part related to our ability to carry back the net operating losses generated in the current period to recapture taxes paid in prior periods 
additionally  based upon our projections  the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through generation of future taxable income 
in general  our effective rate is positively impacted by the tax benefit of interest income earned on tax exempt and tax advantaged municipal securities held in our short term investment portfolio  but is negatively impacted by the non deductibility of amortization of intangible assets and unbenefited losses from our international operations 
pro forma cash basis net income pro forma cash basis net income  which excludes deferred stock option compensation  acquired in process research and development  amortization of intangible assets and other non recurring costs  is as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss acquired in process research and development amortization and impairment of intangible assets  net of tax effect restructuring charge  net of tax effect amortization of deferred stock option compensation  net of tax effect acquisition related expense  net of tax effect cash basis net income diluted cash basis earnings per share weighted average shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share

operational outlook during this period of continuing economic weakness  we will continue to focus on core business segments 
because the current business environment for high tech companies has become exceedingly challenging  we have a more cautious financial outlook for the near term 
recently  virtually all companies have felt the effect of the deterioration in the global economy 
this  coupled with the operational effects of our reduced services to microsoft  has led us to reassess our near term strategy to ensure that we continue to thrive in this more challenging environment 
as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on form q  revenue derived from microsoft will continue to decline for the first quarter of due to the decrease in the number of engineers assigned to microsoft projects under the microsoft master agreement 
however  we do anticipate increased service and product sales and growing revenue attributable to original equipment manufacturers and semiconductor vendors as us and international economic conditions improve 
because of our belief in our long term business prospects  we had decided against a reduction in workforce during the fourth quarter of  and instead redeployed those engineers who had been previously dedicated to microsoft projects to serve in other areas of our professional services organization and our product research and development group 
however  as the economy stagnated during this period  and our business with microsoft continued to decline as expected  we were unable to develop alternative revenue sources quickly enough to justify maintaining our existing level of spending 
consequently  on january   we announced our decision to close our professional engineering service facility in minnesota and reduce the size of our workforce 
in connection with these actions  we will record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of relating to severance and other benefits costs associated with the headcount reduction  facility closure and consolidation costs as well as payments for excess facilities under noncancelable leases 
we will actively market excess capacity in our facilities 
for the first quarter of  we are planning for revenue of to million 
this lower level of revenue as compared to our adjusted expense level will use some of our cash and will result in short term losses 
we believe that we will return to profitability in the latter part of once we have absorbed the full effect of the decline in direct revenue from microsoft  we anticipate a return to revenue growth 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in october  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock and raised million  net of offering costs 
in addition  in september  we sold  shares of our common stock to vulcan ventures for approximately million 
our working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of million in  million in and million in in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income from operations excluding the amortization of intangible assets 
cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from income from operations excluding acquired in process research and development  the amortization of intangible assets and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as well as increases in deferred revenue 
in  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income from operations excluding the amortization of intangible assets 
investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in investing activities in included million in purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of leasehold improvements and capital equipment primarily associated with the move to our corporate headquarters in bellevue  washington 
investing activities in included million in net cash used in connection with the acquisition of mainbrace corporation  million of cash used for the acquisition of smaller scale companies and the purchase of strategic investments and million of capital equipment purchases 
investing activities for included million in purchases of leasehold improvements and capital equipment and million in net cash used in connection with the acquisition of a smaller scale company 
financing activities in generated million due to the net proceeds from the initial public offering and from the sale of common stock to vulcan ventures 
financing activities generated million in due to proceeds from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  the exercise of stock options and the exercise of warrants by former bluewater systems  inc shareholders 
financing activities generated million in  primarily through the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options  and was partially offset by repayment of subsidiary loans 

table of contents we have a working capital revolving line of credit with comerica bank formerly imperial bank that is secured by our accounts receivable 
this facility allows us to borrow up to the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable or million and bears interest at the bank s prime rate  which was at february  the facility renews in september the agreement under which the line of credit was established contains certain covenants  including a provision requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and at that time there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
as of december   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
we lease approximately  square feet in a single facility located in bellevue  washington pursuant to a lease which expires in in september  we signed a lease for approximately  square feet in sunnyvale  california  which expires in december additionally  we have lease commitments for office space in eden prairie  minnesota  tokyo  japan  and munich  germany 
the annual cost of these leases is an aggregate of approximately million  subject to annual adjustments 
although we have no other material commitments  we anticipate a continuation of capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with growth in our operations  infrastructure and personnel 
the rate of growth of our revenue over the prior year was from to  from to  and a decline of from to we anticipate that the rate of growth of our revenue over prior periods may continue to decline  especially in light of the anticipated reductions in revenue from microsoft resulting from the recent renegotiation of our master agreement 
in addition  the slowdown in the us economy generally and recent terrorist attacks upon the united states have added economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue growth 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our technology and expand our product and service offerings 
these efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate  and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses 
we have recently initiated a number of cost cutting measures in an effort to reduce our expenses 
we cannot assure you  however  that these measures will be successful 
if we fail to increase our revenue to keep pace with our expenses  we may continue to experience losses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we believe that we will be able to meet our anticipated cash needs after that time from cash generated from operations and do not currently anticipate the need to raise additional capital 
if we do seek to raise additional capital  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may use a portion of our available cash to acquire additional businesses  products and technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement our current or future business 
pending such uses  we will invest our surplus cash in government securities and other short term  investment grade  interest bearing instruments

the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s revenue recognition policy is in compliance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
service revenue is derived from software porting and development contracts 
product revenue consists of licensing fees from software application products and operating system and software development tool products 
the company s customers consist of software companies  original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue

service revenue is recognized as follows time and material consulting contracts 
the company recognizes revenue as services are rendered 
fixed price consulting contracts 
service revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for the contract 
this method is used as management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of contract performance 
contract costs include all direct labor  material and any other costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions in the estimate of total costs

software maintenance contracts 
software maintenance and support fees are recognized ratably over the contract period 
customer training 
service revenue from training is recognized when the services are provided 
product revenue consists of licensing fees from software development tool products and operating system licenses and royalty fees from embedded system run time licenses 
product licensing fees  including advanced production royalty payments  are generally recognized when a customer license agreement has been executed  the software has been shipped  remaining obligations are insignificant and collection of the resulting account receivable is probable 
the company recognizes license royalty income as the reseller reports when it ships its product to distributors 
deferred revenue consists of deposits received from customers for service contracts and unamortized service contract revenue as well as amounts deferred for software sales for undelivered software elements

the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
management believes that  based on a number of factors  included projected future operating results and

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk 
currently  the majority of our revenue and expenses is denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  although we may do so in the future 
our international businesses are subject to risks typical of international activity  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations can vary as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended december  was not material 
investment risk 
we have investments in voting capital stock of technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other assets and are accounted for under the cost method as our ownership is less than and we do not have significant influence 
to the extent that the capital stock held is in a public company and the securities have a quoted market price  then the investment is marked to market 
our policy is to regularly review the operating performance of the company in assessing the carrying value of the investment 
we review our long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable
