our customers use our products and services to safeguard and manage their information assets and associated applications so that their businesses can continue to operate  and do so in a more cost effective manner 
on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire otg software  inc otg 
otg provides data management and collaboration solutions that virtualize storage for any type of data  including files  messages and databases  while providing easy and transparent access 
the merger agreement provides that each share of otg common stock will be exchanged for of a share of legato common stock and per share of cash 
we will also assume all outstanding options to purchase otg common shares 
the closing of the merger is subject to regulatory approval and legato and otg shareholder approvals  and is expected to close in the second quarter of after the transaction is completed  otg s shareholders will own approximately of the combined entity s shares 
this strategic acquisition will result in substantial one time charges along with ongoing substantial amortization of intangibles to our results of operations 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the areas that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition and allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns 
an assessment of our customers ability to pay is one of the considerations that affect revenue recognition 
in some cases  we sell to undercapitalized resellers in emerging markets 
as such  we defer revenue recognition until cash is received  the reseller has established a history of making timely payments or the reseller s financial condition has improved 
furthermore  once we have recognized revenue  we must evaluate our accounts receivable at each period end for amounts that we believe are no longer collectible 
this evaluation is largely done based on comments received from the customer and or our sales personnel  a review of financial condition via credit agencies and our historical experience with the customer 
the unexpected filing of a bankruptcy petition by a customer or reseller may impact our evaluation of accounts receivable in any given period 
however  this risk is mitigated by the fact that our accounts receivable is dispersed among a large number of customers 
as of december   no customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable 
for each reporting period  we must also estimate the amount of product that will be returned for reasons  including  without limitation  wrong product ordered  duplicate orders and excessive quantities 
our estimates are computed using our historical return experience 
product returns over the past several years have not deviated significantly from our historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which will result in a tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following 
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
significant negative industry or economic trends  or 
significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
results of operations revenue 
revenue is derived from primarily two sources i license revenue  derived from the sale of software licenses to resellers and end users  including large scale enterprises  and royalty revenue  derived from initial license fees and ongoing royalties from licenses of source code to oems  and ii service and support revenue  derived from providing software updates  support and education and consulting services to end users 
license revenue is generally recognized when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of resulting receivables is probable 
estimated product returns are recorded upon recognition of revenue from customers having rights of return  including exchange rights for unsold products and product upgrades 
provisions for estimated warranty costs and anticipated retroactive price adjustments are recorded at the time products are shipped 
for sales to domestic distributors  license revenue is recognized upon sale by the distributor to the end user 
license revenue from royalty payments is recognized upon receipt of royalty reports from oems related to their product sales 
revenue from subscription license agreements which include software  rights to future products and maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
service and support revenue consists primarily of revenue received for providing software updates  technical support for software products  on site support  consulting and training 
revenue from updates and support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
revenue allocated to education and consulting services  or derived from the separate sales of these services  is recognized as the related services are provided 
when contracts contain multiple obligations eg  products  updates  technical support and other services wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by statement of position any revenue related to updates or technical support in these arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
change in millions license service and support total revenue sources of revenue as a percent of total revenue license service and support while license revenue increased in over the previous year  license revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue in  when compared to  primarily as a result of the economic recession and the reduced spending by customers 
in prior years  our customers were willing to forecast expected demand for the next couple of years and purchase that quantity of licenses upfront in exchange for a greater discount 
in  our customers were more conservative with their estimates or were unwilling to make these large purchases 
license revenue decreased for  when compared to  primarily due to the implementation of our new software subscription licensing model during the second quarter of and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in sales volume of our software products resulting from the headcount turnover within the sales force 
service and support revenue increased for  when compared to  as a result of our improvement in the number of customers renewing their support contracts to over and the increased rates we charge for such services 
our increase in staffing for software support helped to increase new sales and renewals of our software support contracts 
even though overall service and support revenue increased in  our revenue from consulting and educational services decreased by million 
the decrease in consulting services revenue was due to productivity issues caused by the re organization of our field sales force  which typically sells consulting engagements 
the decrease in educational services revenue was a result of our outsourcing of this function to global knowledge networks  inc  an international information technology education integrator  in the second quarter of service and support revenue increased for  when compared to  primarily as a result of increased maintenance renewals over a larger installed base and  to a lesser extent  growth in our consulting and education services 
we expect that service and support revenue will increase in absolute dollars in  but at a growth rate less than in revenue by geography change in millions domestic international total revenue revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue domestic international domestic revenue decreased for  when compared to  primarily due the economic recession in the united states 
revenue from our oem partners decreased significantly as their businesses suffered in the poor economic climate  and our customers in the united states have reduced their information technology spending in order to better align their expenses with their deflated revenue trends 
further  a large part of our sales force in the united states is new to legato  and they have not reached the level of productivity of which we believe they are capable 
domestic revenue decreased for  when compared to  primarily due to a decrease in sales volume of our products given the turnover in the headcount of the domestic sales force and the implementation of our new software subscription licensing model during the second quarter of international revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued market acceptance of our products overseas 
the majority of international sales during these periods were made in europe 
we intend to increase sales by continuing to develop and broaden our oem relationships  increasing the productivity of our domestic sales force and cautiously expanding our international operations 
cost of revenue change in millions license service and support total cost of revenue cost of revenue as a percent of the related revenue license service and support cost of license revenue includes costs of production personnel  packaging and documentation  freight and royalties 
product gross margin remained constant at in when compared to and cost of service and support revenue includes costs associated with providing customers with services  such as consulting and education  telephonic and on site support and product updates 
costs of service and support include primarily salaries  packaging  documentation and delivery of product updates and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization 
cost of service and support revenue increased by million in  when compared to  and by million in  when compared to  and was driven by increases in the support function as we delivered better support and increased our customer satisfaction as measured by periodic surveys 
service and support headcount increased to in from in and in service and support gross margin decreased slightly to in from in and in the decrease of in was primarily due to the increased staffing to support as discussed above and outsourcing certain of our consulting arrangements 
total gross profit was million in  million in and million in  representing gross margin of in  in and in the decrease in total gross margin for  when compared to  relates primarily to the decrease in service and support gross margin during operating expenses change in millions sales and marketing research and development general and administrative operating expenses as a percent of total revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as salaries  benefits  commissions and promotional and advertising expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million for  when compared to  was  for the most part  a result of an increase in salaries and other compensation 
our sales and marketing personal increased to from in and in the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to increased recruiting costs  air travel and facilities expenses and  to a lesser extent  an increase in our headcount 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue  as we focus our efforts on improving the efficiency and productivity of our current personnel 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as salaries  benefits and facilities and equipment costs 
the increase in research and development expenses of million for  when compared to  resulted from increased depreciation expense  facilities expenses and salaries and other compensation 
salary and other compensation increased even though overall headcount decreased as of december   because the majority of the headcount reductions associated with the development laboratory restructuring occurred in the fourth quarter of the number of research and development personnel decreased to in from in and in the increase in research and development expenses of million for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits as headcount increased significantly in as a result of our acquisitions of intelliguard in april and vinca in july under purchase accounting  the results of operations of these companies were added to our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
accordingly  we recorded a full year of salary and benefits costs in we believe that research and development expenses will continue to increase slightly in absolute dollars in  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue  as we invest in developing new products and integrating our existing technologies 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily include employee related costs of our finance  human resources and other administrative departments and an allocated amount of facilities  information technology and education costs 
the increase in general and administrative costs of million in  when compared to  related to increases in salaries  other compensation  travel and entertainment  partially offset by a reduction in recruiting costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million for  when compared to  was attributable to increases in salaries and other compensation  recruiting costs  legal and other professional services and bad debt expense 
general and administrative personnel increased to in from in and employees in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in  but decrease as a percentage of revenue  as headcount will not fluctuate significantly from its current level 
restructuring charges 
during  we incurred million in charges as we restructured our development operations to reduce our cost structure and to integrate and reduce selling and marketing activities 
in connection with these activities  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees and closed our development facilities in sunnyvale  california  eden prairie  minnesota  orem  utah  and new delhi  india 
as of december   accrued restructuring charges related primarily to future lease commitments  which will be paid through  and some severance and benefit costs  which will be paid in we continue to search for subtenants for these excess facilities 
but given the short duration of the remaining lease terms and the current market for commercial real estate  our ability to find subtenants at reasonable rates is unlikely 
the following table summarizes the restructuring activity during in thousands severance and excess benefits facilities assets total balance  december  restructuring charges     cash payments    non cash write off   balance  december    impairment of intangibles 
in connection with the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of  we made certain decisions related to our various technologies  which resulted in the impairment of some of the acquired intangibles 
with regard to the intelliguard acquired intangibles  we chose to pursue an alternative technology  which resulted in writing off all related intangibles of million 
with regards to the vinca acquired intangibles  we chose to cease development of certain vinca technology  impairing the related intangible assets by million 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles was million in  million in and million in the intangible assets resulted from our acquisitions of software clearing house  or sch  in july  vinca in july and intelliguard in april see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
as of december   we had goodwill of million and acquired intangibles of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of  goodwill will no longer be amortized 
as such  we expect to amortize intangibles of million in  million in and million in in the acquisition of sch  all issued and outstanding shares of sch were purchased for million 
we also paid million to current and former employees as a transactional bonus  assumed net liabilities of million and incurred million in acquisition related expenses  which consisted primarily of professional fees  severance expenses and facility abandonment costs 
excluding sch s cash balance of million  the aggregate purchase price was million and was allocated as follows in thousands tangible assets received  developed technology goodwill  liabilities assumed  the purchase price of sch was allocated to the assets acquired  including tangible and intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based upon the fair value of such assets and liabilities on the date of acquisition and was based on our estimates of fair value with the excess purchase price over the net assets acquired allocated to goodwill 
the tangible assets consisted primarily of accounts receivable  deferred tax assets and property and equipment 
the liabilities assumed consisted primarily of accounts payable 
developed technology was identified and valued through analysis of data provided by sch concerning development projects  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  if applicable  their expected income generating ability and the associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology 
since sch had recently completed its latest product  alphastor  there were no research and development projects that were in process as of the date of acquisition 
acquisition related expenses 
in  we incurred acquisition related expenses of million related to fulltime 
such expenses consisted primarily of investment banking  accounting and other professional fees and costs relating to the closure of duplicative facilities and severance costs 
in addition  we incurred professional fees of million in connection with our proposed acquisition of ontrack data international  inc during  which was subsequently terminated 
in connection with our acquisitions of intelliguard and vinca  we purchased in process research and development of million and million  respectively 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest and other income  net in relates primarily to a million gain on the sale of an equity investment during the second quarter of excluding this gain  interest and other income  net decreased by million  which reflects a decrease in interest rates during partially offset by higher yielding cash investments in taxable and longer duration instruments 
the increase in interest and other income  net of million in  when compared to  related to higher interest rates in provision for benefit from income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes was million in as compared to million in and a provision for income taxes of million in  with an effective tax rate of in  in and in the difference in the effective tax rate for  when compared to  is primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of non deductible goodwill amortization and a decrease in foreign tax expense related to foreign income 
the difference in the effective tax rate for  when compared to  is primarily attributable to our net loss in versus net income in and the effect of non deductible amortization and foreign tax expense related to foreign income 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million as of december  as compared to million as of december  as of december   we had working capital of million  no long term debt and stockholders equity of million 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily by cash from operations and sales of our common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization of million  impairment of intangibles of million and the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million 
this was offset by the net loss of million  an increase in the deferred tax assets of million and the net change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of increases to accrued liabilities and deferred revenue of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million and a provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million  which were partially offset by the net loss of million and increases in deferred tax assets of million and other assets of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net income of million plus the tax benefit from stock option exercises of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the write off of purchased in process research and development costs of million  a provision for doubtful accounts and product returns of million offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities of million and a change in deferred taxes of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in and from million in in  we spent million to replace and upgrade our core information technology infrastructure 
in  we expect our capital investment in property and equipment to return to levels 
investing activities also consisted of net payments of million related to the purchase software clearing house in and million related to the purchases of intelliguard and vinca in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities for these years consisted primarily of proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock 
during  we also received million in connection with the sale of one qualifying accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
however  in  the agreement and related receivable was cancelled 
as a result  the proceeds received have been presented as a financing activity rather than cash from operating activities 
the short term loan was repaid in as of december   the only significant contractual obligations or commercial commitments consisted of our facility lease commitments totaling million  of which million will be paid out in  million in and million thereafter 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangement that could significantly reduce our liquidity 
further  a significant portion of our cash inflows has been generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of decrease in customer demand or decrease in the acceptance of our future products  our ability to generate positive cash flow operations may not be achieved 
based on our current operating plan  we believe our current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
while we are exposed with respect to interest rate fluctuations in many countries  our interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in the us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest in high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
cash equivalents are highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less as of the date of purchase 
as of december   the carrying value approximated fair value 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our investments in marketable securities as of december  dollars in millions 
carrying interest value rate investments fixed rate cash equivalents fixed rate variable rate foreign currency risk 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could seriously harm our financial results 
substantially all of our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore  reduce the demand for our products 
reduced demand for our products could seriously harm our financial results 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june   and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we will adopt sfas no 
beginning with our first quarter of and will cease to amortize million of goodwill 
goodwill amortization would have been million in and compares to goodwill amortization of million in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed 
we will adopt sfas no 
beginning with our first quarter of and expect the adoption will not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force finalized issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  which states  among other provisions  that cash consideration including a sales incentive given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue 
that presumption may be overcome upon meeting certain conditions  in which case the consideration should be characterized as a cost 
we adopted the provisions of issue no 
during the fourth quarter of  and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations
