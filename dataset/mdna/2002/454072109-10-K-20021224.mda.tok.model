trospium in november  the company licensed exclusive united states rights to trospium from madaus in exchange for potential regulatory and sales milestone payments and royalties on net sales 
in september  the company announced that a patient  double blind  placebo controlled phase iii clinical trial with trospium met both of its primary endpoints and all of its overactive bladder secondary endpoints 
based on the results of this phase iii trial  the company plans to file an nda for trospium that will include the european clinical trial database during the second calendar quarter of  contingent upon discussions with the fda 
the company is responsible for all remaining development and commercialization activities for trospium and is evaluating commercial opportunities for the drug 
pagoclone in december  the company entered into the pfizer agreement under which it licensed to pfizer exclusive  worldwide rights to develop and commercialize pagoclone 
under the pfizer agreement  the company received  including an up front payment of  and was entitled to receive additional payments contingent upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones  as well as royalties on net sales 
in addition  under the pfizer agreement  pfizer was responsible for conducting and funding all clinical development  regulatory review  manufacturing and marketing of pagoclone on a worldwide basis 
in june  pfizer informed the company of the results of its most recent clinical trials with pagoclone in gad and panic disorder  which did not achieve the level of efficacy established in previous trials 
accordingly  pfizer elected not to pursue further development of the compound and has returned to the company exclusive  worldwide development and commercialization rights to pagoclone 
in august  aventis declined to exercise a contractual option to continue the development of pagoclone 
as a result  the company is pursuing a new worldwide development partnership for the commercialization of pagoclone

an ind for ip has been filed with the fda  and an initial phase i clinical trial designed to assess its safety showed that it was well tolerated  with no clinically significant adverse events and no evidence of psychotropic activity 
the company is responsible for the clinical development  regulatory activities and commercialization of ip and is currently determining the optimal clinical and regulatory plan for advancing this compound as a therapy for pain and inflammatory disorders 
pro in june  the company licensed exclusive  worldwide rights to develop and market pro from hdci in exchange for an up front payment  potential clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalties on net sales

in addition  the agreement includes other potential milestone payments to the company from lilly 
upon the completion of the conditional agreement announced by galen in december  galen would acquire the us sales and marketing rights to sarafem from lilly 
if the conditional agreement is consummated between lilly and galen  any remaining milestone payments to indevus from lilly would be accelerated 
mit  our licensor  is entitled to a portion of payments made to indevus by lilly 
redux see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements the company entered into the ahp indemnity and release agreement on may  pursuant to which wyeth agreed to indemnify the company against certain classes of product liability cases filed against indevus related to redux 
the company s indemnification covers existing plaintiffs who have already opted out of wyeth s national class action settlement of diet drug claims and claimants alleging primary pulmonary hypertension 
in addition  wyeth has agreed to fund all future legal costs related to the company s defense of redux related product liability cases 
the agreement also provides for wyeth to fund additional insurance coverage to supplement the company s existing product liability insurance 
the company believes this total insurance coverage is sufficient to address its potential remaining redux product liability exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that uninsured or insufficiently insured redux related claims or redux related claims for which the company is not otherwise indemnified or covered under the ahp indemnity and release agreement will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future business  results of operations or financial condition or that the potential of any such claims would not adversely affect the company s ability to obtain sufficient financing to fund operations 
up to the date of the ahp indemnity and release agreement  the company s defense costs were paid by  or subject to reimbursement to the company from  the company s product liability insurers 
to date  there have been no redux related product liability settlements or judgments paid by the company or its insurers 
in exchange for the indemnification  defense costs  and insurance coverage provided to indevus by wyeth  the company agreed to dismiss its suit against wyeth filed in january  its appeal from the order approving wyeth s national class action settlement of diet drug claims  and its cross claims against wyeth related to redux product liability legal actions 
as a result of the ahp indemnity and release agreement  the company believed that it was no longer probable that it would have to pay approximately  for estimated liabilities that had been established at the time redux was withdrawn 
accordingly  the company reversed these accruals in the year ended september  and reflected the reversal as a credit in product withdrawal in the company s statement of operations 
as of september   the company had an outstanding insurance claim of approximately  including  of which the company paid through september  to the group of law firms defending the company in the redux related product liability litigation  for services rendered by such law firms through may  the full amount of the company s current outstanding insurance claim is made pursuant to the company s product liability policy issued to the company by reliance insurance company reliance 
in october  the commonwealth court of pennsylvania granted an order of liquidation to the insurance commissioner of pennsylvania to begin liquidation proceedings against reliance 
based upon discussions with its attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of its claims on reliance  the company has recorded a reserve against its outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  reflecting the company s best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
the amount the company collects could differ from the  reflected as a noncurrent insurance claim receivable at september  it is uncertain when  if ever  the company will collect any of its  of estimated claims 
if the company incurs additional product liability defense and other costs subject to claims on the reliance product liability policy up to the  limit of the policy  the company will have to pay such costs without expectation of reimbursement and will incur charges to operations for all or a portion of such payments 
in october  the district court returned  to the company from the initial payment the company made to the district court pursuant to a proposed redux related settlement which was rejected by the district court 
the company reflected this amount at september  as a receivable and a credit in product withdrawal for the year ended september  the product withdrawal net credit of  for the year ended september  consisted of credits of approximately  for redux related accruals reversed in fiscal  as well as for insurance reimbursements of other redux related expenses  partially offset by a reserve for the insurance claim on reliance and a noncash charge for the fair value of stock options granted to attorneys involved in the wyeth litigation 
on august   columbia casualty company  one of the company s insurers for the period of may through may  filed an action in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the company 
the lawsuit has been transferred to the us district court for the district of massachusetts 
the lawsuit is based upon a claim for breach of contract and declaratory judgment  seeking damages against the company in excess of  the amount that the plaintiff has paid to the company under its insurance policy 
the plaintiff alleges that under the policy it was subrogated to any claim for indemnification that indevus may have had against wyeth related to redux and that such claim was compromised without its consent when the company entered into the ahp indemnity and release agreement 
on march   the company filed an answer  affirmative defenses and counterclaims to the action  including counterclaims for breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  declaratory judgment pursuant to usc sections and  and unfair or deceptive acts and or unfair claims settlement practices 
the company is vigorously defending this litigation and believes it has meritorious defenses  however it is unable to predict the outcome of this litigation or the range of potential damages 
an unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is a policy that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial conditions and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements and estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the fiscal year ended september   we consider our revenue recognition policy critical and therefore we state it below 
revenue recognition contract and license fee revenue is primarily generated through collaborative license and development agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of the company s product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as contract and license fee revenue when the company has a contractual right to receive such payment  provided a contractual arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize the company s licensed technologies and is recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to the company in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
significant judgments and estimates insurance claim receivable as of september   the company had an outstanding insurance claim of approximately  including  of which the company paid through september  to the group of law firms defending the company in the redux related product liability litigation  for services rendered by such law firms through may  the full amount of the company s current outstanding insurance claim is made pursuant to the company s product liability policy issued to the company by reliance  which is in liquidation proceedings 
based upon discussions with its attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of its claims on reliance  the company has recorded a reserve against its outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  reflecting the company s best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
the company believes its reserve of  against the  of insurance claims on reliance as of september  is a significant estimate reflecting management s judgement 
to the extent the company does not collect the insurance claim receivable of  the company would be required to record additional charges 
alternatively  if the company collects amounts in excess of the current receivable balance  the company would record a credit for the additional funds received in the statement of operations 
redux related liabilities the company also has an accrued liability of  for redux related expenses  including legal expenses 
the amounts the company ultimately pays could differ significantly from the amount currently accrued at september  to the extent the amounts paid differ from the amounts accrued  the company will record a charge or credit to the statement of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september the company s net loss increased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this increased net loss is primarily the result of a decrease in total revenues of  reflecting primarily the absence of the takeda license revenue  increased research and development expense related to trospium  primarily for the recently completed phase iii trial  the  credit in fiscal in product withdrawal resulting from the ahp indemnity and release agreement  noncash compensation expense related to a stock option grant and modifications of stock option grants to a director and executive officers of the company  offset by the  charge recognized in fiscal for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the company s adoption of sab see notes c and m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
royalty revenue of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  pertained primarily to royalties from lilly for sales of sarafem 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted of a milestone payment from amgen inc amgen related to amgen s continuation of development of leptin receptor technology  funding of pro development from conrad and fhi and other revenue 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted primarily of  related to the takeda agreement  which was recognized when takeda s rights under an option expired on september  of the amount received from takeda   was recognized as revenue in fiscal  deferred upon the company s adoption of sab and reflected as a  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s fiscal results 
this  was recognized as revenue in fiscal upon expiration of takeda s rights under the agreement 
cost of revenues of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  consisted primarily of amounts due or paid to mit for its portion of the sarafem royalty revenue and costs pertaining to the pro development agreements 
research and development expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased costs in fiscal from the company s development of trospium  including the company s person phase iii clinical trial for trospium 
research and development expenses are expected to continue at least at current rates in fiscal for the continued development of trospium  including nda related efforts  pro  pagoclone and the company s other products 
total research and development expenses for fiscal substantially relate to the company s major compounds being developed as follows trospium  pagoclone  citicoline  ip  and pro  the company also incurred research and development expenses for fiscal of  related to dersalazine and other compounds and initiatives 
general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to noncash compensation charges from modifications in fiscal of stock option grants to a director and executive officers of the company  increased legal costs and pre marketing costs related trospium partially offset by the absence in fiscal of costs related to the company s lawsuit against wyeth and other decreased compensation related costs 
the company does not expect to incur in fiscal substantial noncash compensation charges related to stock options but does expect to incur pre marketing costs related to trospium 
the product withdrawal net credit of  for the year ended september  consisted of credits of approximately  for redux related accruals reversed in fiscal  as well as for insurance reimbursements of other redux related expenses  partially offset by a reserve for the insurance claim on reliance and a noncash charge for the fair value of stock options granted to attorneys involved in the wyeth litigation

investment income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal resulting from substantially reduced market interest rates despite higher average invested cash balances 
impairment of equity securities of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  reflects write downs of the company s investment in incara to fair value as the decline in incara common stock was deemed other than temporary 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september the company had a net loss of  or per share  basic  in fiscal compared to net income of  or per share  diluted  in fiscal this change to net loss from net income is primarily the result of  of total revenues recognized in fiscal compared to  of contract and license fee revenue recognized from the takeda and pfizer agreements in fiscal  and a  charge recognized in fiscal for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the company s adoption of sab see notes c and m of notes to consolidated financial statements  partially offset by a credit in product withdrawal of  primarily resulting from the ahp indemnity and release agreement 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted of  related to the takeda agreement  which was recognized when takeda s rights under an option expired on september   and  from the agreement with conrad 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal included  received from pfizer pursuant to the pfizer agreement  including  relating to pfizer s achievement of a clinical trial milestone   received from takeda pursuant to the takeda agreement and  received from lilly relating to lilly s approval from the fda to market sarafem to treat pmdd in the us royalty revenue of  in fiscal pertained to royalties from lilly for sales of sarafem 
the  received from takeda  which was recognized as revenue in fiscal  was deferred upon the company s adoption of sab and reflected as a  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s fiscal results 
this  was recognized as revenue in fiscal upon expiration of takeda s rights under the agreement 
cost of revenues of  in fiscal consisted primarily of amounts due or paid to mit for its portion of the sarafem royalty revenue and costs of  pertaining to the agreement with conrad 
cost of revenues of  in fiscal consisted primarily of  related to the amount paid to aventis for their portion of the contractual and milestone payments received by the company from pfizer and  paid to mit for their portion of the milestone payment received by the company from lilly 
research and development expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased costs in fiscal from the initiation of the company s person phase iii clinical trial for trospium  increased costs for the development of pro  primarily for product production  and the initial license fee for the licensing of dersalazine 
these increases were partially offset by decreased development costs for citicoline resulting from the completion of the person phase iii clinical trial in fiscal general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to several factors  including increased noncash charges for stock options granted to consultants of the company which resulted from the significant increase in the price of the company s common stock in fiscal  increased employee compensation related costs and increased costs related to the company s lawsuit against wyeth 
these increases were partially offset by diminished stock compensation charges for restricted stock awards granted pursuant to the company s equity incentive plan 
the product withdrawal net credit of  for the year ended september  consisted of credits of approximately  for redux related accruals reversed in fiscal  as well as for insurance reimbursements of other redux related expenses  partially offset by a reserve for the insurance claim on reliance and a noncash charge for the fair value of stock options granted to attorneys involved in the wyeth litigation 
see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings 
gain on disposition of equity securities of  in fiscal resulted from the company s sale of  shares of incara common stock 
impairment of equity securities of  in fiscal reflects the write down in september of the company s investment in incara to fair value as the decline in incara common stock was deemed other than temporary 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september   the company had consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  compared to  at september  this increase of  is primarily due to receipt of approximately  from the issuance of common stock  including  of net proceeds from the company s december private placement of  shares of common stock  offset primarily by  of cash used in operating activities 
the company believes it has sufficient cash for currently planned expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
based on certain assumptions relating to operations and other factors  the company may require additional funds after such time 
the company does not currently have sufficient funds to fully develop and commercialize any of its current products and product candidates and will require additional funds or corporate collaborations for the development and commercialization of its compounds in development  as well as any new businesses  products or technologies acquired or developed in the future 
the company has no commitments to obtain such funds 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing to satisfy future cash requirements or that any financing will be available on terms favorable or acceptable  or at all 
product development the company expects to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the development of its products 
in particular  the company expects to expend a substantial amount during the next twelve months to fund development and regulatory activities for trospium 
there can be no assurance that results of any ongoing or future pre clinical or clinical trials will be successful  that additional trials will not be required  that any drug or product under development will receive fda approval in a timely manner or at all  or that such drug or product could be successfully manufactured in accordance with cgmp or successfully marketed in a timely manner  or at all  or that the company will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of its products 
the company expects to rely on madaus to manufacture trospium for commercial use 
the company believes that madaus manufacturing facility for trospium does not currently meet cgmp requirements 
although madaus is endeavoring to bring its manufacturing facility into compliance with cgmp requirements  failure to do so in a timely manner could cause a material delay in the nda submission  fda approval  if any  and commercialization of trospium 
while the company may seek a second source for trospium if madaus is unable to meet all regulatory requirements or provide the necessary quantities of trospium in a timely manner  this could also cause a material delay in the nda submission  fda approval  if any  and commercialization of trospium 
total research and development expenses incurred by the company through september  on the major compounds currently being developed  including allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  are approximately as follows trospium  pagoclone  citicoline  pro  and ip  in june  the company re acquired rights to pagoclone from pfizer 
during the period of the pfizer agreement  pfizer and warner lambert and company conducted and funded all development activities for pagoclone 
estimating costs and time to complete development of a compound is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could necessitate additional and unexpected clinical trials or other development  testing and analysis 
results of any testing could result in a decision to alter or terminate development of a compound  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
certain compounds could benefit from subsidies  grants or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce the company s development costs 
in the event the company were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing  funding or assumption by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs to be incurred by the company could be substantially less than the estimates below 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage compounds due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such compounds to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
given these uncertainties and other risks  variables and considerations related to each compound and regulatory uncertainties in general  the company estimates remaining research and development costs  excluding allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  through the preparation of an nda for its major compounds currently being developed as follows approximately  for trospium  approximately  for pro and  approximately  for pagoclone 
the company does not plan to further develop citicoline without project specific funding 
the company cannot reasonably estimate date of completion for any compound that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty of the number of required trials and size of such trials and the duration of development 
actual costs and time to complete may differ significantly from the estimates 
analysis of cash flows cash used in operating activities during fiscal of  consisted primarily of the net loss of  offset by  of noncash compensation  primarily related to a stock option grant to an officer of the company and modifications to stock options of officers and a director of the company 
cash used by investing activities in fiscal of  consisted primarily of  of net outflows from purchases of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of  consisted primarily of net proceeds from the company s december private placement of  shares of its common stock 
commitments and contingencies at september   the company s future minimum payments under non cancelable lease arrangements are as follows fiscal year operating leases thereafter total lease payments pursuant to certain of the company s in licensing arrangements  the company will owe payments to its licensors upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  the company cannot predict if or when such events will occur
