item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lendingtree  inc was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  and commenced nationwide operations on july  we are a lending exchange empowering consumers  lenders and related service providers 
we are not a lender  instead we attract consumers to our website through various forms of advertising and send their loan requests to the network of banks  lenders and loan brokers lenders participating on our exchange 
our technology platform  lend x sm  is the technology that powers our internet based lending exchange at www 
lendingtree 
com 
additionally  we have also licensed the use of our lend x technology to other businesses and have enabled them to create either private labeled or co branded exchanges on their websites 
consumers begin the lendingtree process by completing a simple on line credit request which we refer to as a qualification form 
after the consumer completes the qualification form  our lend x technology automatically retrieves the credit score for the particular consumer 
the consumers data and credit scores are then automatically compared to the underwriting criteria of the more than lenders participating on our lending exchange 
qualified consumers can receive multiple loan offers on line in response to a single credit request and then compare  review  and accept the offer that best suits their needs 
lenders can generate new business that meets their specific underwriting criteria at a lower cost of acquisition than traditional marketing channels 
our lending exchange encompasses most consumer credit categories  including mortgages  home equity loans  automobile loans  credit cards  and personal loans 
additionally  through our website we also provide access to other realty services related to owning  maintaining and buying and selling a home  including a network of real estate brokers 
we earn revenue from the lenders on our exchange which pay us fees for qualification forms that meet their underwriting criteria and are transmitted to them transmission fees 
since a qualification form can be transmitted to more than one lender  we may generate multiple transmission fees for the same form 
we also earn revenue for loans that the lenders on our exchange close with consumers that we referred to them closed loan fees 
additionally  in most states  real estate brokers participating in our exchange pay us a fee when consumers requests that we transmit to them result in a purchase or sale of a home realty services fees 
we refer to the aggregate of these fees as our exchange revenue 
we also license and host our lend x technology platform for use by other businesses 
this enables these businesses to create their own customized co branded or private labeled lending exchanges 
these exchanges  powered by lend x  may be lender marketplaces or may provide access to the lendingtree exchange with more than participating lenders 
through these lend x relationships  we can earn revenue both from technology fees related to customizing  licensing and hosting the third party exchange  as well as from transactional fees resulting from the volume processed through such exchanges 
compared to as described above  our business is focused on two primary activities  operating our exchange and licensing and hosting our lend x technology 
our exchange business includes revenue and costs from two operating segments  our lending exchange and our realty services operations 
our lend x technology business is a third operating segment 
management regularly reviews the revenue  cost of revenue and gross margins for these segments 
no other operating expenses  measure of profitability or assets or liabilities are consistently segregated or allocated into these segments for regular review by management or in determining allocations of resources 
there are no inter segment revenues 
revenue total revenue was approximately million in the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  exchange revenue for  our exchange revenue was approximately million  or of our total revenue  compared with approximately million  or of total revenue  for this is an increase of from year to year 
as shown in the following table  this revenue growth reflects a substantial increase across all products in the volume of discrete transmissions of qualification forms a discrete qualification form can be transmitted to more than one lender generating multiple transmission fees for the same form and in the number of closed loans 
realty services also contributed million to the increase in total exchange revenue 
year ending december  year ending december  in thousands discrete number discrete number transmission of closed transmission of closed exchange transactions revenue volume loans revenue volume loans mortgage   home equity   auto  personal  credit card   all other exchange fees  subtotal lending exchange    realty services  total exchange   discrete transmission volume increased to approximately  qualification forms in from approximately  in we attribute this increase to several factors first  we believe the effectiveness of our advertising has elevated and maintained consumer awareness of the lendingtree brand 
throughout  we have continued to sharpen the focus of our media expenditures  particularly cable television and on line advertising  targeting key audiences to keep the lendingtree brand name recognition high 
a recent study performed by a third party for us showed that we enjoy an overall brand awareness of nationally among our key target audience  adults  improving from overall brand awareness of in the prior year 
second  there continues to be an expanding acceptance of the use of the internet to find a loan 
according to various industry publications  in the volume of mortgage loans applied for through the internet is estimated to have more than doubled when compared to third  although our revenue and exchange volume have shown growth both in periods of rising and falling interest rates  we also believe that the lower interest rate environment over the past year has contributed to the increase in the number of consumers applying for loans and refinancing existing debt through our exchange 
for example  in  when interest rates were generally declining  of our mortgage revenue was derived from mortgage refinancings  approximately double our rate in mortgage revenue was approximately of our total revenue  accordingly the higher mix of refinancings contributed to of our total revenue growth in over conversely  in periods of rising interest rates  we have seen lenders on our network focus more aggressively on the qualification forms we send them as volume from their traditional channels slows down 
this also increases our average number of transmits per qualification form and our closing rates 
additionally  as interest rates increase  consumers have a greater incentive to receive multiple  competitive loan offers to ensure they are finding the loan best suited for them 
looking forward  management believes improvements in these key operating metrics and the rate of growth in online lending will more than offset decreases caused by lower levels of consumer refinancing activity 
closed loan volume increased to  in from  in this increase is substantially all due to the increase in transmission volume as discussed above 
in order to continue to capitalize on the substantial increases in transmission volume we have implemented several significant initiatives aimed at improving the rate at which loans close through our exchange 
an ongoing initiative has been to add to the number and variety of lenders on our exchange  thus increasing capacity and our ability to handle different types of loan requests 
at december  we had active participating lenders on our exchange compared to active participants at december  additionally  we have begun offering several new tools to enable our lenders to process and close loans more efficiently  including automation tools and benchmark studies 
we have also implemented several closed loan incentives  including gift certificates and other payments to reward borrowers for closing loans through our network of lenders 
in addition to the volume increases  our revenue is also impacted by our pricing structure 
through october we generally charged a set fee to all lenders for mortgage and home equity transmissions and closed loans 
however  beginning in november of our revenue was impacted by a pricing change 
the standard fee for a transmitted loan request increased from to for both our mortgage and home equity services 
the standard fee for closed loans also changed  beginning with loans that originated from qualification forms completed on and after november  for a closed home equity loan the fee increased from to the standard fee for a closed mortgage loan changed from a flat to a tiered structure with fees ranging from to depending on the amount of the loan 
we do not currently have plans to significantly change pricing arrangements for our auto  personal and credit card products 
all other lending exchange revenue  as shown in the table above  increased to million in compared to million in the million increase is primarily attributed to fees that we earned from transactions involving arrangements with third party membership programs  such as delta s skymiles and costco wholesale  which allow us to provide mortgage brokerage services to their members 
we provide the loan referral to selected lenders and earn a fee from the lender for each loan that closes 
realty services revenue increased to million in from million in because we first added realty services in august  the first full year of realty revenue on our exchange was although the growth in realty services revenue in is substantially due to being a partial year  we have also grown this business by increasing our marketing efforts and adding to the number of real estate professionals participating in our exchange 
lend x technology revenue lend x technology revenue totaled million  or of our revenue  for compared to million  or of revenue for the growth in lend x technology revenue is the result of several significant new customizing  licensing and hosting contracts that have been entered into since these new arrangements typically contain certain up front fees that are being recognized as revenue over the expected term of the arrangement 
for  two customers accounted for and  respectively  of our total lend x technology revenue 
for one of these customers accounted for of our total lend x technology revenue 
additionally  some of our lend x arrangements provide for transactional exchange revenue derived from volume from these third party sites that have been enabled by our technology 
the total of lend x technology and transactional exchange revenue derived from lend x customer sources was approximately million and million for and  respectively  which represents of and of total revenue 
gross profit and cost of revenue our gross profit of million  or of total revenue improved by million over the gross profit of million  or of total revenue 
the improvement in gross profit and gross profit percentage is primarily due to the substantial increase in closed loans as noted above 
because closed loans generate a higher fee for us and because a significant portion of our costs of revenue are incurred up front related to the transmission of a loan request  when more loans close our gross profit tends to increase 
additionally  some of our costs of revenue did not increase in direct proportion to the increase in volume 
as an example  our volume based credit scoring fees increased only and network hosting fees decreased as a result of negotiated vendor price reductions that were successful in lowering our monthly costs 
overall  our revenue increased over while our total cost of revenue increased only to million in from million in as further discussed below  this increase is principally due to costs related to an increase in the number of closed loan transactions such as consumer incentives and other promotional costs 
exchange gross profit and cost of revenue for  our exchange gross profit was million  or of exchange revenue  compared to million or of exchange revenue for  an increase of 
our lending exchange segment contributed million of the million increase in gross profit over while our realty services segment added million of the increase 
we attribute this increase to the scalability of our exchange business model 
although our volume has increased approximately in compared to  a proportional increase in costs was not necessary 
overall  exchange related cost of revenue expenses increased only million  or  to million in from million in the addition of realty services in august contributed to million of this increase in and reflects the full year impact of increased staffing and incentives and promotional payments made directly to consumers that closed a realty transaction with a real estate professional on our exchange 
management believes its current staffing levels are sufficient to handle the planned growth in realty services and we have recently decreased the incentive amounts offered to consumers 
as such  costs will decrease as a percentage of realty services revenue 
the lending exchange accounted for the other million of the increase in exchange cost of revenue in  reflecting the growth in the number of closed loans in over  which resulted in an increase in the promotional payments and gift certificates to consumers who closed a loan through our exchange 
lend x technology gross profit and cost of revenue for  lend x technology gross profit was million  or of lend x technology revenue  compared to million  or of lend x technology revenue  for the lower gross profit percentage in reflects the impact of expending significant hours on a large fixed price customization contract 
comparatively  in  substantially all of our technology revenue was earned from the revenue recognition of certain fees that are being recognized over the expected term of each arrangement and from less labor intensive consulting and implementation projects  resulting in a significantly improved gross profit for costs of revenue associated with lend x technology are principally employment costs related to customizing and or implementing lend x for third parties  as well as ongoing server costs related to hosting lend x for these companies 
these costs decreased approximately million from compared to the same period in operating expenses product development expense was approximately million for compared to million for product development costs consist of expenses incurred related to the ongoing efforts to enhance and maintain the functionality of our lend x technology and our website and include compensation costs  purchased software and consulting costs 
compensation costs accounted for of product development expense in compared to in the overall increase from to is principally related to higher staff levels in the technology department 
additionally  in there were approximately million more compensation costs classified in cost of revenue primarily related to a significant labor intensive  fixed fee contract 
marketing and advertising expenses decreased million to approximately million for compared to million for marketing and advertising expenses were approximately of our total revenue in compared to of our total revenue in management uses variable marketing cost and contribution margin per transmitted qualification form as key measures of our advertising efficiency 
in our exchange revenue per transmission was while our variable marketing cost per transmission was  resulting in a contribution margin of per transmission 
comparatively  in our exchange revenue per transmission was and advertising cost per transmission was for a negative contribution of per transmission 
the substantial improvement in contribution margin per transmission  as well as the decrease in advertising costs in reflect the following in  following the launch of our national advertising campaign  we spent significantly on combinations of television  radio and other forms of advertising in order to establish and grow awareness of the lendingtree brand 
comparatively  during  our focus shifted more to maintaining and building on the high level of awareness for our brand 
by improving the targeting of our advertisements  such as selecting cable television as a primary medium and expanding our advertisements to include home equity and auto specific messages  we were able to improve the cost effectiveness of our ads 
in  as a result of the continued adoption of on line lending  a declining interest rate environment and decreasing prices in the advertising market we were able to decrease advertising spending by over the prior year and still achieve growth in revenue 
sales  general and administrative expenses in decreased to of total revenue  or million  from of total revenue  or million in while our revenue increased million in  our sales  general and administrative costs increased only million 
we had hired approximately people throughout  accordingly  the increase in expense in is primarily the result of the full year impact  or million  of higher employee compensation and other related costs 
currently management does not anticipate the need for any significant staffing increases to facilitate our planned growth 
accordingly  we believe that sales  general and administrative expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue 
another million of the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses is due to non cash charges incurred as a result of variable accounting charges related to a loan to our chief executive officer that was secured by shares of our common stock and series a preferred stock 
this loan was modified in august resulting in fixed accounting treatment for this arrangement going forward 
additionally  the amortization of the intangible assets and software related to an acquisition made in august contributed to million of the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation expense also increased million from to  reflecting new equipment and software purchases 
through improved cost management  we were able to reduce our spending on consulting and travel by approximately million in compared to our recruiting and relocation expenses were approximately million lower due to decreased hiring efforts in we have the approximately the same number of people at december  that we had at the end of 
bad debt expenses were approximately million lower in compared to due to improved collection efforts 
loss on impaired investment in february  we made a million equity investment in a company providing wholesale mortgage marketplace services for brokers and lenders over the internet 
in december  we determined that the carrying value of this investment was impaired and we wrote the investment down to its estimated fair value of million  recording million as a non operating loss on impaired investment 
in june  this company and another company merged and received an additional investment of million 
we determined that the value of our investment in this combined company was further impaired based on our reduced ownership percentage of the combined company  the financial condition of the combined company  the terms of the preferred securities issued to the new investors  and the historical losses from operations of both companies before the merger 
accordingly in june  we wrote down the investment to its estimated fair value of million  recording million as a non operating loss on impaired investment 
in december  this company began evaluating strategic alternatives in light of its deteriorating financial condition 
the company announced its plans to sell its assets to third party in a transaction in which we received no proceeds 
accordingly  we wrote off the remaining million investment as a non operating loss on impaired investment for the period ending december  interest income interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted and short term investments 
interest income decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower average interest earning account balances in than in interest expense  financing and other charges interest expense  financing and other charges consists of bank service charges  interest on capital leases and borrowings and other expenses related to our credit facilities 
the million increase in interest and financing charges in from is primarily due to million of charges related to the termination of a credit facility and the issuance of a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock and a million charge related to the write off of deferred costs associated with an equity line 
the equity line had not yet been used and in the fourth quarter of management determined any possible use would be remote 
footnote to our consolidated financial statements  contained herein  provides further details of the terminated credit facility and the equity line 
dividends and accretion of series a convertible preferred stock each share of our series a preferred stock is convertible  at the option of the holder  into the number of shares of common stock determined by dividing a the current value per share by b the conversion price 
the current value per share is the sum of the stated value per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends 
the conversion price is the initial purchase price of  subject to certain revisions from time to time for stock splits and similar adjustments 
the holders of our series a preferred stock are entitled to receive quarterly dividends on the series a preferred stock equal to eight percent per annum of the stated value per share payable at our option i in cash or ii by increasing the stated value per share on the dividend payment date 
the stated value per share is the sum of the initial purchase price of per share as cumulatively adjusted from time to time by accumulated dividends 
through december  we had elected to pay the quarterly dividends by increasing the stated value per share of the series a preferred stock 
as a result of these dividends  through december   we have increased the carrying value of the series a preferred stock on our balance sheet by approximately million 
we have also recognized  as an increase to our net loss attributable to common shareholders  an additional million of dividend charges resulting from the excess of the fair value of the common stock that the dividends on the series a preferred stock will convert into over the conversion price that will be paid upon such conversion 
in total we recorded million of dividend charges for the year ending december  if we continue to settle the dividend obligations by increasing the stated value of the preferred stock and if the market price of our common stock were to increase per quarter over the next twelve months  we would incur additional fair value dividend charges of approximately million during that twelve month period 
conversely  if the market price of our common stock were to decrease per quarter over the next twelve months  we would incur additional fair value dividend charges of approximately million during that twelve month period 
we are required to redeem all series a preferred stock shares remaining outstanding on the fifth anniversary of the issue date of such shares at a price of of the then current value per share 
accordingly  we are accreting the value of the series a preferred stock up to the redemption value of the shares using the effective interest method 
this is increasing the carrying value of the series a preferred stock and the charge is included in the computation of net loss attributable to common shareholders 
as of december   we have recorded approximately million of accretion charges 
for the year ended december  we recorded dividend charges of million on our series d preferred stock  including additional dividend charges related to the increasing value of the common stock underlying the dividends on the preferred stock 
effective upon the closing of our initial public offering of common stock on february   all outstanding shares of series d preferred stock and accumulated undeclared dividends were converted into shares of common stock 
other information for the years ended december  and december   net losses included non cash compensation charges of million and million  depreciation and amortization of million and million  and non operating income expense of million and million  respectively 
net losses excluding such items  which management refers to as ebitda  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease 
because of the significance of non cash and one time charges included in net losses  management regularly reviews ebitda as one measure or our operating performance 
ebitda as determined by lendingtree is not a substitute for operating performance measures under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and may be different from the presentation of financial information by other companies 
gaap measures of operating performance are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are discussed elsewhere in this management discussion and analysis section 
compared to revenue total revenue was approximately million in  an increase of million  or  from million in exchange our exchange revenue was approximately million  or of total revenue for  compared with million  or of total revenue for  an increase of 
the august addition of realty services to our product offerings resulted in two operating segments within our exchange 
the lending exchange accounts for million  or of the exchange revenue  while realty services contributed million 
other than the added million of realty services revenue in  the overall exchange revenue growth reflects a substantial increase in volume of qualification forms we transmitted to our lenders and a significant increase in the amount of revenue earned from closed loan fees 
we attribute the increase in transmission volume from approximately  discrete transmitted qualification forms in to approximately  in primarily to our extensive advertising campaign in although advertising expense was reduced in the second half of compared to the first half of  we attribute increased brand awareness and a significant increase in website traffic year over year to the effectiveness of the increased advertising spending 
the increase in closed loan fees reflects not only the increased transmission volume  but also to an increase in the number and variety of lenders on our exchange

these improvements in gross profit and gross profit percentage are due to the substantial increase in exchange revenue  as noted above  without similar  proportionate increases in exchange costs of revenue 
total cost of revenue increased million to million in from million in  principally due to increases in variable exchange costs of revenue

our minority investment represented approximately of the outstanding equity of that business and accordingly  it is accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
in december  we determined that the carrying value of this investment was impaired as a result of a series of historical and forecasted operating losses and the prospect that the investment might be unable to fund its operations in the future 
as a result of this impairment  we wrote the investment down to its estimated fair value of million  recording million as a non operating loss on impaired investment 
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
