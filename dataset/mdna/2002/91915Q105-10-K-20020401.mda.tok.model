overview business we are a leading provider of solutions for conducting secure and paperless business transactions over the internet 
our customers use our products and services to help transfer costly  or inefficient business processes to the internet  while maintaining trust and security in the process 
from through  we primarily focused our activities on conducting research and development  raising capital  recruiting personnel  and establishing distribution channels for our software products 
we started commercial shipments of our validation authority software products during the first quarter of we also offer secure data transfer products and digital receipt products and services  which we obtained from our acquisition of receipt 
com in december we completed an initial public offering of common stock in july  we sell our products and services to enterprise end users who use them to conduct business within their organization and with their trading partners 
our contracts with enterprise end users for our validation authority and digital receipt products include a renewable subscription fee that entitles them to validate or notarize a stated number of transactions during a specified period and receive maintenance and support services 
these customers are required to renew their subscription to continue using our products and services after expiration of the initial period 
enterprise end users who purchase our secure data transfer products enter into perpetual license arrangements for an up front fee and contract for annual maintenance and support 
we also sell our products and services to service provider customers who use them to implement their branded validation and digital receipt products and services 
our contracts with these customers specify a combination of an initial software license fee  a renewable subscription fee providing rights similar to those received by corporate end users  and optional maintenance and support fees 
we expect that a smaller portion of our revenues will be derived from renewable subscription fees in the future due to a greater focus on perpetual software licenses and consulting services 
as of december   we had over customers  including abn amro  aetna health insurance  the federal reserve bank  hitachi  johnson johnson  roche  swift  softbank  the united states postal service  and the united states navy 
we derive our revenues from software license fees  subscription fees  consulting services  and maintenance and support 
software license revenues are comprised of upfront fees for the use of our software products 
we recognize revenue from license fees when an agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
when we deliver our software products electronically  we consider the sale complete when we provide the customer with the access codes for immediate possession of the software 
when contracts contain multiple product and service elements  we account for the revenue related to these elements using the residual method as current accounting standards require 
we recognize revenues when the fees are fixed and determinable 
on occasion  we have in the past  and may in the future  offer extended payment terms beyond our normal business practice 
because we do not have sufficient experience collecting under these extended payment term arrangements  fees under such arrangements are not considered fixed or determinable 
for those arrangements that include fees that are not be fixed or determinable at the time of shipment  we recognize revenue when the fee becomes due 
if we do not consider collectability probable  we recognize revenue when the fee is collected 
if maintenance and support or consulting services are included in a license agreement  amounts related to these services are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence 
we recognize future subscription fees ratably over the related service period 
customer contracts that require delivery of unspecified additional software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions  and we recognize this revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning with the delivery of the first product 
we recognize consulting revenue as these services are provided to the customer 
we recognize revenue from maintenance and support arrangements on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement  which is typically one year 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item to this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and will be required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
no charges have been taken as of december  in january  we announced our decision to discontinue operations of our secure data center and consolidate all employees  located in mountain view  california  into one facility 
these actions will require us to make estimates that will result in impairment and restructuring charges 
these charges could have a significant impact on our operating results 
revenue recognition 
our consulting business derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
if the we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or we may need to recognize losses on existing contracts 
any such resulting reductions in margins or the recognition of contract losses could materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
although the terms of our software licenses provide for a free warranty period  we do not record a provision for estimated warranty costs  as such costs have historically been immaterial 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  or  if we experience significant  unexpected warranty costs with respect to a new product or a new version of an existing product  our future margins could be negatively affected 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
years ended december  revenue software licenses subscription fees and other services total revenues cost of revenue software licenses subscription fees and other services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired in process research and development amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of stock compensation total operating expenses operating loss other income net loss fiscal years ended december   and net loss our net loss increased slightly to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased operating expenses largely off set by revenue growth 
in  and  we incurred substantial costs to develop our technologies and software products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and technical support organizations  and to establish an administrative department 
we have incurred cumulative losses of million as of december  revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in and million in the significant increases in revenues in and were primarily due to higher sales of our validation authority products and services  secure data transfer products and professional services 
these products and services accounted for revenue growth of million from to  and million from to during  we also introduced the digital receipt and document authority products and services 
these products and services accounted for approximately million and million of revenues during and  respectively 
in addition  we experienced significant growth in international markets as we continued to expand our international affiliate network 
revenues earned from international customers accounted for of total revenues in compared to in and in software license revenues accounted for of our total revenues in compared to in and in subscription fees and other service revenues accounted for of our total revenues for compared to in and in the increase in subscription fees and other service revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to an increase in maintenance and support renewals  the adoption of the subscription fee model and an increase in professional services 
the fragility of the current economic environment in the united states and globally provide us with little insight into the foreseeable future 
as a result  we estimate that revenues for will be at a level comparable with revenue for if economic conditions worsen  wide acceptance of electronic commerce may be adversely affected 
as a consequence  the market for our products and services may fail to develop and grow and we may be unable to achieve our financial targets 
cost of revenues cost of software license revenues 
cost of software license revenues was  in compared to million in and  in these costs  as a percentage of total revenue  were for  for and for the decrease in cost of software revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to was primarily due to our reduced utilization of royalty bearing technology we licensed from third parties 
the increase from to was primarily associated with significant growth in our revenues 
we expect cost of software license revenues for in absolute dollars to be consistent with  however  it may vary as a percentage of total revenues 
cost of subscription fees and other service revenues 
cost of subscription fees and other services relate to operating our secure data center and providing consulting and support services 
these costs include salaries and other personnel related costs  depreciation  telecommunications and other costs of operating and maintaining our secure data center 
our cost of subscription fees and other services revenues increased to million in from million in and  in the increase of million from to was primarily due to increased salaries and other personnel related costs which was a direct result of the increase in our average headcount from to the increase of million from to was primarily due to the inclusion of data center costs for the first time in the data center became available for commercial operation at the end of december and as a result  beginning in the first quarter of  our cost of subscription fees and other services revenues includes the costs of operating our secure data center 
as a percentage of subscription fees and other services revenues  cost of subscription fees and other services revenues was in as compared to in this decrease is attributable to a higher utilization rate for our professional services organization in and to growth in maintenance and support and subscriptions fee revenues that exceeded the respective cost from to we expect that the cost of subscription fees and other service revenue will decrease significantly in  primarily due to the closure of our secure data center in the first quarter of as a result  we expect to incur a one time charge during to write down the net book value of the data center to its estimated realizable value 
expenses related to the operation of our data center were approximately million in  including personnel costs and equipment depreciation 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and other personnel related costs  third party consulting services  and the cost of facilities and computer equipment 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
of this increase   related to facilities costs   related to payments to third party consultants and contractors and  related to salaries and other personnel related cost due to an increase in average headcount in  as compared to these costs were partially off set by a decrease in recruiting expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in  due in large part to a reduction in headcount and fixed costs being amortized over a larger revenue base 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
of this increase  million related to salaries and other personnel related costs and  related to facilities costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in 
we expect that research and development expenses will decline in due to a workforce reductions in the first quarter of however  we do not expect this reduction in expenses to substantially inhibit the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and other personnel related costs  sales commissions  tradeshows  marketing programs  travel  facilities and computer equipment 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
of this increase  caused primarily by an increase in sales and marketing headcount in  million related to salaries and other personnel related costs  million related to facilities costs and  related to travel and entertainment costs associated with direct sales efforts 
in addition  we experienced a increase in revenues from to  which resulted in a significant increase in commission expense for sales and marketing costs as a percentage of total revenues were for  compared to in  primarily due to revenues increasing faster than expenses 
during  we opened international sales offices in argentina  germany  singapore and spain 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
of this increase  million related to salaries and other personnel related costs  million related to marketing programs and  related to increased travel costs in connection with our focus on expanding our international revenues 
sales and marketing costs as a percentage of total revenues was in compared to in  because our revenues increased at a faster pace than related expenses 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decline in absolute dollars in primarily due to a reductions in workforce in the first quarter of  but will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and other personnel related costs for our administrative  finance  and human resources employees  legal and accounting services  and facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
of this increase   related to salaries and other personnel related costs 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
of this increase  million related to salaries and other personnel related costs   related to facilities and  related to consulting and outside services 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues were in  compared to in because our revenues increased at a faster pace than our expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will not increase significantly in absolute dollars  but will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue for the foreseeable future 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development of million was incurred in for our acquisition of receipt 
com and was charged to expense 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles  related to the acquisition of receipt 
com was million in in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets on january   we will no longer amortize goodwill or certain intangibles 
this will result in a decrease in annual amortization of million 
amortization of stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted and the estimated fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
as of december   we had recorded deferred stock compensation of million for stock options we assumed as part of our acquisition of receipt 
com and an additional million related to the grant of other employee stock options net of million reversed due to the cancellation of options of terminated employees 
deferred stock compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options generally four years through september   which resulted in an expense of million in and million in we expect amortization of deferred stock compensation to decrease in due to the cancellation of additional options as a result of our recent reductions in workforce 
other income expense 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a decrease in our cash and investment balances and lower interest rates earned on our investments 
interest and other expenses decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a decrease in interest costs on our equipment loans and leases  partially offset by increased losses on foreign exchange 
interest income increased to million in from  in  primarily due to interest earned on the proceeds from our initial public offering in july interest and other expenses increased to  in from  in  primarily due to increased balances outstanding on our equipment loans and leases  a  charge to write down the value of an option to acquire securities and losses on foreign exchange 
income taxes 
we have incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any material tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times through we have taken a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million at december  due to our assessment that it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the benefits of these assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
when and if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  we will reduce the valuation allowance 
we do not expect to reduce the valuation allowance during liquidity and capital resources funding to date in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock that resulted in raising additional equity  net of offering costs  of approximately million 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in june  we entered into a million common stock equity line with rellian investments limited  pursuant to which  in the event we draw down on the line of credit  we may be required to issue up to  shares of our common stock 
in the same transaction  we issued a warrant to rellian investments limited for  shares of our common stock and a warrant to pacific crest securities  inc for  shares of our common stock 
we are able to draw down on the common stock equity line on a monthly basis subject to certain conditions 
the formula used to calculate the amount available includes a specified percentage of the total trading volume and volume weighted average price of our stock over the sixty calendar days prior to the draw  less a discount 
for the month ended december   the maximum amount that would have been available was approximately in november  we sold  shares of our common stock and issued warrants exercisable for  shares of our common stock to certain investors pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to provide working capital and otherwise fund our operations 
in december  we purchased certain assets of tradenable  inc pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to tradenable  inc uses of cash net cash used in operating activities of million in  million in  and million in was primarily used to fund our net losses 
net cash used for operating activities in related primarily to a net loss of million partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization expenses of million and other changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million in   in and million in net cash used in investing activities in primarily related to net purchases of short term investments of million and capital equipment expenditures of million 
capital equipment expenditures primarily related to the purchase of computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment  and leasehold improvements 
we do not expect to substantially increase our capital expenditures in the foreseeable future  nor do we anticipate incurring any significant new lease commitments 
we anticipate using available cash to provide working capital and otherwise fund our operations and to purchase capital equipment and make leasehold improvements 
sources of cash net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in was provided primarily from sales of million of our common stock to private investors and the proceeds of  due to the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
future funding requirements during the first quarter of  we consolidated our corporate facilities and discontinued our secure data center operations 
as a result  we reduced our workforce from to accordingly  we do not expect operating expenses to increase significantly over the next several quarters 
if we need additional funding  we may be able to draw upon our equity line facility  which we entered into in june under this facility we may be able to issue up to million of our common stock 
however  our ability to draw on this facility is subject to various conditions  including a maximum percentage of total shares of our common stock that we may issue  a minimum draw amount  a maximum percentage of our total shares that the underwriter may purchase  a maximum share price  and continued registration of the shares 
at any given time  we may not be able meet one or more of these conditions 
we anticipate that our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will constitute the most significant use of our cash resources 
we may also utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  technologies and product lines 
we expect payments for operating leases and repayment of debt to be approximately million and million  respectively  during we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next months 
after that  we may require additional funds 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any additional financing may dilute your ownership interest in valicert 
new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june  must be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but will be tested at least annually for impairment 
we will adopt sfas no 
and on january  upon adoption of sfas  we will stop the amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce with a net carrying value of million at december  and annual amortization of million that resulted from business combinations completed prior to the adoption of sfas no 
we have evaluated goodwill under sfas no 
and have determined that the initial adoption of this standard will not result in an impairment charge 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb no 
to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
we will adopt sfas on january   and have not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 
certain relationships and related transactions loans to officers since january   the officers listed below have executed promissory notes and pledge agreements to finance the exercise of their stock options 
each note bears interest at per year and has a term of five years from the date of issuance 
as collateral  the note holder of the shares of stock purchased with each note pledged to us shares of stock of value equal to or greater than the principal amount of the note 
each note represents a debt to us that the holder must repay  with interest  by the earliest of the maturity date of the note  the termination of the holder s employment with us  a default in the payment of any installment of principal when due  a sale of the stock pledge as collateral  or any other date reasonably necessary for us to comply with any regulations adopted by the board of governors of the federal reserve system affecting the extension of credit for our securities

factors that may impact future results risks related to our business because we have a limited operating history  it is difficult for us to evaluate our prospects 
we introduced our first commercial product in the first quarter of and have generated only limited revenues 
because we have a limited operating history with our products and services  and because our sources of potential revenue may continue to shift as our business develops  our future operating results and our future stock prices are difficult to predict 
our success also depends in part on the rate and timing of the growth and use of the internet for electronic commerce and communications  the acceptance of existing security measures as adequate for electronic commerce and communications over the internet  the rate and timing of the growth and use of specific technologies such as public key infrastructure and electronic payments and other internet security technologies  our ability to maintain our current  and enter into additional  strategic relationships  and our ability to effectively manage our growth and to attract and retain skilled professionals 
if any of these risks develop  our business could be seriously harmed 
our sales cycle causes unpredictable variations in our operating results which could cause our stock price to decline 
the length of our sales cycle is uncertain  which makes it difficult to accurately forecast the quarter in which our sales will occur 
this may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
we spend considerable time and expense providing information to prospective customers about the use and benefits of our products and services without generating corresponding revenue 
our expense levels are relatively fixed and we do not know when particular sales efforts will begin to generate revenues 
prospective customers of our products and services often require long testing and approval processes before making a purchase decision 
the process of entering into a licensing arrangement with a potential customer may involve lengthy negotiations 
in the past  our sales cycle has ranged from one to nine or more months 
our sales cycle is also subject to delays because we have little or no control over customer specific factors  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures 
because our technology must often be integrated with the products and services of other vendors  there may be a significant delay between the use of our software and services in a pilot system and its commercial deployment by our customers 
because the length of our sales cycle is uncertain  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly results depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our quarterly results depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our quarterly results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the following the size  timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders  the timing of releases of our new software products  the number of transactions conducted using our products and services  the long sales cycles for  and complexity of  our software products and services  the timing and execution of large individual contracts  the impact of changes in the pricing models for our software products and services or our competitors products and services  and the continued development of our direct and indirect distribution channels 
due to these and other factors  our operating results in some future quarter or quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts who might follow our stock 
we have not been profitable  and if we do not achieve profitability  our business may fail 
we have incurred significant net losses 
we incurred net losses of million in and million in as of december   we had incurred cumulative losses of million 
you should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance 
we may not sustain similar levels of growth in future periods and our revenues could decline  and we may not become profitable or significantly increase our revenues 
recovery of the current economic environment in the united states and globally provide us with little insight into the foreseeable future 
as a result  we estimate that revenues for will approximately the level achieved in if economic conditions worsen  wide acceptance of electronic commerce may be adverse affected 
as a consequence  the market for our products and services may fail to develop and grow and we may be unable to achieve our financial targets 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if our revenues grow more slowly or decline  if our gross margins do not improve  or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our operating results will suffer and our stock price may fall 
if we do not successfully develop new products and services to respond to rapid market changes due to changing technology and evolving industry standards  our business will be harmed 
our success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to offer products and services that incorporate leading technology and to respond to technological advances 
if we fail to offer products and services that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances and emerging standards  we may not generate sufficient revenues to offset our development costs and other expenses  which will hurt our business 
the development of new or enhanced products and services is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience development  marketing and other technological difficulties that may delay or limit our ability to respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards  competitive developments or customer requirements 
you should also be aware that our technology or systems may become obsolete upon the introduction of alternative technologies  we may incur substantial costs if we need to modify our products and services to respond to these alternative technologies  we may not have sufficient resources to develop or acquire new technologies or to introduce new products or services capable of competing with future technologies  we may be unable to acquire the rights to use the intellectual property necessary to implement new technology  and when introducing new or enhanced products or services  we may be unable to manage effectively the transition from older products and services 
we rely on  and expect to continue to rely on  a limited number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenues  and if any of these or other significant customers stops licensing our software products and services  our revenues could decline 
a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
in  two customers accounted for and of the total revenues 
in  no individual customer accounted for more than of total revenues 
we anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers that obligate them to license our software products or use our services 
we cannot be certain that we will retain our customers or that we will be able to obtain new customers 
if we were to lose one or more customers  our revenues could decline 
the length of our sales cycle is uncertain  which may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
any failure of our sales efforts to generate revenues at the times and in the amounts we anticipate could cause significant variations in our operating results 
during our sales cycle  we spend considerable time and expense providing information to prospective customers about the use and benefits of our products and services without generating corresponding revenue 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and there is substantial uncertainty as to when particular sales efforts will begin to generate revenues 
one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative alliances to increase the adoption of our products and services 
prospective customers of our products and services often require long testing and approval processes before making a purchase decision 
in general  the process of entering into a licensing arrangement with a potential customer may involve lengthy negotiations 
as a result  our sales cycle has been and may continue to be unpredictable 
in the past  our sales cycle has ranged from one to nine or more months 
our sales cycle is also subject to delays as a result of customer specific factors over which we have little or no control  including budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures 
in addition  because our technology must often be integrated with the products and services of other vendors  there may be a significant delay between the use of our software and services in a pilot system and its commercial deployment by our customers 
the length of the sales cycle makes it difficult to accurately forecast the timing and amount of our sales 
thus this may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could harm our business 
our international business exposes us to additional risks 
products and services provided to our international customers accounted for of our revenues in and of our revenues in we intend to expand our international business in the future 
conducting business outside of the united states subjects us to additional risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  evolving privacy laws  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivables  and difficulties in authenticating customer information 
we must maintain and enter into new strategic alliances  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
one of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic or other similar collaborative alliances in order to reach a larger customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
we will need to maintain or enter into additional strategic alliances to execute our business plan 
however  if we are unable to maintain our strategic alliances or enter into additional strategic alliances  our business could be materially harmed 
we may not be able to enter into additional strategic alliances or maintain our existing strategic alliances 
if we do not  we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution  sales and marketing of our security products and services than we would otherwise 
we have entered into technology  marketing and distribution agreements with several companies 
however  we may be unable to leverage the brand and distribution power of these strategic alliances to increase the adoption rate of our technology 
we have been establishing strategic alliances to ensure that third party solutions are interoperable with our software products and services 
to the extent that our products are not interoperable or our strategic allies choose not to integrate our technology into their offerings  this failure would inhibit the adoption of our software products and outsourced services 
furthermore  as a result of our emphasis on these strategic alliances  our success will depend in part on the ultimate success of other parties to these alliances 
failure of one or more of our strategic alliances to achieve any of these objectives could materially harm our business 
our existing strategic alliances do not  and any future strategic alliances may not  grant us exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
in addition  the other parties may not view their alliances with us as significant for their own businesses 
therefore  they could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future 
these parties could also pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products and services  either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
should any of these developments occur  our business will be harmed 
any future acquisitions of companies or technologies may not be successful and as a result  could harm our business 
we may acquire businesses  technologies  product lines or service offerings which may need to be integrated with our business in the future 
acquisitions involve a number of risks including  among others the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  to the extent the acquisitions are financed with our common stock  dilution to our existing stockholders  our inability to integrate  train  retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of our management from our day to day operations  our inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our software products and services  the additional expense associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets  the potential impairment of relationships with our employees  customers and strategic third parties  and the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business could be materially harmed 
our headquarters are located in northern california where natural or other disasters may occur that could disrupt our operations and our business 
our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our and our manufacturer s property 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war targeted at the united states  and specifically silicon valley  could cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and resellers  and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and a recurrence of california s energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our operating costs 
our principal operating facilities are located in california 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and california experienced an energy crisis in the recurrence of an energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  that is  when power reserves for california fall below  electricity providers have on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts 
if such blackouts interrupt our power supply  we may be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development of our products and our manufacturing processes 
continuing power interruption could delay production to the extent it could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
to date  we have not experienced any significant or repeated power disruptions that have had a material impact on our business operations 
however  in addition to possible power disruptions  the recurrence of an energy crisis may also cause natural gas and electricity prices to rise significantly  relative to the rest of the united states  and our operating expenses may increase 
our success depends on our ability to grow and develop our direct sales and indirect distribution channels 
our failure to grow and develop our direct sales channel and increase the number of our indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must increase the number of strategic and other third party relationships with vendors of internet related systems and application software  resellers and systems integrators 
our existing or future channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
we depend upon certificate status data made available by third parties  if our access to that data is limited or denied  our revenues could decline 
our business depends upon our continuing access to data for the issuance and revocation of digital certificates by certificate authorities and other third parties  including businesses and governmental entities 
we depend upon our ability to negotiate arrangements with these certificate authorities  some of which are our competitors  and other third parties to make this data available to us 
if our access to this data is limited or denied by one or more certificate authorities or other third parties  our ability to verify and validate digital certificates would be impaired  perhaps severely  which could cause a decline in our revenues and in the value of your investment 
since we sell through multiple channels and distribution channels  we may have to resolve potential conflicts between these channels 
since we sell through multiple channels and distribution networks  we may have to resolve potential conflicts between these channels 
for example  these conflicts may result from the different discount levels offered by multiple channel partners to their customers or  potentially  from our direct sales force targeting the same accounts as our indirect channel partners 
such conflicts may harm our business or reputation 
we are dependent on technologies provided by third parties  and any termination of our right to use these technologies could increase our costs  delay product development and harm our reputation 
we have developed our products and services partially based on technology we license on a non exclusive basis from third parties 
our inability to continue to license these third party technologies on commercially reasonable terms will harm our business 
we expect that  in the future  we will continue to have to license technologies from third parties 
our inability to continue to license on commercially reasonable terms  one or more of the technologies that we currently use or our failure to obtain the right to use future technologies could increase our costs and delay or possibly prevent product development 
our existing licensing agreements may be terminated by the other parties to these contracts  or may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we may not be able to license new technologies on favorable terms  if at all 
if we lose the services of our senior management or key personnel  our ability to develop our business and secure customer relationships will suffer 
we are substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not maintain key person insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees  particularly joseph yosi amram  our president and chief executive officer  and srinivasan chini krishnan  our founder and chairman  could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives 
we may be unable to retain qualified personnel  which could harm our business and product development 
we also must continue to train  retain  and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
due to the workforce reductions that we completed in the second quarter of and the first quarter of  the moral of our remaining employees may decrease  and we may be unable to retain them 
in addition  if our stock price decreases substantially  it may be more difficult to retain employees who consider stock options an important part of their compensation package 
if we encounter difficulties retaining software engineering personnel at a critical stage of product development  our relationship with existing and future customers could be harmed 
the failure to retain necessary technical  managerial  sales  marketing and professional services personnel could harm our business and our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products 
our business will suffer if we are unable to protect our intellectual property 
we rely upon copyrights  trade secrets  know how  patents  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our market position 
we rely on outside licensors for patent and software license rights in encryption technology that is incorporated into and is necessary for the operation of our products and services 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of our products and services 
any inability to continue to procure or use this technology could be materially adverse to our operations 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement  misappropriation  duplication and discovery by third parties 
we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology or gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
attempts by others to utilize our intellectual property rights could undermine our ability to retain or secure customers 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights could be time consuming and costly 
we cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or that any patents that are issued will be enforceable or valid 
additionally  the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our issued patent or pending patent applications or that we are the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
moreover  we may have to participate in interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute 
any claim of infringement by third parties could be costly to defend  and if we are found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  we may be required to pay substantial licensing fees 
we may increasingly become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of their products and services increasingly overlaps with ours 
because we are in a new and evolving field  customers may demand features which will subject us to a greater likelihood of claims of infringement 
we are aware of pending and issued united states and foreign patent rights owned by third parties that relate to cryptography technology 
third parties may assert that we infringe their intellectual property rights based upon issued patents  trade secrets or know how that they believe cover our technology 
in addition  future patents may issue to third parties which we may infringe 
it may be time consuming and costly to defend ourselves against any of these claims and we cannot assure you that we would prevail 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the united states and abroad 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain one or more licenses from or pay royalties to third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any such licenses at a reasonable cost  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain such license could hurt our business 
defects in our software products and services could diminish demand for our products and services  which may harm our business 
because our products and services are complex and may contain errors or defects that are not found until after they are used by our customers  any undiscovered errors or defects could seriously harm our reputation and our ability to generate sales to new or existing customers 
our software products and services are complex and are generally used in systems with other vendors products 
they can be adequately tested only when they are successfully integrated with these systems 
errors may be found in new products or releases after shipment and our products and services may not operate as expected 
errors or defects in our products and services could result in loss of revenues and increased service and warranty costs  delay in market acceptance  loss of salaries  and injury to our reputation 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services 
we may need to seek additional funding in the future 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we may also be required to reduce operating costs through lay offs or reduce our sales and marketing or research and development efforts 
if we issue equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
failure to increase our brand awareness could limit our ability to compete effectively 
if the marketplace does not associate us with high quality  end to end secure infrastructure software products and services  it may be difficult for us to keep our existing customers  attract new customers or successfully introduce new products and services 
competitive and other pressures may require us to increase our expenses to promote our brand name  and the benefits associated with brand creation may not outweigh the risks and costs associated with establishing our brand name 
our failure to develop a strong brand name or the incurrence of excessive costs associated with establishing our brand name may harm our business 
we rely on public key cryptography and other security techniques that could be breached  resulting in reduced demand for our products and services 
a requirement for the continued growth of electronic commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and private key  for encoding and decoding data  and on digital certificate technology  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the strongest and most secure cryptographic protection available  and thereby may expose us or our customers to a risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our or our customers operations 
any compromise or elimination of our security could result in risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and reduce demand for our products and services 
if we are not able to continue to include our public root keys within software applications  our customers may not use our services 
if we are not able to continue to include our public root keys within software applications  including microsoft windows  the microsoft internet explorer browser and the netscape browser  customers might perceive our software products as too cumbersome to use and our business may be harmed 
our public root keys are used by applications to insure that digitally signed objects which are generated by our enterprise va and digital receipt solutions are trustworthy and have not been tampered with or corrupted 
the term of our root key agreement with netscape ends in november and we cannot assure you that this agreement will be renewed 
in addition  our root key agreement with microsoft may not be extended to cover subsequent releases of microsoft windows or the microsoft internet explorer browser 
the covenants and restrictions in our existing and future debt facilities could have a negative effect on our business 
the covenants and restrictions in our existing and future debt instruments could have a negative effect on our business  including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing and reducing our operational flexibility and ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
in addition  any failure to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our million line of credit agreement or any other credit facility would generally result in a default under the facility  permitting the lenders to declare all debt outstanding under that facility to be immediately due and payable 
further  a default under any debt facility could  under cross default provisions  result in defaults under other debt instruments  entitling other lenders to declare all debt outstanding under those other facilities to be immediately due and payable 
if any declaration of acceleration were to occur  we might be unable to make those required payments or to raise sufficient funds from other sources to make those payments 
in addition  we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our credit facilities 
if a default occurs with respect to secured indebtedness  the holders of that indebtedness would be entitled to foreclose on their collateral  which would harm our business 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products and services 
any disruption to a customer s website or application caused by our products or services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims 
our insurer may also disclaim coverage as to any claims  which could result in substantial costs to us 
we have been named as a defendant in a stockholder class action lawsuit that is now pending and which arose out of our public offering of securities in if we do not prevail in this lawsuit  our business may suffer 
a class action lawsuit was filed on december  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of purchasers of valicert common stock alleging violations of federal securities laws 
lachance v 
valicert  inc et al  no 
cv sas sdny  related to in re initial public offerings securities litigation  no 
mc sas 
the case is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from july  through december  the complaint names as defendants the company  joseph yosi amram  president  chief executive officer  and member of the board of directors  timothy conley  vice president  finance and chief financial officer  and an investment banking firm that served as an underwriter for the our initial public offering in july the complaint alleges violations of section and of the securities act of against all defendants  and section b of the securities exchange act of against the underwriter  on the grounds that the prospectus incorporated in the registration statement for the offering failed to disclose  among other things  that i the underwriter had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors in exchange for which the underwriter allocated to those investors material portions of the shares of our stock sold in the initial public offering  and ii the underwriter had entered into agreements with customers whereby the underwriter agreed to allocate shares of our stock sold in the initial public offering to those customers in exchange for which the customers agreed to purchase additional shares of our stock in the aftermarket at pre determined prices 
no specific damages are claimed 
we believe that the allegations are without merit and we intend to contest them vigorously 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will prevail in this lawsuit 
failure to prevail could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
in addition  we may become subject to other types of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and divertsmanagement s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
additional government regulation relating to the internet may increase our costs of doing business 
we are subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to companies utilizing the internet 
although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet 
these laws could cover issues like user privacy  pricing  content  intellectual property  distribution  antitrust  legal liability and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations could decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise could harm our business or prospects 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues like property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
for example  tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce 
new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes 
any new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could harm our ability to conduct business and our operating results 
our reported results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap is subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results  and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed prior to the announcement of a change 
risks related to our industry the markets for secure online transaction products and services generally  and our products and services specifically  are new and may not develop  which would harm our business 
the market for our products and services is new and evolving rapidly 
if the market for our products and services fails to develop and grow  or if our products and services do not gain broad market acceptance  our business and prospects will be harmed 
in particular  our success will depend upon the adoption and use by current and potential customers and their end users of secure online transaction products and services 
our success will also depend upon acceptance of our technology as the standard for providing these products and services 
the adoption and use of our products and services will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally completed transactions 
we cannot predict whether our products and services will achieve any market acceptance 
our ability to achieve our goals also depends upon rapid market acceptance of future enhancements of our products 
any enhancement that is not favorably received by customers and end users may not be profitable and  furthermore  could damage our reputation or brand name 
the intense competition in our industry could reduce our market share or eliminate the demand for our software products and services  which could harm our business 
competition in the security infrastructure market is intense 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our ability to increase our market share and revenue will be harmed 
we compete with companies that provide individual products and services that are similar to certain aspects of our software products and services 
certificate authority software vendors and vendors of other security products and services could enter the market and provide end to end solutions which might be more comprehensive than our solutions 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
we anticipate that the market for security products and services that enable valid  secure and provable electronic commerce and communications over the internet will remain intensely competitive 
we expect that competition will increase in the near term and increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins or the failure of our internet based security products and services to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could materially harm our business 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish collaborative relationships among themselves or with third parties  including third parties with whom we have strategic alliances  to increase the ability of their products to address the security needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
if this were to occur  our business could be materially affected 
our business depends on the wide adoption of the internet for conducting electronic commerce 
in order for us to be successful  the internet must be widely adopted as a medium for conducting electronic commerce 
because electronic commerce over the internet is new and evolving  it is difficult to predict the size of this market and its sustainable growth rate 
to date  many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the internet for a number of reasons  including but not limited to potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure  security concerns including the potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over the internet  inconsistent quality of service  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  limited numbers of local access points for corporate users  inability to integrate business applications on the internet  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products  and a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of the internet 
the adoption of the internet will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
companies and government agencies that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods 
also  individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be reluctant to change 
the use of the internet may not increase or may increase more slowly than we expect because the infrastructure required to support widespread use may not develop 
the internet may continue to experience significant growth both in the number of users and the level of use 
however  the internet infrastructure may not be able to continue to support the demands placed on it by continued growth 
continued growth may also affect the internet s performance and reliability 
in addition  the growth and reliability of the internet could be harmed by delays in development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity or by increased governmental regulation 
changes in  or insufficient availability of  communications services to support the internet could result in poor performance and adversely affect its usage 
any of these factors could materially harm our business 
public key cryptography security  on which our products and services are based  may become obsolete  which would harm our business 
the technology used to keep private keys confidential depends in part on the application of mathematical principles and relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime number components 
should a simpler factoring method be developed  then the security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology could be reduced or eliminated 
even if no breakthroughs in factoring or other methods of attacking cryptographic systems are made  factoring problems can theoretically be solved by computer systems significantly faster and more powerful than those presently available 
any significant advance in techniques for attacking cryptographic systems could render some or all of our existing products and services obsolete or unmarketable 
security systems based on public key cryptography assign users a public key and a private key  each of which is required to encrypt and decrypt data 
the security afforded by this technology depends on the user s key remaining confidential 
it is therefore critical that the private key be kept secure 
our products are subject to export controls 
if we are unable to obtain necessary approvals  our ability to make international sales could be limited 
exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the united states and various foreign governments 
cryptographic products typically require export licenses from united states government agencies 
we are currently exporting software products and services with requisite export approval under united states law 
however  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the related regulatory policies  could be revised beyond their current scope  and we may not be able to obtain necessary approval for the export of our products 
our inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could limit our ability to make international sales 
furthermore  our competitors may also seek to obtain approvals to export products that could increase the amount of competition we face 
risks related to the stock market in general our stock price may decline due to market and economic factors 
in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of small capitalization and technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations unrelated to our performance 
such fluctuations could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership 
we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have right prior to those of our common stock 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
previous in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
we are controlled by our executive officers  directors and major stockholders  whose interests may conflict with yours 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
in addition  provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america  europe and asia pacific regions 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
because substantially all of our revenues are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments  including money market funds and commercial paper  and long term investments mature between one and two years 
our interest expense is also sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates because the interest rate charged on a portion of our long term debt varies with the prime rate 
due to the nature of our investments and borrowings  we believe that we are not subject to any material exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points would have an immaterial effect on our operating results and cash flows 
as of december   we have not entered into any derivative contracts  either for hedging or trading purposes
