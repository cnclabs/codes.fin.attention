item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
references to we  us or our refer to visual networks  inc on a consolidated basis 
overview from our incorporation in august through december  our principal objective was to secure sufficient equity financing to enable us to accelerate product development efforts of visual uptime for frame relay deployment and create the infrastructure necessary to support these efforts 
we first shipped visual uptime in mid and began generating significant revenue during since our inception  we have focused on establishing relationships with service providers with the goal of having these service providers include our products into their infrastructure or in their service offerings to their subscribers 
consistent with this goal  we have established agreements with at t  equant  sprint and worldcom 
during  and  we continued to focus on selling visual uptime and added to our product portfolio as a result of a series of acquisitions the netnet product  cell tracer  in  the inverse products  visual ip insight and visual internet benchmark  in  and the avesta products  visual trinity and visual ewatcher  in during  we discontinued development and sales efforts of visual trinity and sold the visual internet benchmark product 
during  we also made a decision to combine certain functionality of the web performance management technology of the visual ewatcher product with the visual ip insight product 
development efforts relating to incorporating this functionality are expected to begin in and be included in a future release of the visual ip insight product in we continue to focus on sales of visual uptime  visual ip insight and cell tracer 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the estimates included in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounts receivable allowances  inventory reserves  estimates of expense accruals and the cash flow estimates used in evaluating impairment of long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
our significant accounting policies are described fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and the impairment of long lived assets are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we recognize revenue from our service management products and services including hardware  software  benchmark services  professional services and technical support 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale or license of our products upon delivery and passage of title to the customer 
where agreements provide for evaluation or customer acceptance  we recognize revenue upon the completion of the evaluation process and acceptance of the product by the customer 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method whereby the fair value of any undelivered elements  such as customer support and services  is deferred and any residual value is allocated to the software and recognized as revenue upon delivery and passage of title 
the fair values of professional services  technical support and training have been determined based on our specific objective evidence of fair value 
our maintenance contracts require us to provide technical support and software updates to customers 
we recognize technical support revenue  including maintenance revenue that is bundled with product sales  ratably over the term of the contract period  which generally ranges from one to five years 
we recognize revenue from services when the services are performed 
subscription fees for our benchmark reports are recognized upon delivery of the reports 
while substantially all of our product sales to date have been made to customers in the united states  we plan to sell our products to foreign customers at prices denominated in us dollars 
however  if we commence selling material volumes of product to such customers at prices not denominated in us dollars  we intend to adopt a strategy to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency 
with the acquisition of avesta in may  we allowed our business strategy to become less focused  which increased the complexity of our business and adversely affected our results of operations 
our revenue decreased from million in to million in while our operating expenses increased resulting in significant losses from operations 
our historical trend of increasing revenue each quarter began to reverse in the second quarter of these revenue decreases were due to lower than expected revenue related to the visual trinity and visual ewatcher products the products added through the avesta acquisition as well as decreases in the revenue provided by our other products 
despite these revenue decreases  our operating expenses increased significantly in the corresponding periods due  in large part  to the addition of the avesta operations 
in an attempt to refocus our efforts  we announced a plan in the fourth quarter of to realign our product portfolio  streamline our operations and devote resources to the markets and products that offer us the greatest growth opportunities 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we discontinued development and sales efforts on the visual trinity product and sold the visual internet benchmark product in an effort to further focus our product portfolio and streamline our operations and resources 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a workforce reduction to continue focusing on reducing our operating expenses 
in connection with these efforts  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the second quarter of and  in the fourth quarter of in determining the carrying amount of our long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
if future estimated undiscounted net cash flows are more likely than not to be less than the carrying amount of the long lived assets  then such assets are written down to their fair value 
due to the significance of the developments in  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 including those assets related to the avesta acquisition 
based upon this evaluation  we concluded that the remaining values of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to the avesta acquisition were impaired 
this conclusion was based upon our revised estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be provided by the avesta operations 
the estimate of such cash flows was substantially less than the carrying values of the related long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge included million related to goodwill  which represented the entire remaining unamortized balance  and million related to the other acquired intangibles including the completed technology  the assembled workforce and the trademarks and tradenames 
in the second quarter of  we announced a decision to discontinue development and sales efforts on the visual trinity product 
in the fourth quarter of  we also made a decision to combine certain functionality of the web performance management technology of the visual ewatcher product with the visual ip insight product 
as a result of these decisions  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets  including those related to the avesta acquisition and concluded that the remaining intangibles were impaired as the visual trinity product and the visual ewatcher product were the only products acquired with avesta 
we recorded impairment charges of million in the second quarter of and  in the fourth quarter of related to the remaining intangibles from the avesta acquisition 
during  our revenue decreased from million in to million in this revenue decrease during was due  in part  to the discontinuation of the visual trinity product and the sale of the visual internet benchmark product as well as decreases in all of our other product lines 
in response to these revenue decreases  we focused on implementing our comprehensive plan to strengthen our business by x strengthening our product portfolio we released visual uptime and visual ip insight and eliminated visual trinity and visual internet benchmark  x strengthening our senior management team during  elton king was hired as president and chief executive officer and in january  john saunders became our chief financial officer  x concentrating our sales  marketing  research and product development initiatives around service providers and their end user customers we established a new service provider relationship with equant for ip vpn services worldwide and increased our total revenue from service providers  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in  and x reducing our operating expenses we reduced our workforce by approximately people since october  closed our facilities in ottawa  canada  sunnyvale  california  and new york  new york  and reduced our facilities in rockville  md  resulting in a reduction in operating expenses excluding charges related to acquisitions and restructuring and impairment  from million in to million in results of operations the following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of our revenue years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development write off of purchased research and development sales and marketing general and administrative merger related costs restructuring and impairment charges amortization of goodwill and other intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net net income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss the following table presents the revenue by product in thousands years ended december  visual uptime    visual cell tracer    visual ip insight    continuing product revenue    visual internet benchmark    visual trinity and ewatcher   discontinued product revenue    total revenue    compared with revenue 
revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the overall decrease in revenue of was primarily due to a decrease in visual cell tracer revenue of million  from one customer  a decrease in visual uptime revenue of million  primarily from value added resellers and service providers  a decrease in visual ip insight revenue of million and a decrease in visual trinity revenue of million as a result of the discontinuation of the product 
the decrease in cell tracer revenue was attributable to reduced demand from our sole customer for the product 
the decrease in sales of visual uptime was primarily attributable to a decrease in purchases from one of our major service provider customers 
sales to all service providers increased from approximately of revenue for to for as a result of the discontinuation of the visual trinity product  we anticipate that future revenue for the product will consist primarily of technical support revenue  all of which is currently included in deferred revenue 
we plan to provide technical support for the visual trinity product through september we will continue to recognize revenue from the visual internet benchmark product that we sold during  for existing contracts  under which we are still required to perform services 
we receive royalty payments from the purchaser on new contracts 
gross profit 
cost of revenue consists of subcontracting costs  component parts  direct compensation costs  communication costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees and other overhead expenses related to manufacturing operations and support of our software products and benchmark services 
gross profit was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
gross margin was of revenue for as compared to of revenue for the decrease in gross margin percentage was due primarily to significant fixed manufacturing and other costs supporting a lower revenue base  fewer high margin software sales primarily due to the discontinuation of the visual trinity product and higher fixed costs to support the visual benchmark service for existing contracts 
our future gross margins may be affected by a number of factors  including product mix  the proportion of sales to service providers  competitive pricing  manufacturing volumes and an increase in the cost of component parts 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of compensation for research and development staff  depreciation of test and development equipment  certain software development costs and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expense was million for compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to workforce reductions and facility closures during and research and development expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
we intend to incur research and development expenses at a level consistent with the fourth quarter of or decrease them in absolute dollars during as a result of our continued focus on the reduction of operating expenses 
write off of purchased research and development 
a write off of purchased research and development costs of million was recorded in in connection with the acquisition of avesta  avesta had in process technology which represented research and development projects of avesta that had not reached technological feasibility and that had no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
we must charge to expenses as of the date of the acquisition date amounts assigned to in process research and development ipr d meeting the foregoing 
the evaluated projects were future releases of the trinity  ewatcher and other products 
the products in process included both upgrades to existing products as well as major modifications for future releases 
additional products that had been started but not yet assigned a numerical designation and were considered to be only complete were excluded from the evaluation 
the trinity related projects represented the majority of the value assigned to the ipr d projects 
we valued the acquired ipr d based upon an independent appraisal 
the values of the ipr d projects were determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects  once commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows back to their present values and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values to reflect the uncertainty of technical success of the projects 
the rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present values were based on avesta s weighted average cost of capital 
the percentage of completion was based on management s estimates of the amount of resources spent to date and on the expected use of future resources 
as of the valuation date  avesta was offering version of the trinity product 
versions  and were considered ipr d projects and were estimated to be  and complete  respectively 
the ewatcher product had been acquired by avesta in and versions and were considered ipr d projects and were estimated to be and complete  respectively 
certain risks and uncertainties are associated with the completion of the development of these products within a reasonable projected period of time 
each of the acquired ipr d projects had not demonstrated technological feasibility as of the acquisition date 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists of compensation for the sales and marketing staff  commissions  pre sales support  travel and entertainment expense  trade shows and other marketing programs 
sales and marketing expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to workforce reductions during and sales and marketing expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
we intend to incur sales and marketing expenses at a level consistent with the fourth quarter of or decrease them in absolute dollars during as a result of our continued focus on the reduction of operating expenses 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists of the costs of executive management  finance  administration  and other activities 
general and administrative expense was million for compared with million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was due primarily to workforce reductions and facility closures during and general and administrative expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
we intend to incur general and administrative expenses at a level consistent with the fourth quarter of or decrease them in absolute dollars during as a result of our continued focus on the reduction of operating expenses 
restructuring and impairment charges 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of facilities in ottawa  canada and sunnyvale  california and the reduction in size of our facilities in rockville  maryland and new york  new york 
during the second quarter of  we reversed  of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of due primarily to lower than estimated costs related to facility closure costs 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of our new york  new york facility following our announcement to discontinue the visual trinity product 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of due to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures and other contractual obligations 
we recorded another restructuring charge of  in the fourth quarter of that consisted of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately people resulting from our continued focus on the reduction of our operating expenses 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of for the write off of goodwill and other intangibles related to the avesta acquisition 
we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the second quarter of as a result of our discontinuation of the visual trinity product 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the impairment of an investment acquired with the avesta acquisition and the write off of the remaining intangible assets related to the avesta acquisition as a result of our plans for the ewatcher product see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in related to the avesta acquisition compared with  in the decrease was the result of decreased goodwill and intangibles resulting from the impairment charges recorded in and interest income  net 
interest income  net  was million for compared to  for the decrease of million was primarily due to decreased cash balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was  and related primarily to state income taxes and other non recoverable income tax payments 
net loss 
net loss for was million as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges  amortization of intangibles and operating expenses  offset in part by decreases in revenue  gross profit  interest income and income tax benefits 
compared with revenue 
we recognized million in revenue for compared to million in revenue for  a decrease 
the decline was due primarily to a decrease in visual uptime revenue of million  primarily from service providers  offset by increases in revenue related to visual cell tracer  visual ip insight and visual internet benchmark and the effect of the acquisition of the avesta trinity and ewatcher products 
the decrease in sales of visual uptime was primarily attributable to a change in purchasing behavior of two major service providers 
sales to all service providers accounted for approximately of revenue for as compared to for gross profit 
gross profit was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
gross margin was of revenue for compared to of revenue for the decrease in gross margin percentage was due primarily to higher fixed costs supporting a lower revenue base and approximately million in inventory write downs offset  in part  by the addition of higher margin software sales of visual trinity and visual ewatcher 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to the costs of the avesta research and development staff subsequent to the date of acquisition  increased staffing levels and related support costs  and purchases of materials and services used in the development of new or enhanced products 
research and development expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
write off of purchased research and development 
a write off of purchased research and development costs of million was recorded in in connection with the acquisition of avesta  as described above 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million for compared to million for an increase of million 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to the costs of avesta sales and marketing staff and programs subsequent to the date of acquisition and continued growth in staffing  commissions and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to the additional costs of the avesta staff and professional services incurred subsequent to the date of acquisition and increased staffing  professional services and corporate facilities and network infrastructure costs 
general and administrative expense was and revenue for and  respectively 
restructuring and impairment charges 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of facilities in ottawa  canada and sunnyvale  california and the reduction in size of our facilities in rockville  maryland and new york  new york 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of goodwill and other intangibles related to the avesta acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the avesta acquisition in interest income  net 
interest income  net  for was approximately million as compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due to decreased interest expense related to capital leases and other borrowings 
income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for was million 
the effective tax rate of differed from the statutory rates primarily due to the income tax effect of the avesta acquisition and increases in the valuation allowance 
net income loss 
net loss for was million for as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the decrease was due primarily to decreases in revenue and gross profit  increased operating expenses  the write off of purchased research and development  the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and the restructuring and impairment charges 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our unrestricted cash balance was million compared to million as of december   a decrease million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to cash used in operations  due to operating losses as well as the payment of certain restructuring charges recorded in net cash used in operating activities in was million 
during the year  we also used cash of  to purchase equipment and other fixed assets  and we made principal payments on capital lease obligations of  cash provided by the maturities of short term investments was million  the sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan was million  and net borrowings from our bank were million 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories  accounts receivable  research and development activities and capital expenditures as well as to fund our operating losses 
to date  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february and from our operating income generated through the first quarter of in  as indicated above  we became dependent on cash that was provided by our bank under a credit facility 
in addition  from time to time  we have obtained advance payments in connection with certain customer purchase orders 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an advance payment of approximately million that was classified as a customer deposit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   the related customer orders were fulfilled in february we do not anticipate receiving customer advance payments in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  as well as our gross margin and our levels of operating expenses  including product research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
in response to the trends of decreasing revenue and increasing operating expenses  we initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of to realign our product portfolio  streamline our operations and devote resources to the markets and products that we believe have the greatest opportunity for growth 
in the second quarter of  we announced a plan to discontinue development and sales efforts on the visual trinity product and eliminate the related costs 
in the fourth quarter of  we made additional reductions in workforce and other operating costs 
as a result of these actions  operating expenses  excluding charges related to acquisitions and restructuring and impairment charges  have been reduced from a level of million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of although our revenue for the fourth quarter of was million compared to revenue of million in the comparable period of last year  our fourth quarter revenue decreased from million and million for the quarters ended september  and june   respectively 
revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our ability to generate operating income in the future is dependent upon not only our continued success in reducing operating expenses  but also our ability to sustain revenue 
general market conditions  competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to enable us to become profitable 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to sustain revenue or become profitable 
in the event that the anticipated cost reductions are not realized or we do not meet our revenue goals  we may be required to further reduce our cost structure 
the significant operating losses incurred by us since the third quarter of have resulted in a significant reduction in our cash 
our balance of cash and cash equivalents has decreased from million at december  to million at december  accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaled million at december   and current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately million 
in order to strengthen our financial position and provide cash for working capital purposes  in march  we issued senior secured convertible debentures in the aggregate amount of million in a private placement offering 
the debentures are due march   payable in common stock or cash at our option provided certain conditions are satisfied  bear interest at an annual rate of payable quarterly  and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
the debentures may be converted into our common stock at the option of the holders at a price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the debentures are convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to the principal amount of the debentures divided by the conversion price  or  shares on the date of issuance 
we are required to adjust the conversion price if we issue certain additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into common stock at a price that is less than the conversion price of the debentures 
we have the right to require the holders to convert their debentures into common stock if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for consecutive days after september  the debentures include certain financial covenants related to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for and if the financial covenants are not met  the holders may cause us to redeem the debentures at a price equal to the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest 
the redemption may be made in cash or common stock at our option subject to certain conditions 
redemption of the debentures also may be required upon a specified change of control or upon the occurrence of any one of the other triggering events including  but not limited to  our default on other indebtedness  our failure to register the shares of common stock that may be issued to the debenture holders and our failure to maintain our common stock listing on an eligible market 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the exercise price may be adjusted if we issue certain additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into common stock at a lower price than the initial exercise price 
the warrants expire on march  the debentures also give the holders the right to purchase shares of to be created series a preferred stock for million prior to may  the series a preferred stock will accrue dividends at an annual rate of that are payable quarterly beginning on june  we will have the right to cause the redemption of the series a preferred stock on the fourth anniversary of the issuance of such stock based on similar terms to the debentures 
we have also granted to the debenture holders the right to purchase million of additional shares of to be created preferred stock at any time after the six month anniversary but before the fifteen month anniversary of the issuance of the debentures 
the debenture holders were also granted certain equity participation and registration rights 
in connection with the issuance of the debentures  the outstanding amounts borrowed from the bank under our accounts receivable based and our equipment financing arrangements were repaid  and the related loan agreements were terminated 
the standby letter of credit  as amended  issued by the bank in december in the amount of million with an expiration date of september  remains outstanding and secured with our pledge of a certificate of deposit in the amount of million that matures on october  the future success of our company will be dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to generate adequate cash for operating and capital needs 
we are relying on our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures discussed above together with future sales and the collection of the related accounts receivable to meet our future cash requirements 
if cash provided by these sources is not sufficient  we will be required to further reduce our expenditures for operations or to seek additional capital through other means that may include the sale of assets  the sale of equity securities or additional borrowings 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available  or available on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us 
if we are unable to generate additional cash  our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected such that we may need to consider other alternatives for our future 
additional risk factors in addition to the other information provided or incorporated by reference in this document  stockholders should also consider the following factors carefully in evaluating whether to make an investment decision 
stockholders should also refer to the section entitled forward looking statements 
we have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit and we may not be profitable in the future 
our limited history  operating losses and accumulated deficit make predicting our future operating results difficult 
our company was organized in and we introduced visual uptime in mid visual ip insight was introduced in accordingly  we have only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our products and prospects can be based 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we reported net income of million for  we have incurred consolidated net losses in the years ended december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
the loss in related to the year end write down of impaired intangible assets recorded in the avesta acquisition  the write off of purchased research and development related to the avesta acquisition  the amortization of the acquired intangibles including goodwill prior to the write down  the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter as well as reduced revenue and increased operating expenses 
the loss in was due to a reduction in revenue as well as the write off of the remaining intangible assets related to the avesta acquisition  restructuring charges recorded in the second and fourth quarters  and the write off of an investment 
while we believe that our restructuring activities and new product strategies will result in sufficient revenue and reduced operating expenses compared to such that we will return to profitability in  there can be no assurances that we will become profitable 
failure to achieve expected revenue levels may adversely affect future operating results 
our revenue in any period depends primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the period  which are difficult to predict 
our expense levels are based  in part  on the expectation of future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations due to delays associated with customers decision making processes or for any other reason  operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected 
results of operations may be affected disproportionately by a reduction in revenue because a large portion of our expenses are fixed and cannot be easily reduced without adversely affecting our business 
in addition  we currently intend to sustain funding of research and product development efforts and sales  marketing and customer support operations and to expand distribution channels 
to the extent such expenses precede or are not promptly followed by increased revenue  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the loss of at t  worldcom or sprint as customers could harm our business 
our primary sales and marketing strategy depends predominantly on sales to service providers 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue in will be attributable to sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight to service providers 
the loss of any one of at t  worldcom or sprint  which together have historically provided a majority of our revenue  would result in a substantial loss of revenue that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for  at t  worldcom and sprint accounted for  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
this concentration should continue as our customer base will consist predominantly of service providers 
existing service provider customers are not easily replaced because of the relatively few participants in that market 
high barriers to entry due to extraordinary capital requirements and the likelihood that mergers of existing service providers may further reduce their number mean that replacing a significant network provider company customer will be even more difficult in the future 
furthermore  the small number of customers means that the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of our products to any one service provider customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our anticipated dependence on sizable orders from a limited number of service providers will make the relationship between us and each service provider critically important to our business 
as our relationships with these service providers evolve over time  we will make adjustments to product specifications  forecasts and delivery timetables in response to service provider demands and expectations 
further  because none of our agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  there can be no assurance that the issuance of a purchase order will result in significant recurring business 
any inability to manage our service provider relationships successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure of service providers to incorporate our products into their infrastructure may adversely affect the level of future revenue 
our service provider deployment strategy depends on the sale of visual uptime and visual ip insight to service providers for their own network infrastructures 
however  capital expenditures by service providers have decreased as they attempt to recover from the deep and sudden decline in the telecommunications markets 
the success of our strategy in will depend  in part  on our ability to demonstrate that our product solutions reduce service provider operating expenses and enable the creation of new revenue generating services 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in demonstrating the value of our products to service providers 
if we are unsuccessful  our future revenue could be significantly lower than anticipated 
we believe that the success of the service provider deployment strategy depends on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including acceptance of and satisfaction with our systems by service providers and their customers  our ability to convince the service providers of the operational benefits of visual uptime and visual ip insight  the realization of operating cost efficiencies by service providers and their customers upon the deployment of visual uptime and visual ip insight  the demand generation for these systems from customers and support for the systems by the service provider sales forces  the competitive dynamics between service providers that provide communication networks for wide area use and the development of service for new world networks overall  our successful development of systems and products that address the requirements for systems deployed as part of a service provider s infrastructure  the timing and successful completion of integration development work by service providers to incorporate our service management functionality into their operational infrastructure  and the absence of new technologies that make our products and systems obsolete before they become standardized in network systems 
the failure of our products to become an accepted part of the service providers infrastructures or a slower than expected increase in the volume of sales by us to these companies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our long sales cycle requires us to expend significant resources on potential sales opportunities that may never be consummated 
if we do not generate additional revenue from our sales and marketing efforts  the expended resources and lack of increased revenue could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future business prospects depend on growing the sales of our products and services 
the incorporation of our products into the infrastructure of service providers is characterized by a long sales cycle to turn opportunities into sales 
the risks inherent in the long sales cycle for visual uptime and visual ip insight  over which we have little or no control over  include service providers internal acceptance reviews  service providers budgetary constraints and technology assessment  service providers lengthy decision making processes  the attendant delays frequently associated with service providers internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  and the substantial commitment of capital from service providers 
sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight generally involve significant testing by and education of both service providers and their customers as well as a substantial commitment of our sales and marketing resources 
as a result  we may expend significant resources pursuing potential sales opportunities that will not be consummated 
even if service providers do deploy our products  the curtailment or termination of service provider marketing programs  the reduction in demand by service provider customers  decreases in service provider capital budgets or the reduction in the purchasing priority assigned to our products  particularly if significant and unanticipated by us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an unanticipated interruption or delay in the scheduled receipt of products from our subcontract manufacturer could reduce revenue 
we have outsourced the manufacture of substantially all of our ase units the analysis service element of our visual uptime system to a single subcontract manufacturing firm 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of these units 
our ability to meet the delivery dates requested by customers depends on the timely supply of such products from the subcontract manufacturer 
our bank has issued an irrevocable letter of credit on their behalf in the amount of million that expires on september  this letter of credit mitigates  but does not eliminate entirely  the credit and inventory risk for the supplier 
the withdrawal of the letter of credit by the bank or our inability to obtain an extension to its current expiration date  if required by the subcontract manufacturer  could harm our business 
similarly  a decision by the subcontract manufacturer to reduce or eliminate the amount of credit extended to us or to stop the shipment of products due to concerns about our financial condition or the amount of their credit and inventory risk could harm our business 
any resulting interruption or delay in the supply of our products by the subcontract manufacturer could result in a loss of revenue 
failure of the market to accept new world network services would reduce the demand for our products 
because our systems are deployed predominantly on new world networks such as frame relay  atm  ip  remote access and vpns  our near term success will depend on the continued market acceptance of these technologies as preferred networking solutions 
if these services do not maintain widespread market acceptance  the market for our products will be substantially reduced which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we are currently devoting significant resources to the development of additional products  there can be no assurance that we will complete the development of these or any future products in a timely fashion  that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products  that our future products will achieve market acceptance or  if market acceptance is achieved  that we will be able to maintain such acceptance for a significant period of time 
if we are unable to develop products on a timely basis that address changing customer needs and technologies  we may lose market share to competitors or be required to substantially increase development expenditures 
such an unanticipated increase in research and development expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there also can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
failure of broadband access services to achieve significant market penetration could impact the effectiveness of our new product strategy 
our new product strategy anticipates that customers will provide comprehensive service management for the new world networks running over broadband access facilities such as dsl  fixed wireless  and cable 
there is no assurance that these access technologies will achieve broad based market acceptance for mission critical applications for the business customers of the service providers 
failure of these technologies to achieve broad based market acceptance could adversely affect future revenue  financial condition  and results of operations 
failure of businesses to use the internet for corporate networking purposes would reduce the demand for our products 
because our service management products and services are based on providing performance measurement and diagnostics for the internet and corporate ip networks  the internet must be widely adopted  in a timely manner  as a means of electronic commerce  or e commerce  and communications 
if such adoption should not occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because e commerce and communications over the internet are new and evolving  it is difficult to predict the size of this market and its sustainable growth rate 
in addition  we believe that the use of the internet for conducting business transactions could be hindered for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to security concerns including the potential for fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over the internet  inconsistent quality of service  including well publicized outages of popular web sites  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  limited numbers of local access points for corporate users  delay in the development of enabling technologies or adoption of new standards  inability to integrate business applications with the internet  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products  and a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of the internet 
improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could reduce or eliminate demand for our internet performance measurement products and services 
the demand for our service management products and services could be reduced or eliminated if future improvements to the infrastructure of the internet lead companies to conclude that measuring and evaluating the performance of their networks is no longer important to their business 
the internet is a complex  heterogeneous network of communications networks with multiple operators and vendors supplying and managing the underlying infrastructure as well as connections to this infrastructure 
because the inherent complexity of the internet currently causes significant e commerce quality of service problems for companies  the vendors and operators that supply and manage the underlying infrastructure are continuously seeking to improve the speed  availability  reliability and consistency of the internet 
if these vendors and operators succeed in significantly improving the performance of the internet  which would result in corresponding improvements in the performance of companies networks  demand for our products and services would likely decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to adapt to rapid technological change could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes  including continuing advances in technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and preferences and changes in industry standards 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely fashion that accommodate future changes  we will likely lose customers and business which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of new technologies or advances in techniques for network services or the integration of service level management functionality into other network hardware components could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that i our existing products will continue to compete successfully  ii our future product offerings will keep pace with the technological changes implemented by our competitors  iii our products will satisfy evolving industry standards or preferences of existing or prospective customers  or iv we will be successful in developing and marketing products for any future technology 
failure to achieve any one of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face growing competition that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
the market for service management systems for new world connectivity services is new and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition in this market to intensify in the future 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
many of these competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us  and some have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively than us  or devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of products 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience competition from less expensive products and services that provide only a portion of the functionality provided by our products and services 
in particular  as prices for network equipment components such as data service units channel service units decrease  customers may decide to purchase these less expensive products even though they lack certain features offered by our products  particularly when these units are integrated in customer routers and switches 
for example  we expect that participants with strong capabilities in these various segments could partner with each other to offer products that supply functionality approaching that provided by visual uptime 
the success of such products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we expand the scope of our products and services  we may encounter many additional  market specific competitors 
these potential competitors include large companies that sell network management software 
the success of such products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in a lengthened sales cycle 
many companies in the telecommunications industry  particularly internet service providers  dsl providers and competitive local exchange carriers  are consolidating with each other 
as a result  the managements of these companies may be more focused on internal integration and other integration issues and less focused on the purchasing of additional equipment and services for service creation 
this is likely to affect our business by lengthening our sales cycle  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the pending break up of at t could lengthen sales cycles and adversely affect our business 
potential disruption caused by the pending break up of at t could result in delays by at t s customers in ordering services based on our equipment and delays in installation of services by at t 
both of these conditions could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the separation by at t of its business unit  broadband unit and wireless unit into three different companies could impact adversely the potential synergies realized from integrated service management across multiple broadband access technologies  resulting in a reduction in the demand for our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
errors in our products or services could discourage customers and damage our reputation 
if our existing or future products or services contain errors that are not detected before shipment  we could experience a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation or increases in service or warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
products and services as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products and services until commercial shipments have commenced 
our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers makes the price we pay for important components in our products more volatile 
many key components used in the manufacture of our products are purchased only from sole or limited sources 
if a sole or limited source supplier raises their prices  delays shipments or becomes unable or unwilling to supply a key component  we may be forced to obtain these components from alternative sources if they are available  which could impair our ability to deliver our products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner  or could force us to increase our prices or reduce our gross profit margins 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and could jeopardize our relationships with those customers 
the risks associated with being dependant on sole or limited source suppliers of key components include the following we have not identified alternative suppliers for all of our key components and we may not be able to find alternative suppliers  if necessary  or find alternative components of comparable quality  we will have to qualify alternative suppliers before components are purchased from them which will  even if successful  necessarily delay the process of procuring the replacement components  most of our suppliers do not have long term agreements with us  so these suppliers could suddenly increase component prices  even minor delays in shipments of key components from suppliers  which we have experienced in the past  could delay the shipment of our products  although all of our sole or limited source suppliers are based in the united states  some of them may manufacture or acquire components from outside of the united states and thus they may be unable to deliver their components if their own supplies are interrupted by events in other countries  and some of the components  including dynamic random access memories and embedded communications processors  are subject to significant price fluctuations 
sole source components presently include framers  certain semiconductors  embedded communications processors  communication controllers and line interface components 
claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights may harm our business 
if others claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  whether the claims are valid or not  we may be forced to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products or acquire licenses to the claimant s intellectual property 
we expect that these claims may become more common as the number of products in the network management industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps 
if a claimant is successful in a lawsuit arising from such a claim  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to protect our own intellectual property rights may harm our business 
our success is dependent on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we currently hold four united states patents and one foreign patent  and also rely on copyright and trade secret laws  trademarks  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary software  documentation and other proprietary information 
these protection methods may not be adequate to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors that develop functionally equivalent technology 
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  regardless of its success or failure  could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
we may be subject to additional risk as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or enforced effectively 
legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries  and technology developed or used in such countries may not be protected in jurisdictions where protection is ordinarily available 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key people could jeopardize our growth prospects 
the loss of the services of elton king  our president and chief executive officer  steven hindman  our executive vice president  sales and marketing  or john saunders  our chief financial officer  or any other key employee could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management and technical employees  particularly messrs 
king  hindman and saunders 
our inability to recruit and retain employees may hurt our growth prospects 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  customer support and product development personnel 
intense competition for technically trained sales and product development personnel makes recruiting and keeping qualified personnel difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to attract and retain skilled employees 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our defense of the litigation relating to our alleged false and misleading statements may result in costly litigation  divert the efforts and attention of our management  and be unsuccessful 
we are defending ourselves against the claims discussed in item legal proceedings 
we believe that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and we intend to defend this case vigorously 
we may  however  incur significant legal costs related to this litigation 
we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this action and the effects  if any  on our financial statements 
a negative outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to prevail in the shareholder s suit could result in the payment of substantial damages and the reimbursement of plaintiffs legal costs 
we may face difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with any future acquisitions 
we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with channel partners of our products and services and our customers  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition 
our failure to successfully assimilate companies or technologies acquired by us or the occurrence of unanticipated costs that may arise in connection with such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have anti takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws make it more difficult for another individual or company to acquire control of our company  even if a change of control would benefit our stockholders 
these terms include our board of directors  without stockholder approval  may issue up to  shares of preferred stock on terms that they determine 
this preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms that delay or prevent the change in control of our company  make removal of management more difficult or depress the price of our stock  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner  our board of directors is staggered so that only a portion of its members are elected each year  only our board of directors  our chairman of the board  our president or stockholders holding a majority of our stock can call special stockholder meetings  and special procedures must be followed in order for stockholders to present proposals at stockholder meetings 
in addition  our credit facility with silicon valley bank prohibits us from engaging in a merger with or being acquired by another entity without their consent  unless we are the surviving entity and the transaction does not otherwise create an event of default 
risks pertaining to arthur andersen llp our access to capital markets and timely financial reporting may be impaired if we need to engage a new independent public accounting firm 
on march   our independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron 
arthur andersen has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously the indictment 
the sec has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  and interim financial statements reviewed by it  so long as arthur andersen is able to make certain representations to its clients 
our access to the capital markets and its ability to make timely sec filings could be impaired if the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  if arthur andersen becomes unable to make the required representations to us or if for any other reason arthur andersen is unable to perform required audit related services for us 
in such a case  we would promptly seek to engage a new independent public accounting firm or take such other actions as may be necessary to enable us to maintain access to the capital markets and to timely file our financial reports 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our investment policy restricts us to investing only in investment grade securities 
a failure of these investment securities to perform at their historical levels could reduce the interest income realized by us 
we have cash flow exposure to changing interest rates on our borrowings against our equipment financing line at variable interest rates 
any borrowings under our credit facility are also sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our accounts receivable based credit facility and  outstanding under our equipment financing facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of such debt is also subject to market risk 
as of december   the fair value of our long term debt did not differ materially from its carrying value
