cautionary statement certain statements that gillette may make from time to time  including statements contained in this report  constitute forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
forward looking statements may be identified by words such as plans  expects  believes  anticipates  estimates  projects  will and other words of similar meaning used in conjunction with  among other things  discussions of future operations  acquisitions and divestitures  financial performance  gillette s strategy for growth  product development and new product launches  market position and expenditures 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations of future events  but actual results could vary materially from gillette s expectations and projections 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
gillette assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
gillette cautions that historical results should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by  or on behalf of  gillette include the following  some of which are described in greater detail below the pattern of gillette s sales  including variations in sales volume within periods  consumer demands and preferences including the acceptance by gillette s customers and consumers of new products and line extensions  the mix of products sold  gillette s ability to control its internal costs and the cost of raw materials  competitive factors including the prices  promotional incentives and trade terms of gillette s products  the response of gillette  its customers and competitors to changes in these terms  technological advances by gillette and or its competitors  new patents granted to gillette and or its competitors  changes in exchange rates in one or more of gillette s geographic markets  changes in accounting policies  acquisition and divestiture activities  or the impact of general economic conditions in the united states and in other countries in which gillette currently does business 
competitive environment gillette experiences intense competition for sales of its products in most markets 
gillette s products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which typically are sold at lower prices 
in most of its markets  gillette has major competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified than gillette 
aggressive competition within gillette s markets to preserve  gain or regain market share can affect gillette s results in any given period 
changes in technology and new product introductions in most product categories in which gillette competes  there are continuous technological changes and frequent introductions of new products and line extensions 
gillette s ability to successfully introduce new products and or extend lines of existing products will depend on  among other things  gillette s ability to identify changing consumer tastes and needs  develop new technology  differentiate its products and gain market acceptance of new products 
gillette cannot be certain that it will successfully achieve these goals 
with respect specifically to primary alkaline batteries  category growth could be adversely affected by the following additional factors technological or design changes in portable electronic and other devices that use batteries as a power source  continued improvement in the service life of primary batteries  improvements in rechargeable battery technology  and the development of new battery technologies 
intellectual property gillette relies upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in technology  products and gillette s brands 
gillette s intellectual property rights  however  could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
gillette does not believe that its products infringe the intellectual property rights of others  but such claims  if they are established  can result in material liabilities or loss of business 
cost savings strategy gillette has implemented a number of programs designed to reduce costs 
such programs will require  among other things  the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures  all of which present significant management challenges 
there can be no assurance that such actions will be accomplished as rapidly as anticipated or that the full extent of expected cost reductions will be achieved 
sales and operations outside of the united states sales outside of the united states represent a substantial portion of gillette s business 
in addition  gillette has a number of manufacturing facilities and suppliers located outside of the united states 
accordingly  the following factors could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period changes in political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tax laws  or longer payment cycles in certain countries 
gillette also is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk to its sales  profits  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
although gillette uses instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks through foreign currency forward  swap and option contracts and non us dollar denominated financings and is implicitly hedged through its foreign manufacturing operations  there can be no assurance that gillette will be fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations 
retail environment with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  especially in developed markets such as the united states and europe  gillette is increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
accordingly  gillette faces greater pressure from retail trade customers to provide more favorable trade terms 
gillette can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space and other conditions 
many of gillette s customers  particularly gillette s high volume retail trade customers  have engaged in accelerated efforts to reduce inventory levels and shrinkage and change inventory delivery systems 
while gillette expects the level of trade inventory of its products to decline over time  the speed and magnitude of such reductions and or the inability of gillette to develop satisfactory inventory delivery systems could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period 
effect of terrorist acts on our business the terrorist acts of september   the military response  the actual and perceived threat of further terrorist acts and future possible military and political actions have created an atmosphere of economic uncertainty in the united states and in foreign markets and our results may be impacted by adverse macroeconomic effects of those events  especially if the conditions persist 
further  direct attacks or threats on or against our personnel and facilities around the world  our suppliers  customers and other elements of our supply chain and the infrastructures in which our facilities are located could significantly disrupt our business and its prospects  at least in the short term 
while we have taken all prudent precautions against foreseeable threats  recent events have proven that the object of terrorist activities is inherently uncertain 
any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flow or profit from operations in any reporting period
